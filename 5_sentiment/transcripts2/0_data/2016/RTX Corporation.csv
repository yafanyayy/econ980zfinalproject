159230,321594109,921372,"United Technologies Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Okay, thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion a",842,"Okay, thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion and segment operating margins were a solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.50 a share. That's on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. 
As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all, we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners. And most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones. 
As you know we announced and closed the sale of Sikorsky for a very good price, $9 billion, and that generated a $3.4 billion after-tax gain in the fourth quarter and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November. As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses as creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile. It will have higher operating margins and will have stronger cash flows.
We've also simplified the organization. We eliminated the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems layer and the building and industrial systems layer. That creates a flatter, more efficient structure with greater visibility and, importantly, greater accountability. And we now have 4 focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth. 
On the cost front, we announced $1.5 billion of multiyear restructuring plans. That included $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. That restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million of run rate savings by 2019. 
We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividends and share repurchase. That includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR this year, we continued to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends for the year. Clearly, the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock. We'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there's a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price.
Well, this program execution continues to be a top priority, and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt-powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the Marines back in July. The A320neo aircraft was certified. The C-Series aircraft was certified, both with Pratt's geared turbofan engines and number of UTAS systems. The Mitsubishi regional jet also had its first flight and the Embraer air engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well.
I'm proud to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality. The first Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday, and we're meeting our commitments on day 1 for fuel burn, emissions and noise for the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to on day 1. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus. And let me be crystal clear, we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan. 
On the commercial side, we continued to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel, the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The Climate, Controls & Security, we secured the new [indiscernible] stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Center in Kuwait, to name just a few. So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015. And as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. That is, first of all, flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and most importantly perhaps, disciplined capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling costs while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long term.
So despite this mixed macroenvironment that we're all facing, UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value. 
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full year results. And I'll be back with a few closing comments and Q&A. Akhil?"
159230,321594109,921372,"United Technologies Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and an",995,"Thanks, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items. As we told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So let me walk you through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation. 
The largest item is a $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 [ph] million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax-related items. Roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years. Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters. $0.21 of that was at Aerospace Systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations including the enhancement of our contractual position on a key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination.
At corporate, we recognize the liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim trend data and, most importantly, recent agreements reached with insurers. On the other side of the ledger, you'll recall, in Q1, we had a gain on a fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture. That was a $0.14 benefit. .
Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges resulting in free cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number, the benefit from net noncash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.
Moving to Slide 3. Organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2% primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business, and Asia was down 1% due to China, where sales were down 4%. Growth in commercial aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compare on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS. 
I'm pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain delays experience in Q3 at the New England Logistics Center or NELC. They're back to their pre-NELC delivery cadence and were on schedule with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 4. And just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis where North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trends here. At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in military. For the full year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year.
EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were strong up 20%. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while Fire & Security products orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full year. On the other hand, CCS Fire & Security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat, an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.
Moving to aerospace. Revenue passenger miles continued to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, [indiscernible] commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter including a 3 point benefit from sale of legacy engine hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activities. 
Now before I let Paul take you through the additional details for 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economy as the year progresses and easier compares in the second half, we expect 2016 to be back-end loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings. Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt. Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension tailwind. As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60. 
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an 8 point headwinds to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign-currency-related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter. New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid-single digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by a 5% decline in EMEA. New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20% with strong growth in most major markets excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14%. That's 8% on a unit basis while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15% excluding the impact of the Thompson line at Metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year. For the full year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a 9-point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA, partially offset by a 10% decline in Asia, driven by the 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 3% at constant currency with 3 points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to both sales and earnings. During the quarter, we saw continued sales growth in HVAC in North America where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well, up 4% organically, and Asia was down 7% driven by lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the Fire & Security product and field businesses globally. The Fire & Security business in China was up 9%. Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter with mid-single-digit growth in Transicold offset by mid-single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by last year's tough compare Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter. In the Fire & Security business, we were down mid-single digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector. For the full year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency, driven by a drop-through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity including lower commodity costs.
Shifting to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter supported by low teens growth in the commercial engines business, primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from the sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries and large commercial OE sales were also down 15%, primarily on engine mix as Pratt shipped more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000s than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume, along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind, were largely offset by a drop-through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience. For the full year, Pratt sales were down 1% organically, driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter. Consistent with the last 3 quarters, sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales, the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter, with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of 1 0. Military OE sales were down high-single digit in the quarter, driven by declines in the C-17 and other programs and the military aftermarket was down as well, about 1%. Aerospace Systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds are partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter. For the full year, Aerospace Systems sales grew 3% organically with about 2 points of benefit from the pass-through sales mentioned before. Profits for Aerospace Systems were down 3% for the year driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by continued benefits from the productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.
So with that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

With the actions we've taken, we are much better positioned for the future. There is, of course, some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. If you think about the 3 biggest markets for UTX, starting with the U.S., I think it's a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January. China, as you know, is working through some structural challenges. And in Europe, we're starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace. Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year. China will be down for 2016, but let's keep China in perspective. While it's certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebalance its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see 100 million people urbanized in the next 5 years or so in China. And by 2025 there forecast to be 221 million cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants. Just to put that in perspective today, in Europe, there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. So urbanization will continue to be a powerful force and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward.
On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow. We saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth, and the airlines are making money and the backlogs are there. Right now for UTC, it's about program execution and program costs. Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 and sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. 
Given the portfolio and the team we have today, I've never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle class, have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future. And all of this will create long-term shareowner value. 
It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern life and are installed and service for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial are balanced between new equipment and service and our balance geographically would help us whether these uncertain times. 
Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition at Pratt, I'd like to, first of all, take a minute to welcome Bob [indiscernible] back to UTC. You recall, Bob is the new President at Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams' retirement earlier this month. As you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky, and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year. I'd also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last 6 years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul nothing but success in the future. 
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call to questions. Kaylie?"

We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvements that Otis is continuing to push for. A part of a big commodity tailwind that we're seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side. Remember, they have 40,000 service vehicles. So the lower the gap lean [ph] prices are, the better it is from our service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net, pricing is probably slightly higher than what we were thinking in December. Now with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian, keep in mind, we took this -- a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter which impacted margin by nearly 100 basis points, which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that, Q4 margins were not back far out of line versus our 2016 guidance."

As I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You're exactly right. There is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year. No change to the full year however. We still expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines. Most of those, of course, will go to Airbus. There will be some going to Bombardier for the C-Series aircraft. But I think we're following the lead of Airbus on this, but we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly entering the service, and we want to have flawless entry in the service across all of the airline customers and this gives us the opportunity to ensure if that exactly happens. So far, it's been wonderful at Lufthansa this week since we put the engine into service and we expect that trend to continue. The engine's in great shape technically, and we will focus again on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there. He spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this, and this is going to be the game for Pratt this year."

But first of all, just go back to your first comment, Paul's retirement was sudden. It wasn't expected, but you've got to give Paul credit. He's the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification. And working nonstop for the last 6 years, you understand why Paul wanted to take a pause. We're very fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of Sikorsky to hit the ground running over there, and Bob knows the business. He was at Pratt for more than 30 years. He's with UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operations side, and the team is focused on it. I think again this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us a chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. I'll tell you, Howard, with all of the money that we have spent on the capital and infrastructure within UTC operations, I'm confident that we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don't take long to assemble. It's a question of just making sure all of the parts are there on time, and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down. So just because Bob's coming in, there is no change to Pratt's guidance, let me be clear on that. There's no change to the ramp schedule. '17 is, I would remind you, 12 months away. I'm not going to give guidance on '17, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we'll be able to meet their requirements going out over the next couple of years."

The starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what customers would've liked. These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware again, relatively simple to do, not a big cost. And I think importantly, it doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or emissions on the engine. These are really pretty minor changes.

The fact of the matter is, you got to keep doing this. This isn't -- the DNA of UTC is to take cost out to do more with less.

It's 75% better on noise when the engine is replacing, and it's been proven in both the development program and the flight test to meet all of those type of criteria.

As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp-up. Again, we're ramping down the the V2500, ramping up the GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine. The fact is there's probably 5 or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Ledoux and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis.

Modernization backlog is actually up, so that should start to turn around as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and modernization improving should start to turn that, but it is going to be a slow process, as you said, Jeff. It's not going to be -- turn right away."

We talked about Europe, new equipment orders or EMEA new equipment orders being up 20%. They're also up better than 20% for the year including Western Europe, which was also up double digits, so that's encouraging. And then to Akhil's point on the mod side, if you look at the end of 2014, we finished the year with mod backlog down in the teens. It was essentially flat in '15 or flat, but we'd rather see up, but it's certainly a better starting point going into '16 than what we saw last year."

Can you just provide a little bit more color on why that disconnect has developed and what is the way you think that one is the leading indicator over the other? Meaning, does HVAC and Fire & Security begin to follow Otis? Or are we going to begin to see a reversal of Otis and see some better things to come more in line with what we got in HVAC and Fire & Security?"

So it's not surprising to see with Otis orders down a lot more than the rest of the business. On the commercial industrial side, you see again orders were flattish at our commercial HVAC business. That's really what we see in the overall economy, industrial economy. Not much growth. It's not declining the same with the residential space is. I mean if you look at the fire products, that is really more of a consumer-driven purchase as opposed to the residential construction or even industrial, and that was up 8%. So as China makes this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of these trends continue. But urbanization is not done, as I said. You still got a huge population of people living in the cities. We're not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there. We see a lot more growth I think on the service side. Otis' service business, I think we were servicing 165,000 elevators at the end of the year. That's at about 20%. We expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into '16. So the dynamics are not unexplainable. I think you just need to peel it back away or understand the individual dynamics of the businesses."

So definitely, benefit to Pratt 4 or 5 years out of about $100 million or so a year. With regard to overall, the cash charges, a lot of these payments -- the Canadian payment, which is the largest one of the $15 billion charge that you refer to, is cash. In 2016, we would probably have a $500 million cash outflow as a result of these charges that we've taken in Q4 of this year, roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250 million or so for this tax-related cash repatriation, if you will, right? So that impact -- the rest of it will follow over the course of the next few years."

Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion,",843,"Okay. Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion, and segment operating margins were a solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share. That's on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all, we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners. And most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.
As you know, we announced this -- and closed the sale of Sikorsky for a very good price, $9 billion, and that generated a $3.4 billion after-tax gain in the fourth quarter and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November. As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses as creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, will have higher operating margins and will have stronger cash flows.
We've also simplified the organization. We eliminated the Propulsion & Aerospace Systems layer and the Building & Industrial Systems layer. That creates a flatter, more efficient structure with greater visibility and, importantly, greater accountability. And we now have 4 focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth.
On the cost front, we announced $1.5 billion multiyear restructuring plan. That included $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. That restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million of run rate savings by 2019.
We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividends and share repurchase. That includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR this year, we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends for the year. Clearly, the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock. We'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price.
Flawless program execution continues to be a top priority, and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt-powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the Marines back in July. The A320neo aircraft was certified. The CSeries aircraft was certified, both with Pratt's Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems. The Mitsubishi regional jet also had its first flight, and the Embraer engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well.
I'm proud to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality. The first Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday. And we're meeting our commitments on day 1 for fuel burn, emissions and noise, and the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to on day 1. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus. And let me be crystal clear: we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.
On the commercial side, we continued to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel, the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. At Climate, Controls & Security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait, to name just a few.
So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015. And as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. That is, first of all, flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and, most importantly perhaps, disciplined capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long term. So despite this mixed macro environment that we're all facing, UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full year results. And I'll be back with a few closing comments and Q&A. Akhil?"

That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly, excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items; as we told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.
The largest item is a $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax-related items. Roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years. Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters. $0.21 of that was at Aerospace Systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on a key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination. At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim trend data and, most importantly, recent agreements reached with insurers. On the other side of the ledger, you'll recall in Q1, we had a gain on a fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture. That was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in free cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number, the benefit from net noncash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.
Moving to Slide 3. Organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2%, primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business. And Asia was down 1% due to China, where sales were down 4%. Growth in commercial aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compare on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS.
I am pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain delays they experienced in Q3 at the New England Logistics Center or NELC. They are back to their pre-NELC engine delivery cadence and were on schedule with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 4. And just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio.
In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trends here. At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in inventory [ph]. For the full year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year.
EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were strong, up 20%. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full year. On the other hand, CCS fire and security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat, an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.
Moving to aerospace. Revenue passenger miles continue to grow slightly above the long-term trend rate, and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, [indiscernible] commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a 3-point benefit from sale of legacy engine hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activities.
Now before I let Paul take you through the additional details for 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economy as the year progresses and easier compares in the second half, we expect 2016 to be back-end-loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings. Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt. Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension tailwind. As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an 8-point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign-currency-related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter. New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid-single digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by a 5% decline in EMEA.
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20%, with strong growth in most major markets excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14%. That's 8% on a unit basis; while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15%, excluding the impact of the Thompson line metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.
For the full year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a 9-point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA, partially offset by a 10% decline in Asia, driven by the 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 3% at constant currency, with 3 points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to both sales and earnings. During the quarter, we saw continued sales growth in HVAC in North America, where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well, up 4% organically. And Asia was down 7%, driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and field businesses globally. The Fire & Security business in China was up 9%. Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in Transicold offset by mid-single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by last year's tough compare at Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter. In the Fire & Security business, we were down mid-single digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector.
For the full year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency, driven by a drop-through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity, including lower commodity costs.
Shifting to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter, supported by low teens growth in the commercial engines business primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from the sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries. And large commercial OE sales were also down 15%, primarily on engine mix as Pratt shipped more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000s than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume, along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind, were largely offset by a drop-through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.
For the full year, Pratt sales were down 1% organically, driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter. Consistent with the last 3 quarters, sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales, the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter, with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares [ph] finished the year with a book-to-bill of 1 0. Military OE sales were down high single digit in the quarter, driven by declines in the C-17 and other programs. And the military aftermarket was down as well, about 1%.
Aerospace Systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.
For the full year, Aerospace Systems sales grew 3% organically, with about 2 points of benefit from the pass-through sales mentioned before. Profits for Aerospace Systems were down 3% for the year, driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.
So with that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, I am encouraged by the progress the team is making. With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future.

With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future. There is, of course, some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. If you think about the 3 biggest markets for UTX, starting with the U.S., I think it's a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January. China, as you know, is working through some structural challenges. And in Europe, we're starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace.
Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets, and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year. China will be down for 2016, but let's keep China in perspective. While it's certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebalance its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer-consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see 100 million people urbanized in the next 5 years or so in China. And by 2025, there are forecast to be 221 million (sic) [ 221 ] cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants. Just to put that in perspective today, in Europe, there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. So urbanization will continue to be a powerful force, and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward.
On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow. We saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth. And the airlines are making money, and the backlogs are there. Right now, for UTC, it's about program execution and program costs.
Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
Given the portfolio and the team we have today, I've never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle class, have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future. And all of these will create long-term shareowner value.
It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern life and are installed and serviced for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service, and our balance geographically would help us weather these uncertain times.
Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition at Pratt. I'd like to, first of all, take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You'll recall Bob is the new President at Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams' retirement earlier this month. As you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky, and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year.
I'd also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last 6 years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul very -- nothing but success in the future.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kaylie?"

We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter, and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvement that Otis is continuing to push for. A part of a big commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side. They -- remember, they have 40,000 service vehicles. So the lower the gasoline prices are, the better it is from a service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net, pricing is probably slightly higher than what we were thinking in December. Now with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian, keep in mind we took this -- a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margin by nearly 100 basis points, which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that, Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance."

I -- as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You're exactly right. There is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year; no change to the full year, however. We still expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines. Most of those, of course, would go to Airbus. There will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft. But I think -- again, we're following the lead of Airbus on this, but we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly, entering the service. And we want to have flawless entry in the service across all of the airline customers, and this gives us the opportunity to ensure that, that exactly happens. So far, it's been wonderful at Lufthansa this week since we put the engine into service, and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically, and we will focus again on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there. He spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this, and this is going to be the game for Pratt this year."

Paul's retirement was sudden. It wasn't expected, but you've got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification, and working nonstop for the last 6 years. You understand why Paul wanted to take a pause. We're very fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of Sikorsky to hit the ground running over there, and Bob knows the business. He was at Pratt for more than 30 years. He's been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operations side, and the team is focused on it. I think, again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us a chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. But I'll tell you, Howard, with all of the money that we have spent on the capital of infrastructure within UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don't take long to assemble. It's a question of just making sure all of the parts are there on time, and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down. So just because Bob is coming in, there is no change to Pratt's guidance. Let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. '17 is, I'll remind you, 12 months away. I'm not going to give guidance on '17, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we'll be able to meet their requirements going over the next couple of years."

It's -- we continue to make progress there. I think we talked about this in detail in December. I would tell you that the Pratt team has identified the fixes as a software fix and a minor hardware fix. Just to be clear, every next-generation commercial engine out there has to cool down to a uniform thermal before they start the engine. So this is not something endemic just to the GTF. The starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what the customers would have liked. These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware, again, are relatively simple to do, not a big cost, and, I think importantly, doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or emissions on the engine. These are really pretty minor changes. If you guys are looking for something to worry about, worry about things we don't control, like FX. I wouldn't worry about the technical aspects of this GTF. It is rock solid."

You saw a big payoff from that restructuring, in fact almost $3 billion of run rate savings. We will continue to see savings on this next tranche of restructuring. It's about $1.5 billion over 4 years from '15 through '18. By 2019, you should see about $900 million of run rate savings. The fact of the matter is, you've got to keep doing this. This is in the DNA of UTC. It's to take cost out to do more with less. It's about productivity every day because the world just gets more competitive.

I would also put our SG&A rates against any industrial company, and you'll see that our aerospace companies are best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, as are our commercial companies. So all of that has been fueled. Where we need to continue to work on is reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December, where we have 42 million square feet that -- of which 22 million are still in high-cost locations, and we need to continue to work on that.

So where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20-years-plus of variable, high-royalty payments looking ahead for us. And all we did was crystallize that lability into a certain payment at this point of time, which we will pay off in 4 years. Net-net, it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us.

We've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines, keep in mind. As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp-up. Again, we're ramping down the V2500, ramping up the GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine. The fact is there's probably 5 or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Leduc and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis. We've been putting a lot of resources in the supply chain. So -- and there's no one supplier I would call out here other than to say that we're on top of all of the suppliers, making sure that they meet their commits.

So it's not surprising to see the Otis orders down a lot more than the rest of the business. On the commercial and industrial side, you see, again, orders were flattish at -- on our commercial HVAC business. That's really what we see in the overall economy, industrial economy. There are not much growth. It is not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean, if you look at the fire products, that is really more of a consumer-driven purchase as opposed to residential construction or even industrial, and that was up 8%. So as China makes this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of these trends continue. But urbanization is not done, as I said. You've still got a huge population of people living in the cities. We're not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there.

Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion,",843,"Okay. Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion, and segment operating margins were a solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share. That's on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all, we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners. And most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.
As you know, we announced this -- and closed the sale of Sikorsky for a very good price, $9 billion, and that generated a $3.4 billion after-tax gain in the fourth quarter and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November. As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses as creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, will have higher operating margins and will have stronger cash flows.
We've also simplified the organization. We eliminated the Propulsion & Aerospace Systems layer and the Building & Industrial Systems layer. That creates a flatter, more efficient structure with greater visibility and, importantly, greater accountability. And we now have 4 focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth.
On the cost front, we announced $1.5 billion multiyear restructuring plan. That included $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. That restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million of run rate savings by 2019.
We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividends and share repurchase. That includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR this year, we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends for the year. Clearly, the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock. We'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price.
Flawless program execution continues to be a top priority, and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt-powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the Marines back in July. The A320neo aircraft was certified. The CSeries aircraft was certified, both with Pratt's Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems. The Mitsubishi regional jet also had its first flight, and the Embraer engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well.
I'm proud to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality. The first Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday. And we're meeting our commitments on day 1 for fuel burn, emissions and noise, and the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to on day 1. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus. And let me be crystal clear: we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.
On the commercial side, we continued to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel, the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. At Climate, Controls & Security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait, to name just a few.
So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015. And as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. That is, first of all, flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and, most importantly perhaps, disciplined capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long term. So despite this mixed macro environment that we're all facing, UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full year results. And I'll be back with a few closing comments and Q&A. Akhil?"

Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and a",994,"Thanks, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly, excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items; as we told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.
The largest item is a $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax-related items. Roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years. Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters. $0.21 of that was at Aerospace Systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on a key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination. At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim trend data and, most importantly, recent agreements reached with insurers. On the other side of the ledger, you'll recall in Q1, we had a gain on a fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture. That was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in free cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number, the benefit from net noncash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.
Moving to Slide 3. Organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2%, primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business. And Asia was down 1% due to China, where sales were down 4%. Growth in commercial aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compare on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS.
I am pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain delays they experienced in Q3 at the New England Logistics Center or NELC. They are back to their pre-NELC engine delivery cadence and were on schedule with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 4. And just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio.
In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trends here. At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in inventory [ph]. For the full year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year.
EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were strong, up 20%. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full year. On the other hand, CCS fire and security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat, an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.
Moving to aerospace. Revenue passenger miles continue to grow slightly above the long-term trend rate, and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a 3-point benefit from sale of legacy engine hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activities.
Now before I let Paul take you through the additional details for 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economy as the year progresses and easier compares in the second half, we expect 2016 to be back-end-loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings. Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt. Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension tailwind. As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an 8-point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign-currency-related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter. New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid-single digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by a 5% decline in EMEA.
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20%, with strong growth in most major markets excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14%. That's 8% on a unit basis; while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15%, excluding the impact of the Thompson line metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.
For the full year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a 9-point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA, partially offset by a 10% decline in Asia, driven by the 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 3% at constant currency, with 3 points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to both sales and earnings. During the quarter, we saw continued sales growth in HVAC in North America, where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well, up 4% organically. And Asia was down 7%, driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and field businesses globally. The Fire & Security business in China was up 9%. Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in Transicold offset by mid-single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by last year's tough compare at Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter. In the Fire & Security business, we were down mid-single digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector.
For the full year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency, driven by a drop-through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity, including lower commodity costs.
Shifting to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter, supported by low teens growth in the commercial engines business primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from the sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries. And large commercial OE sales were also down 15%, primarily on engine mix as Pratt shipped more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000s than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume, along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind, were largely offset by a drop-through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.
For the full year, Pratt sales were down 1% organically, driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter. Consistent with the last 3 quarters, sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales, the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter, with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of 1 0. Military OE sales were down high single digit in the quarter, driven by declines in the C-17 and other programs. And the military aftermarket was down as well, about 1%.
Aerospace Systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.
For the full year, Aerospace Systems sales grew 3% organically, with about 2 points of benefit from the pass-through sales mentioned before. Profits for Aerospace Systems were down 3% for the year, driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.
So with that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, I am encouraged by the progress the team is making. With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future.

With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future. There is, of course, some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. If you think about the 3 biggest markets for UTX, starting with the U.S., I think it's a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January. China, as you know, is working through some structural challenges. And in Europe, we're starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace.
Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets, and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year. China will be down for 2016, but let's keep China in perspective. While it's certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebalance its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer-consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see 100 million people urbanized in the next 5 years or so in China. And by 2025, there are forecast to be 221 million (sic) [ 221 ] cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants. Just to put that in perspective today, in Europe, there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. So urbanization will continue to be a powerful force, and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward.
On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow. We saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth. And the airlines are making money, and the backlogs are there. Right now, for UTC, it's about program execution and program costs.
Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
Given the portfolio and the team we have today, I've never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle class, have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future. And all of these will create long-term shareowner value.
It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern life and are installed and serviced for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service, and our balance geographically would help us weather these uncertain times.
Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition at Pratt. I'd like to, first of all, take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You'll recall Bob is the new President at Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams' retirement earlier this month. As you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky, and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year.
I'd also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last 6 years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul very -- nothing but success in the future.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kaylie?"

We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter, and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvement that Otis is continuing to push for. A part of a big commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side. They -- remember, they have 40,000 service vehicles. So the lower the gasoline prices are, the better it is from a service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net, pricing is probably slightly higher than what we were thinking in December. Now with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian, keep in mind we took this -- a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margin by nearly 100 basis points, which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that, Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance."

I -- as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You're exactly right. There is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year; no change to the full year, however. We still expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines. Most of those, of course, would go to Airbus. There will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft. But I think -- again, we're following the lead of Airbus on this, but we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly, entering the service. And we want to have flawless entry in the service across all of the airline customers, and this gives us the opportunity to ensure that, that exactly happens. So far, it's been wonderful at Lufthansa this week since we put the engine into service, and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically, and we will focus again on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there. He spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this, and this is going to be the game for Pratt this year."

Paul's retirement was sudden. It wasn't expected, but you've got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification, and working nonstop for the last 6 years. You understand why Paul wanted to take a pause. We're very fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of Sikorsky to hit the ground running over there, and Bob knows the business. He was at Pratt for more than 30 years. He's been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operations side, and the team is focused on it. I think, again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us a chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. But I'll tell you, Howard, with all of the money that we have spent on the capital of infrastructure within UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don't take long to assemble. It's a question of just making sure all of the parts are there on time, and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down. So just because Bob is coming in, there is no change to Pratt's guidance. Let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. '17 is, I'll remind you, 12 months away. I'm not going to give guidance on '17, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we'll be able to meet their requirements going over the next couple of years."

The starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what the customers would have liked.

In mid-'90s, when we started doing restructuring, it was 6%, and it is 16.7% now. And a lot of that margin expansion has been fueled by the continuous restructuring that we do, taking cost out. I would also put our SG&A rates against any industrial company, and you'll see that our aerospace companies are best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, as are our commercial companies. So all of that has been fueled. Where we need to continue to work on is reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December, where we have 42 million square feet that -- of which 22 million are still in high-cost locations, and we need to continue to work on that. So productivity is a way of life at UTC. As Greg said, it is part of the DNA, and we just need to keep doing that."

We had, in turn, promised certain jobs in Canada and certain supply-chain-related investments. And in return, we had to pay royalties for several years. So where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20-years-plus of variable, high-royalty payments looking ahead for us. And all we did was crystallize that liability into a certain payment at this point of time, which we will pay off in 4 years. Net-net, it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us. We've essentially given back the E&D funding that they had given to us. We've also taken advantage of a good exchange rate in the process. Canadian dollar is at a pretty decent rate right now.

As I think about the technical aspects of the engine, as I said before, this cooling issue has really proved to be a nonissue. We've got that issue behind us, I believe. And as far as the rest of the engine goes, so far, it's been rock solid. It's 15% better on fuel burn. It's 50% better on emissions. It's 75% better on noise when the engine is replacing. And it's been proven in both the development program and the flight test to meet all of those type of criteria. And I think you're going to see airlines lining up to get this. We've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines, keep in mind. As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp-up. Again, we're ramping down the V2500, ramping up the GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine. The fact is there's probably 5 or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Leduc and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis. We've been putting a lot of resources in the supply chain. So -- and there's no one supplier I would call out here other than to say that we're on top of all of the suppliers, making sure that they meet their commits. Keep in mind that 80% of this engine comes from the supply chain. So supply chain has to be perfectly synchronized with the build plan, and that's what we're working to ensure."

The other aspect is also that the modernization side of the service business has been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked itself out primarily in France, and I think we've hit bottom there. Modernization backlog is actually up. So that should start to turn around as well.

And that, of course, is the market that has been the most hurt by, I would say, the overbuilding and so maybe some of the over-leverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last 5 or 6 years. So it's not surprising to see the Otis orders down a lot more than the rest of the business. On the commercial and industrial side, you see, again, orders were flattish at -- on our commercial HVAC business. That's really what we see in the overall economy, industrial economy. There are not much growth. It is not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean, if you look at the fire products, that is really more of a consumer-driven purchase as opposed to residential construction or even industrial, and that was up 8%. So as China makes this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of these trends continue. But urbanization is not done, as I said. You've still got a huge population of people moving to the cities. We're not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there. We see a lot more growth, I think, on the service side. Otis' service business, I think we were servicing 165,000 elevators at the end of the year. That's up about 20%.

Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion,",843,"Okay. Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion, and segment operating margins were a solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share. That's on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all, we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners. And most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.
As you know, we announced this -- and closed the sale of Sikorsky for a very good price, $9 billion, and that generated a $3.4 billion after-tax gain in the fourth quarter and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November. As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses that's creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, it'll have higher operating margins and we'll have stronger cash flows.
We've also simplified the organization. We eliminated the Propulsion & Aerospace Systems layer and the Building & Industrial Systems layer. That creates a flatter, more efficient structure with greater visibility and, importantly, greater accountability. And we now have 4 focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth.
On the cost front, we announced $1.5 billion multiyear restructuring plan. That included $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. That restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million in run rate savings by 2019.
We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividends and share repurchase. That includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR this year, we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends for the year. Clearly, the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock. We'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price.
Flawless program execution continues to be a top priority, and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt-powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the Marines back in July. The A320neo aircraft was certified. The CSeries aircraft was certified, both with Pratt's Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems. The Mitsubishi regional jet also had its first flight, and the Embraer engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well.
I'm proud to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality. The first Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday. And we're meeting our commitments on day 1 for fuel burn, emissions and noise, for the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to on day 1. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus. And let me be crystal clear: we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.
On the commercial side, we continue to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel, the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. At Climate, Controls & Security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait, to name just a few.
So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015. And as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. That is, first of all, flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and, most importantly perhaps, disciplined capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long term. So despite this mixed macro environment that we're all facing, UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full year results. And I'll be back with a few closing comments and Q&A. Akhil?"
159230,321594109,956165,"United Technologies Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly, excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and a",995,"Thanks, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly, excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items. As we told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.
The largest item is a $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax-related items. Roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years. Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters. $0.21 of that was at Aerospace Systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on a key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination. At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim trend data and, most importantly, recent agreements reached with insurers. On the other side of the ledger, you'll recall in Q1, we had a gain on a fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture. That was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in free cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number, the benefit from net noncash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.
Moving to Slide 3. Organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2%, primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business. And Asia was down 1% due to China, where sales were down 4%. Growth in commercial aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compare on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS.
I am pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain delays they experienced in Q3 at the New England Logistics Center or NELC. They are back to their pre-NELC engine delivery cadence and were on schedule with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 4. And just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio.
In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trends here. At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in unitary. For the full year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year.
EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were strong, up 20%. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full year. On the other hand, CCS fire and security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat, an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.
Moving to aerospace. Revenue passenger miles continue to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate, and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a 3-point benefit from sale of legacy engine hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activities.
Now before I let Paul take you through the additional details for 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economies as the year progresses and easier compares in the second half, we expect 2016 to be back-end loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings. Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt. Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension tailwind. As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an 8-point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign currency-related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter. New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid-single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by a 5% decline in EMEA.
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20%, with strong growth in most major markets excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14%, that's 8% on a unit basis, while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15%, excluding the impact of the Thomson Line metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.
For the full year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a 9-point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA, partially offset by a 10% decline in Asia, driven by the 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 3% at constant currency, with 3 points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to both sales and earnings. During the quarter, we saw continued sales growth in HVAC in North America, where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well, up 4% organically. And Asia was down 7%, driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and field businesses globally. The Fire & Security business in China was up 9%. Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in Transicold offset by mid-single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by last year's tough compare at Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter. In the Fire & Security business, we were down mid-single digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector.
For the full year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency, driven by drop-through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity, including lower commodity costs.
Shifting to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter, supported by low-teens growth in the commercial engines business primarily from the V2500, up 26% in the quarter, and approximately $60 million from the sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries. And large commercial OE sales were also down 15%, primarily on engine mix as Pratt shipped more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000s than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume, along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind, were largely offset by a drop-through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.
For the full year, Pratt sales were down 1% organically, driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter. Consistent with the last 3 quarters, sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales, the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter, with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of 1 0. Military OE sales were down high single digit in the quarter, driven by declines in the C-17 and other programs. And the military aftermarket was down as well, about 1%.
Aerospace Systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.
For the full year, Aerospace Systems sales grew 3% organically, with about 2 points of benefit from the pass-through sales mentioned before. Profits for Aerospace Systems were down 3% for the year, driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.
So with that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future. There is, of course, some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. If you think about the 3 biggest markets for UTX, starting with the U.S., I think it's a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January. China, as you know, is working through some structural challenges. And in Europe, we're starting to see signs that the recovery continues apace.
Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets, and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year. China will be down for 2016, but let's keep China in perspective. While it's certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebalances its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer-consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see 100 million people urbanized in the next 5 years or so in China. And by 2025, there are forecast to be 221 million (sic) [ 221 ] cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants. Just to put that in perspective today, in Europe, there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. So urbanization will continue to be a powerful force, and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward.
On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow. We saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth. And the airlines are making money, and the backlogs are there. Right now, for UTC, it's about program execution and program costs.
Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
Given the portfolio and the team we have today, I've never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle class, have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future. And all of these will create long-term shareowner value.
It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern life and are installed and serviced for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service and our balance geographically would help us weather these uncertain times.
Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition at Pratt. I'd like to, first of all, take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You'll recall Bob is the new President of Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams' retirement earlier this month. As you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky, and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year.
I'd also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last 6 years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul very -- nothing but success in the future.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kaylie?"

We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter, and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvements that Otis is continuing to push for. A part of a big commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side. They -- remember, they have 40,000 service vehicles. So the lower the gasoline prices are, the better it is from a service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net, pricing is probably slightly higher than what we were thinking in December. Now with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian, keep in mind we took this -- a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margins by nearly 100 basis points, which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that, Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance."

I -- as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You're exactly right. There is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year; no change to the full year, however. We still expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines. Most of those, of course, would go to Airbus. There will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft. But I think -- again, we're following the lead of Airbus on this, but we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly, entering the service. And we want to have flawless entry in the service across all of the airline customers, and this gives us the opportunity to ensure that, that exactly happens. So far, it's been wonderful at Lufthansa this week since we put the engine into service, and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically, and we will focus again on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there. He spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this, and this is going to be the game for Pratt this year."

Paul's retirement was sudden. It wasn't expected, but you've got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification, and working nonstop for the last 6 years. You understand why Paul wanted to take a pause. We're very fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of Sikorsky to hit the ground running over there, and Bob knows the business. He was at Pratt for more than 30 years. He's been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operations side, and the team is focused on it. I think, again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us a chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. But I'll tell you, Howard, with all of the money that we have spent on the capital and infrastructure within UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don't take long to assemble. It's a question of just making sure all of the parts are there on time, and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down. So just because Bob is coming in, there is no change to Pratt's guidance. Let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. '17 is, I'll remind you, 12 months away. I'm not going to give guidance on '17, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we'll be able to meet their requirements going over the next couple of years."

If you look at sort of across some of the other product lines, global commercial HVAC was down about 2%, driven by a softer North America. And both the fire and security products business and the field businesses were down a little bit as well. I guess one bright spot on the fire and security side was that China was actually up in the quarter about 8%, and that was driven by our fire detection and alarm business in Qinhuangdao.

The fact that new equipment orders are starting to be up and new equipment sales in EMEA was up in the fourth quarter as well, those will translate into service contracts further down the line. The other aspect is also that the modernization side of the service business has been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked itself out primarily in France, and I think we've hit bottom there. Modernization backlog is actually up. So that should start to turn around as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and modernization improving should start to turn that, but it is going to be a slow process, as you said, Jeff. It's not going to be turn right away."

And that, of course, is the market that has been the most hurt by, I would say, the overbuilding and maybe some of the overleverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last 5 or 6 years. So it's not surprising to see the Otis orders down a lot more than the rest of the business. On the commercial and industrial side, you see, again, orders were flattish at -- on our commercial HVAC business. That's really what we see in the overall economy, industrial economy. There are not much growth, but it's not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean, if you look at the fire products, that is really more of a consumer-driven purchase as opposed to residential construction or even industrial, and that was up 8%. So as China makes this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of these trends continue. But urbanization is not done, as I said. You've still got a huge population of people moving to the cities. We're not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there. We see a lot more growth, I think, on the service side. Otis is a service business. I think we were servicing 165,000 elevators at the end of the year. That's up about 20%. We expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into '16. So the dynamics are not unexplainable. I think you just need to peel it back a layer and understand the individual dynamics of the businesses."

So definitely benefit to Pratt 4, 5 years out of about $100 million or so a year. With regard to, overall, the cash charges, a lot of these payments -- the Canadian payment, which is the largest one of the $1.5 billion charge that you referred to, is cash. In 2016, we would probably have a $500 million cash outflow as a result of these charges that we have taken in Q4 of this year, roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250 million or so for this tax-related cash repatriation, if you will, right.

Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. This better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior-year compare",794,"Okay. Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. This better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior-year compare reflects solid operational performance. 
So we're off to a good start. As a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60. 
Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out in our December and March investor meeting. You can see these on Slide 1. First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better-than-expected Q1 results were truly a team effort, Pratt is ramping up production as planned. Our little town Connecticut and West Palm Beach engine centers had strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade, that includes both commercial and military engines. At our Climate, Controls & Security business, they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation while continuing to meet program and customer milestones. And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter despite China sales being down 3%. Also, new equipment orders in China grew 2% year-over-year on units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.
On the innovation front, there are now 5 A320s in revenue service, all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine, and they're providing our customers with better-than-expected performance. The dispatch or liability across the in-service fleet is over 99%, as great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program. 
In Carrier Transicold, we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated tractor-trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to an investment in sustainable technologies. 
On cost reduction, that's the way of life here at UTC. We got our SG&A in the quarter down year-over-year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best-in-class versus the peer group. 
And as always, we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We are proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years. We're also executing on the $6 billion share repurchase plan or ASR that was launched late last year. On top of that, we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareholders from 2015 to 2017. 
As always, we remain focused on what we can control, and this means driving productivity while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and, of course, increased shareholder value. 
Across the business, we continue to achieved significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt, as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the Neo, and the C-Series is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year. On the military side, where selected supply engine on the new B 21 long-range strike bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DOD programs for decades to come. 
As you know, we have strong content and new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well, and these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems. 
Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone. 
On the Otis side, in the quarter, we installed the world's largest double deck elevator at the World Tower tallest building. And announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center in Australia, which would be the tallest residential building in Melbourne. This is a few examples of many of where our investments in innovations are starting to pay off. 
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results and I'll be back with a few closing comes before we start to Q&A. Akhil?"
159230,330266957,963884,"United Technologies Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth and challenging macroenvironment. Once again, it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter",768,"Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth and challenging macroenvironment. Once again, it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate. However, for our commercial businesses, the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American commercial HVAC was up 4% and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above-normal Seer 13 shipments. Excluding VAT impact, resi sales were up high single digit in the quarter. 
Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid to high single-digit declines in Commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.
In China, Otis and Commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and Commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8%, respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business. Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt where the aftermarket was strong. On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.
Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to orders and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, their 16th consecutive quarter of growth. At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat. 
Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13% driven primarily by Russia. At CCS, Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%. 
As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions and exports have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization. At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, Commercial HVAC was down 6% and fire and security orders were down slightly. 
On the aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 '15 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.
Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the strong U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges. 
Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of 4 annual payments. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016. 
As Greg said, we are confident in our full year outlook, sales of $56 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With a solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year. 
With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?"

Thanks, Akhil. 10 turning to Otis on Slide 5, in the quarter, sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, more than offsetting drop-through from stronger volume in other areas. Foreign exchange translation was a 5 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter. Otis service sales were up low single-digit overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA. New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA, we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong, with orders up 11%. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline [ph] for Otis.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency with 1 point of growth from acquisitions, offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency, with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3 point headwind to both sales and profit. During the quarter, we saw continued growth in HVAC sales, with both North America residential and global Commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the fire and security business was down 4%, with a high single-digit decline in the global fire products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector. Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, with a nearly 25% decline at container business, offset by continuing growth in truck trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single digit. CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the Fire & Security and the Commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%. Military engines were also up in the quarter, with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines. OEM sales were down 12% and 15%, respectively, at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the investor meeting in March. Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines. As we expected, E&D was also higher in the quarter, and we continue to expect a second half spending decline as we approach entry into service for the C-Series and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs. Partially offsetting these headwinds were dropthrough from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year, we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1%, with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs. In line with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%, with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning. Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly. Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit on 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities. Unfavorable commercial mix largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop-through from lower military sales were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost-reduction actions and pension tailwind. For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost-reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year, we're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged of the progress we are making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March. 
As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We are confident in our full year 2016 outlook. As Akhil said, we've got some pretty significant contingency at the midpoint. So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macroenvironment remains uncertain. And like many other, we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of '16. And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS, pricing at Otis in both Europe and China and, of course, the aerospace aftermarket trends. So while we consider bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know where our contingency is. But also remember our practice that we continue to watch these trends and we'll revisit at the end of the second quarter. 
Okay, we also continue to believe UTC is well-positioned for the long-term. And that is ultimately our mission, focused portfolio, industry-leading franchises, we got innovative products in the pipeline and we also have global scale and lean cost structure. On top of that, solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about. These trends are real, as revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization and the global expansion of the class, all of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth, not just this year, but well into the future and, of course, translate into significant long-term shareholder value creation. 
So with that, let me turn it back to Kaylie and open up the call to questions."

The fact is this is a globally competitive marketplace that we operate in and we have to do what's right for everyone, shareowners, the employees, the communities that we operate. And so both tough decisions. We have plans in place to help employees with these transitions through our employee scholar program. And we offer people a full 4 years of college education at displaced by any of this outsourcing, we provide significant severance and outplace systems. All of those things you have to do, keeping in mind, you still have to do with some things.

If you go back and look at our last 4 quarters, the service in Europe had been down sort of mid-single-digit. And this quarter, it's down 1%. So it's a trend in the right direction. We saw growth in our portfolio in the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March, so that's another good sign. Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those 2 are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out. With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rates and value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we've seen some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning. So feel relatively good. It's 1 quarter, but the trends were encouraging."

It is good, as Akhil said, to see some stabilization. We've visited both the Otis brand offices as well as second-tier brands. I mean, they have good strategies. Again, I think as we saw in Spain, where we're in Madrid, the economy there has thought about one is getting a little bit better.

So no drama there. What will happen is we'll see better results from cost-reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year compared to first quarter, and the mix starts to get a little bit better, especially given what we saw with the decline in the legacy businesses in the first quarter this year.

That includes both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada. $60 million of the $70 million was negative engine margin, up year-over-year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pension. So that was the negatives in the Pratt EBIT. On the positive side, you had about $80 million drop-through from the higher commercial aftermarket, we had about $40 million good news from pensions and another $15 million from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all that, you are within rounding off $17 million up down year-over-year profit.

As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better-than-expected results were against the difficult prior year compare and reflects solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start. As a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60. 
Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March Investor Meeting, and you can see these on Slide 1. First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better-than-expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. 
At our Climate, Controls & Security business, they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation while continuing to meet program and customer milestones. And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter despite China sales being down 3%. Also, new equipment orders for -- orders in China grew 2% year-over-year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.
On the innovation front, there are now 5 A320s in revenue service all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine, and they're providing our customers with better-than-expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program. 
In Carrier Transicold, we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies. 
On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. We got our SG&A in the quarter down year-over-year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best-in-class versus the peer group. 
And as always, we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years. We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that, we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowner from 2015 to 2017. 
As always, we remain focused on what we can control, and this means driving productivity while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course, increased shareowner value. 
Across the business, we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt, as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo, and the C-Series is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year. On the military side, we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 long-range strike bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come. 
As you know, we have strong content and new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well, and these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems. 
Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone. 
On the Otis side. In the quarter, we installed the world's largest double deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center in Australia, which would be the tallest residential building in Melbourne. These are just a few examples of many of where our investments and innovations are starting to pay off. 
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results, and I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?"

As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter in what continues to be a slow-growth and challenging macro environment. Once again, it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate. However, for our commercial businesses, the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American Commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above-normal SEER-13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single digit in the quarter. 
Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid- to high single-digit declines in Commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.
In China, Otis and Commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and Commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8%, respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business. Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong. 
On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.
Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to orders and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth. At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat. Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven primarily by Russia. At CCS, Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%. 
As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions and exports, have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization. At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, Commercial HVAC was down 6%, and fire and security orders were down slightly. 
On the aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 '15 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.
Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges. 
Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of 4 annual payments. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016. 
As Greg said, we are confident in our full year outlook, sales of $56 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With the solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year. 
With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA more than offsetting drop-through from stronger volume in other areas. 
Foreign exchange translation was a 5 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter. 
Otis service sales were up low single digit overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA. 
New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA, we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong, with orders up 11%. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency, with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3 point headwind to both sales and profit. During the quarter, we saw continued growth in HVAC sales, with both North America residential and global Commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the fire and security business was down 4%, with a high single-digit decline in the global fire products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector. 
Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, with a nearly 25% decline at container business offset by continuing growth in truck trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single digit. CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the fire and security and the Commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%. Military engines were also up in the quarter, with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines. OEM sales were down 12% and 15%, respectively, at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the Investor Meeting in March. Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines. As we expected, E&D was also higher in the quarter, and we continue to expect a second half spending decline as we approach entry into service for the CSeries and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs. Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop-through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year, we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1%, with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs. In line with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%, with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning. 
Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly. 
Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit on 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities. Unfavorable commercial mix largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop-through from lower military sales were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind. For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged of the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March. 
As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got some pretty significant contingency at the midpoint. So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others, we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of '16. 
And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS; pricing at Otis in both Europe and China; and of course, the aerospace aftermarket trends. So while we consider bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends and will revisit this at the end of the second quarter. 
Okay. We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term, and that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio, industry-leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline, and we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that, solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about. These trends are real as revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth not just this year, but well into the future and of course, translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation. 
So with that, let me turn it back to Kaley and open up the call to questions."

We saw growth in our portfolio, and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March, so that's another good sign. Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those 2 are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out. With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rates in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we've seen some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning.

What will happen is we will see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year compared to first quarter.

Compares will be more difficult in the back half, especially in Q4, which was a decent quarter for Pratt, as you know, in commercial aftermarket. So we -- while we think there is upward pressure on aftermarket -- commercial aftermarket at Pratt, I'd like to wait for one more quarter and see the trends in Q2 before taking -- officially adjusting the guidance, if you will, for aftermarket for Pratt. UTAS, very much in line with what our expectations were. 1% growth in commercial aftermarket for first quarter, low single-digit growth for the full year, slightly better in the back half and first quarter largely on the back of provisioning and spare parts, and I think we have all on track."

We need to continue to drive the innovation theme as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result, you see the Otis margins are down this quarter, but that's okay. I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more products into the hands of the customers so that service can ultimately be the driver of growth. If you think about service in China today, it was up 15% in the first quarter at Otis. So we're getting momentum. Unit orders, as we said, were up 2%, even though overall orders were down a little bit in Otis China. So we're getting some traction, but more investments.

That includes both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada. $60 million of the $70 million was negative engine margin, up year-over-year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pension. So that was the negatives in the Pratt EBIT. On the positive side, you had about $80 million drop-through from the higher commercial aftermarket. We had about $40 million good news from pensions and another $15 million from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all that, you are within this -- within rounding off $17 million of down year-over-year profit.

Thank you, Kaley, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior year compare",809,"Okay. Thank you, Kaley, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start. As a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60. 
Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March Investor Meeting, and you can see these on Slide 1. First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better-than-expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. 
At our Climate, Controls & Security business, they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation while continuing to meet program and customer milestones. And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter despite China sales being down 3%. Also, new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year-over-year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.
On the innovation front, there are now 5 A320s in revenue service all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine, and they're providing our customers with better-than-expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program. 
In Carrier Transicold, we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies. 
On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. We got our SG&A in the quarter down year-over-year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best-in-class versus the peer group. 
And as always, we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years. We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that, we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017. 
As always, we remain focused on what we can control, and this means driving productivity while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course, increased shareowner value. 
Across the business, we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt, as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo, and the CSeries is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year. On the military side, we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 long-range strike bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come. 
As you know, we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well, and these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems. 
Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone. 
On the Otis side. In the quarter, we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center in Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne. These are just a few examples of many of where our investments and innovations are starting to pay off. 
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results, and I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?"

As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter in what continues to be a slow-growth and challenging macro environment. Once again, it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate. However, for our commercial businesses, the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American Commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above-normal SEER-13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single digit in the quarter. 
Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid- to high single-digit declines in Commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.
In China, Otis and Commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and Commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8%, respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business. Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong. 
On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.
Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth. At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat. Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven primarily by Russia. At CCS, Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%. 
As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions and exports, have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization. At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, Commercial HVAC was down 6%, and fire and security orders were down slightly. 
On the aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 '15 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.
Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges. 
Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of 4 annual payments. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016. 
As Greg said, we are confident in our full year outlook, sales of $56 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With the solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year. 
With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?"

In the quarter, sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA more than offsetting drop-through from stronger volume in other areas. 
Foreign exchange translation was a 5 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter. 
Otis service sales were up low single digit overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA. 
New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA, we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong, with orders up 11%. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency, with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3 point headwind to both sales and profit. During the quarter, we saw continued growth in HVAC sales, with both North America residential and global Commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the fire and security business was down 4%, with a high single-digit decline in the global fire products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector. 
Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, with a nearly 25% decline in the container business offset by continuing growth in truck trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single digit. CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the fire and security and the Commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%. Military engines were also up in the quarter, with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines. OEM sales were down 12% and 15%, respectively, at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the Investor Meeting in March. Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines. As we expected, E&D was also higher in the quarter, and we continue to expect a second half spending decline as we approach entry into service for the CSeries and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs. Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop-through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year, we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1%, with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs. In line with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%, with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning. 
Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly. 
Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit on 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities. Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop-through from lower military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind. For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

Hope you guys got all that. As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year. We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments.

We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged of the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March. 
As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint. So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others, we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of '16. 
And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS; pricing at Otis in both Europe and China; and of course, the aerospace aftermarket trends. So while we consider bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends and we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. 
Okay. We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term, and that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio, industry-leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline, and we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that, solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about. These trends are real as revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth not just this year, but well into the future and, of course, translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation. 
So with that, let me turn it back to Kaley and open up the call to questions."

We saw growth in our portfolio, and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March, so that's another good sign. Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those 2 are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out. With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rates in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we've seen some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning.

What will happen is we will see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year compared to first quarter.

We need to continue to drive the innovation theme as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result, you see the Otis margins are down this quarter, but that's okay. I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more products into the hands of the customers so that service can ultimately be the driver of growth.

And if you go back and look at our history, there have been quarters where we've been 44%, in fact as low as 34%, because I did look at that just to satisfy myself that we were still on track, and we've hit 100% of net income. So this year, with the aero ramp, we obviously do not want to disappoint our customers, and we are making sure that we have inventories and buffer stocks and all the things that Bob Leduc talked about, ahead of when our needs are, to some extent. We do expect still to be able to get to the 90% to 100% level, maybe towards the lower end of that range, but definitely towards the 90% to 100%."

Thank you, Kaley, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior year compare",809,"Okay. Thank you, Kaley, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better-than-expected results were against a difficult prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start. As a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60. 
Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March Investor Meeting, and you can see these on Slide 1. First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better-than-expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. 
At our Climate, Controls & Security business, they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation while continuing to meet program and customer milestones. And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter despite China sales being down 3%. Also, new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year-over-year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.
On the innovation front, there are now 5 A320s in revenue service all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine, and they're providing our customers with better-than-expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program. 
In Carrier Transicold, we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies. 
On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. We got our SG&A in the quarter down year-over-year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best-in-class versus the peer group. 
And as always, we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years. We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that, we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017. 
As always, we remain focused on what we can control, and this means driving productivity while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course, increased shareowner value. 
Across the business, we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt, as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo, and the CSeries is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year. On the military side, we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 long-range strike bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come. 
As you know, we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well, and these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems. 
Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone. 
On the Otis side. In the quarter, we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center in Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne. These are just a few examples of many of where our investments and innovations are starting to pay off. 
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results, and I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?"

As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter in what continues to be a slow-growth and challenging macro environment. Once again, it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate. However, for our commercial businesses, the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American Commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above-normal SEER-13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single digit in the quarter. 
Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid- to high single-digit declines in Commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.
In China, Otis and Commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and Commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8%, respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business. Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong. 
On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.
Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth. At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat. Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven primarily by Russia. At CCS, Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%. 
As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions and exports, have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization. At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, Commercial HVAC was down 6%, and fire and security orders were down slightly. 
On the aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 '15 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.
Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges. 
Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of 4 annual payments. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016. 
As Greg said, we are confident in our full year outlook, sales of $56 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With the solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year. 
With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?"

Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter, sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA more",917,"Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter, sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA more than offsetting drop-through from stronger volume in other areas. 
Foreign exchange translation was a 5 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter. 
Otis service sales were up low single digit overall as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA. 
New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA, we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong, with orders up 11%. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency, with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3 point headwind to both sales and profit. During the quarter, we saw continued growth in HVAC sales, with both North America residential and global Commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the fire and security business was down 4%, with a high single-digit decline in the global fire products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector. 
Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, with a nearly 25% decline in the container business offset by continuing growth in truck trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single digit. CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the fire and security and the Commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%. Military engines were also up in the quarter, with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines. OEM sales were down 12% and 15%, respectively, at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the Investor Meeting in March. Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines. As we expected, E&D was also higher in the quarter, and we continue to expect a second half spending decline as we approach entry into service for the CSeries and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs. Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop-through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year, we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1%, with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs. In line with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%, with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning. 
Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly. 
Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit on 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities. Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop-through from lower military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind. For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up."

We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged of the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March. 
As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint. So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others, we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of '16. 
And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS; pricing at Otis in both Europe and China; and of course, the aerospace aftermarket trends. So while we consider bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends and we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. 
Okay. We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term, and that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio, industry-leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline, and we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that, solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about. These trends are real as revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth not just this year, but well into the future and, of course, translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation. 
So with that, let me turn it back to Kaley and open up the call to questions."

We saw growth in our portfolio, and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March, so that's another good sign. Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those 2 are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out. With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rates in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we've seen some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning.

What will happen is we will see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year compared to first quarter.

We've doubled the R&D spend at Carrier on the -- especially focused on the big machines on the commercial side. So feel pretty good about where we are, but still a lot of work to do. I think this is the one area where Bob has got the team focused because, look, the rest of the business, I think, in the resi business in the U.S., very strong, solid, solid market share, good margins. Refrigeration business, as I said, lumpy, but still very, very solid from a market share perspective. Commercial HVAC, there's some work to do here."

Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth targets that we laid out back in March of this year. As I told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of underpromise and overdeliver is our goal again. As we're seeing results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance, Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82, up almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also, of course, raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15 in our expected adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60 and we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion, and we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low growth and volatile macroenvironment. 
I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through the details with 4 key takeaways from today. First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan's performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours of 4 operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions. Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnerships with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience. Third, we're also, of course, seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and we remain focus on cost reduction -- structural cost-reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year. Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize shareholder value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareholders from '15 through '17. And we recently announced 2 strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan and CCS acquired a 70% stake in [indiscernible] which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers, just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined. These are just a few of the many examples on why we're executing our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul who'll take you through the results and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?"

Organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging, consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady",1032,"Thank you, Greg. Taking a look at Slide 2. Organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging, consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3%-plus we would all like to see. During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower Commercial HVAC exports and Fire & Security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC. 
Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both traffic and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses. 
In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices, particularly in the Tier 1 cities, show growth year-to-date, the elevated new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3%, principally driven by China where, consistent with our expectations, we saw sales at Otis decline 7% while CCS sales in China were down 2%. 
Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid-single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket in Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8% driven by original equipment declines at Pratt primarily due to headwinds from the F-117 program, where, as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 and the cell [indiscernible] program is now complete. 
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3. Just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China, where orders were down 14% on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3% with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases of tough compares. Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid-single-digit growth in Fire & Security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low-single digits with mid-single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter. 
Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5% and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20% driven primarily by the V2500. 
Moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as 1 point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by a point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71, which included $0.11 of restructuring and other one-time significant items. As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition. 
Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued Aero ramp related investments at Pratt & Whitney. As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15 and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%. 
There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through. But as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segments. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year. Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit: one, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar; and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our financial expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact. 
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail."

Also note, we've included an Appendix on Page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings. New equipment sales increased 2% led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we've seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and in hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter. Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high-single digit growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better-than-expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better-than-expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million, that's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth. 
On the next page, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 1% at constant currency, with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was -- that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits. 
As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix, but to call out a few highlights. During the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential, it was the best June we've seen in about 7 years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continue to put pressure on the container business which was down 39%. 
Despite a softer top line, CCS continued to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8% driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continued to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected, with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security. 
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20% including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both pre-buy from the service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about 9 years old, and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity and we continue to see RPM growth. 
In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than Q1 but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016. 
For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets. Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop-through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D. 
We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from the product line sale and contract closeouts or headwind but were offset by favorable contract settlements and the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid-single digit. Drop-through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower-than-expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up, and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney. 
At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% -- on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on our next-generation platforms, partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 [indiscernible] retrofit program. Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations, an improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

For the meantime, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less, investing in innovation for growth, will be disciplined in our capital allocation, and most importantly, we're going to focus on executing on the record Aero backlog.

So it's about 9% price out of that delta which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not really -- I mean, overall, we think pricing per China is just slightly worse for the P&L. In fact, for this year, yes, the margin in backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is to greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions from suppliers and that's what they will do."

But clearly, I think on pensions side, we have no mandatory requirements to fund. Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there is no mandatory requirement for us to fund the domestic pension plan. But we will evaluate it as part of a normal cash utilization capital deployment plans and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary business but no call on it. The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially, with keeping the savings impact could benefit a little bit on the cash side. But again, that's small and it doesn't pay out in 1 year. It generally pays out over a couple of years. And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think as Greg has mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side to buffer stock, and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It's probably a multi-year effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels, which are very high standards, by the way, and I want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 ppm on quality. All that said, that in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or 2 more."

And as you look out over the next 10 years or so, you're going to see a big number there and close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin of all of these platforms that's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018. They will say about at that level. As even though production rates will increase, cost will come down, but that is a significant investment. The good news, of course, is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there in that 6-, 7-, 8-year time frame, the engines do need to be overhauled. You will see the returns but this is not a short-term game. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected which is well in excess of our cost of capital, but it's not for the faint of heart either.

I don't think you expect 2017 to materially accelerate from '16. Correct me if that's wrong. So you would kind of need '18, '19, '20 to be growing high-single digits organically. Is that realistic? And what makes that happen outside of the macro getting better?"

As you mentioned, with the 4 segments, I would tell you I've got the highest confidence in Pratt and the new test just based on the backlogs and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind, 200 GTF this year, then 400, then 800. They're ramping up almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF at all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced through volumes with the neo plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-Series, MRJ. All of those things give us pretty very high confidence of the organic outlook at Pratt. And similarly, at UTAS where the Aerospace Systems group, they've got line of sight, probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period. The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%. But we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D on new products. We're spending money on digital and the commercial side to enhance growth. So [indiscernible] a clear pathway. Now again, we assume the world is going to grow at 3% not 2%. And if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these new products, we could be in that 4%, 5% range as we move towards '17 or '18. But clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, urbanization -- when urbanization trends continue, the growth the middle class continues, all those things favor the commercial products. People need air-conditioners and people need elevators. So we're confident in product mix and in the growth outlook."

The content per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platforms than the platforms that are being replaced. And we've talked about going from 2 million per ship set to 4 million per ship set. So even though the production of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales, in any case. So I think Aerospace side has got a very high level of confidence. You don't have to go out and compete those every day again for the 2020 skyline. It's more the commercial businesses."

Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook, and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth targets that we laid out back in March of this year. As I've told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of underpromise and overdeliver is our goal again.
As we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance, Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share were up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also, of course, raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15 in our expected adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60, and we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low growth and volatile macro environment.
I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through the details with 4 key takeaways from today. First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours of 4 operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.
Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnerships with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.
Third, we're also, of course, seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts, and we remain focused on cost reduction -- structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter, and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.
Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize shareholder value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareholders from '15 through '17. And we recently announced 2 strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan, and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello, which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers, just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.
These are just a few of the many examples on why we're executing on our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul, who'll take you through the results, and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?"

Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong, and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3% plus we would all like to see. During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower commercial HVAC exports and fire and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC.
Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.
In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices, particularly in the Tier 1 cities, show growth year-to-date, the elevated new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3%, principally driven by China, where, consistent with our expectations, we saw sales at Otis decline 7%, while CCS sales in China were down 2%.
Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid-single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8%, driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where, as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year; and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 and nacelle retrofit program is now complete.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3. Just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China, where orders were down 14% on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis, however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3%, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases of tough compares.
Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration, which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid-single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC, entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single digit with mid-single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.
Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20%, driven primarily by the V2500.
Moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as 1 point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by 1 point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71, which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items. As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control, and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list, and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.
Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investments at Pratt & Whitney.
As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15, and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.
There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through. But as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segments. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.
Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit: one, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar; and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail."

Also note, we've included an appendix on Page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings. New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we have seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter. Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better-than-expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better-than-expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.
On the next page, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 1% at constant currency, with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was -- that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.
As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix. But to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season, but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential, it was the best June we have seen in about 7 years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continue to put pressure on the container business, which was down 39%.
Despite a softer top line, CCS continued to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continued to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected, with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20%, including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both prebuy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about 9 years old, and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity. And we continue to see RPM growth.
In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1 but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016. For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets.
Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop-through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.
We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind but were offset by favorable contract settlements and the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid-single digit. Drop-through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower-than-expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up, and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.
At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms, partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program.
Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates, and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations, an improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

We obviously raised the low end of the guidance by $0.15. We took up the revenue well under the revenue guidance. So we can be very comfortable about the year. But as Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro environment, and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020. We feel very confident about that plan.
For the meantime, though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less, investing in innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation, and most importantly, we're going to focus on executing on the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made in all of our businesses, we continue to be set up for above GDP growth well into the future.

Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right? We had last year's significant major projects at higher value per unit, and this year, that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of that delta, which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not really -- I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L. In fact, for this year, yes, the margin in backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China, is to get greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions from suppliers, and that's what they will do."

The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially, with keeping the savings impact could benefit a little bit on the cash side.

And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's -- as Greg has mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side to buffer stock, and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multiyear effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels, which are very high standards, by the way, all right?

They will stay about that level. As -- even though production rates will increase, costs will come down. But that is a significant investment. The good news, of course, is the aftermarket will come.

North America truck trailer was essentially flat, but orders were down, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, at least for the North America truck trailer piece, we're largely booked for the third quarter as we should be at this point, so I would say we're okay."

I didn't necessarily say it was usually weaker than expected. It was -- the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side, which was down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability.

So things look very positive from that standpoint. As far as production, I think, as Akhil or, I guess, Paul mentioned, going to build about 140 engines in the back half of the year. That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next 2 quarters. That's up from about 36 engines, I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half. So production ramp is continuing as we expect. A little pressure on negative margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up, but the good news is we're coming down the cost curve exactly as we had expected. We look at it every month.

Those were offset -- so $175 million of good news, offset by $70 million of negative engine margin; $50 million on the military mix issue that we have talked about before, F117 principally and others; another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D; and then the rest, about $50-plus million on Pratt Canada, OE shipment reduction and the ramp-up costs that we've talked about.

And Bob and the team are all over this, and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time with the software drops, they're pretty well addressed. And this just falls through behind us.

As you mentioned, with the 4 segments, I would tell you I've got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind, 200 GTF this year, then 400, then 800. We're ramping up almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF at all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced through those volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-Series, MRJ. All of those things give us very high confidence of the organic outlook at Pratt. And similarly, at UTAS, or at the Aerospace Systems group, they've got line of sight, probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period. The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%. But we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D on new products. We're spending money on digital in the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now again, we assume the world is going to grow at 3%, not 2%. And if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these new products, we could be in that 4% to 5% range as we move towards '17 or '18. But clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, urbanization trends continue, the growth of the middle class continues, all those things favor the commercial products. People need air-conditioners and people need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook."

So even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales, in any case.

Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook, and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth targets that we laid out back in March of this year. As I've told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of underpromise and overdeliver is our goal again.
And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance: Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also, of course, raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60. And we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low-growth and volatile macro environment.
I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through the details, but 4 key takeaways from today. First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours with 4 operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.
Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnerships with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.
Third, we're also, of course, seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts, and we remain focused on cost reduction -- structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter, and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.
Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize shareowner value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from '15 through '17. And we recently announced 2 strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan, and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello, which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers, just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.
These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing on our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results, and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?"

Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong, and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3%-plus we would all like to see. During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat, as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC.
Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.
In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices, particularly in the Tier 1 cities, show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3%, principally driven by China, where consistent with our expectations, we saw sales at Otis decline 7%, while CCS sales in China were down 2%.
Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid-single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8%, driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where, as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year; and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 nacelle retrofit program is now complete.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3. Just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China, where orders were down 14% on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis, however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3%, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA, in both cases off tough compares.
Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration, which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid-single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC, entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single digit with mid-single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.
Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20%, driven primarily by the V2500.
Moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year, as 1 point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by 1 point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71, which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items. As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control, and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings, as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list, and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.
Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investment at Pratt & Whitney.
As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15, and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.
There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through. But as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half, as well as some higher second half expenses below the segments. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.
Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit: one, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar; and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail."

Also note, we've included an appendix on Page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings. New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we have seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter. Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better-than-expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better-than-expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.
On the next page, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 1% at constant currency, with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was -- that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.
As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix. But to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss, midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season, but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential, it was the best June we have seen in about 7 years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continue to put pressure on the container business, which was down 39%.
Despite a softer top line, CCS continued to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continued to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected, with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20%, including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both prebuy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about 9 years old, and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity. And we continue to see RPM growth.
In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016. For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets.
Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop-through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.
We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements and the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid-single digit. Drop-through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower-than-expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up, and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.
At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms, partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program.
Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates, and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations, an improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And we've laid out a plan through 2020. We feel very confident about that plan.
For the meantime, though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less, investing in innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation, and most importantly, we're going to focus on executing on the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook.

And so it's not really -- I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin in the backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is, through greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions from suppliers, and that's what they will do."

Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year.

We will evaluate it as part of our normal cash utilization capital deployment plans and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it. The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially, with keeping the savings impact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side. But again, that's small and doesn't pay out in 1 year. It generally pays out over a couple of years. And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's -- as Greg has mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side to buffer stock, and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multiyear effort as we get our suppliers to performing in gold levels, which are very high standards, by the way, right? We want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 PPM on quality. All that said, in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or 2 more."

So the big phase of investment is really -- will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn down. At the same time, you should know we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over the next 10 years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin out of all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018, and it will stay about that level. As -- even though production rates will increase, costs will come down. But that is a significant investment. The good news, of course, is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there in that 6-, 7-, 8-year time frame, the engines do need to be overhauled, we will see the returns. But this is not a short-term game. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected, which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either.

We've added about 400 people to the supply chain this year to make sure that the suppliers have adequate plans in place to deliver on their commitments for the ramp. And some of that investment that we're making will continue on into next year. It's a little bit more than what we had originally expected, but it's what we need to do to make sure we get these engines out on time. So a little bit higher investment, but tracking exactly where we expected on costs."

We're going to build about 140 in the back half of the year, which is exactly what we talked about, or Bob Leduc talked about, back in March. So timing of revenue recognition might be a little different, as I said. But I think we -- actually, revenue recognized about 36 in the first half. Again, there's engines that are sitting there on the docks, sitting in transit. So feel good about the build plan. We're not going to come off of the 200. As far as the supply chain goes, there are always challenges. But if you think about this, with 8,000 parts and about 800 different subassemblies in this engine, there's a handful of parts that are causing some pain in the supply chain right now. And Bob and the team are all over this, and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time, with the software drops, have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are behind us. As I said, 99.8% dispatch reliability with the 4 operators, over 5,000 hours of revenue service since its introduction back in January. So the engine is performing exactly as we had expected and no surprises on costs, no surprises on delivery."

And I guess the numbers you reported today are pretty good, but we're still walking along these low single-digit organic revenue growth levels. Not a ton of reason, I don't think, to expect 2017 to materially accelerate from '16. Correct me if that's wrong. So you would kind of need '18, '19, '20 to be growing high single digits organically.

As you mentioned, with the 4 segments, I would tell you I've got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind, 200 GTF this year, then 400, then 800. We're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-Series, MRJ. All of those things give us very high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt. And similarly at UTAS, or at the Aerospace Systems group, they've got line of sight probably to 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period. The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%. But we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new products. We're spending money on digital in the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now again, we assume the world is going to grow at 3%, not 2%. And if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these new products, we could be in that 4% or 5% range as we move towards '17, '18. But clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, urbanization trends continue, the growth of the middle class continues, all those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners and people need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook."

The content per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platforms than the platforms that are being replaced. And we've talked about going from 2 million per shipset to 4 million per shipset. So even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales, in any case. So I think aerospace side, as Greg said, a very high level of confidence. We don't have to go out and compete those every day, again, for the 2020 skyline. It's more the commercial businesses."

Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook, and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth targets that we laid out ba",499,"Okay. Thank you, Carrie. Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook, and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth targets that we laid out back in March of this year. As I've told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of underpromise and overdeliver is our goal again.
And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance: Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also, of course, raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60. And we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low-growth and volatile macro environment.
I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through the details, but 4 key takeaways from today. First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours with 4 operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.
Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnerships with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.
Third, we're also, of course, seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts, and we remain focused on cost reduction -- structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter, and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.
Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize shareowner value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from '15 through '17. And we recently announced 2 strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan, and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello, which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers, just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.
These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing on our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results, and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?"

Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong, and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3%-plus we would all like to see. During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat, as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC.
Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.
In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices, particularly in the Tier 1 cities, show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3%, principally driven by China, where consistent with our expectations, we saw sales at Otis decline 7%, while CCS sales in China were down 2%.
Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid-single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8%, driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where, as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year; and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 nacelle retrofit program is now complete.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3. Just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China, where orders were down 14% on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis, however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3%, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA, in both cases off tough compares.
Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration, which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid-single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC, entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single digit with mid-single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.
Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20%, driven primarily by the V2500.
Moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year, as 1 point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by 1 point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71, which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items. As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control, and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings, as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list, and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.
Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investment at Pratt & Whitney.
As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15, and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.
There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through. But as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segments. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.
Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit: one, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar; and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.
With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail."
159230,371818519,1012783,"United Technologies Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on Page 5.

Also note, we've included an appendix on Page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings. New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we have seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter. Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better-than-expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better-than-expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.
On the next page, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 1% at constant currency, with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was -- that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.
As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix. But to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss, midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season, but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential, it was the best June we have seen in about 7 years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continue to put pressure on the container business, which was down 39%.
Despite a softer top line, CCS continued to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continued to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected, with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.
Turning to aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20%, including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both prebuy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about 9 years old, and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity. And we continue to see RPM growth.
In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016. For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets.
Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop-through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.
We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements and the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid-single digit. Drop-through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower-than-expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up, and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.
At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms, partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program.
Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates, and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations, an improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

But as Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro environment, and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020. We feel very confident about that plan.
For the meantime, though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less, investing in innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation, and most importantly, we're going to focus on executing on the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made in all of our businesses, we continue to be set up for above-GDP growth well into the future.

Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right? We had last year's significant major projects at higher value per unit, and this year, that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of that delta, which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not really -- I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin in the backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is, through greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions from suppliers, and that's what they will do."

Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there is no mandatory requirement for us to fund the domestic pension plan. We will evaluate it as part of our normal cash utilization capital deployment plans and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it. The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially, with keeping the savings impact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side. But again, that's small and doesn't pay out in 1 year. It generally pays out over a couple of years. And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's -- as Greg has mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side to buffer stock, and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multiyear effort as we get our suppliers to performing in gold levels, which are very high standards, by the way, right?

And as I've said before, we were going to invest -- we have invested about $10 billion in CapEx and R&D over the last dozen years or so to bring the products to market. The good news is at the end of the year, we should have all of the aircraft engines certified. We'll get Irkut, we'll get MRJ, we'll get Embraer. So the big phase of investment is really -- will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn down. At the same time, you should know we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over the next 10 years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin out of all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018, and it will stay about that level. As -- even though production rates will increase, costs will come down. But that is a significant investment. The good news, of course, is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there in that 6-, 7-, 8-year time frame, the engines do need to be overhauled, we will see the returns. But this is not a short-term game. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected, which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either. As you know, Howard, in the -- we're in for the long term. We've got great engines. The performance has been phenomenal out of the box. Right now, our focus is just on delivering engines and then servicing them for the next 25 or 30 years."

I didn't necessarily say it was hugely weaker than expected. It was -- the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side, which were down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability.

That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next 2 quarters. That's up from about 36 engines, I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half.

Those were offset -- so $175 million of good news, offset by $70 million of negative engine margin; $50 million on the military mix issue that we have talked about before, F117 principally and others; another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D; and then the rest, about $50-plus million on Pratt Canada OE shipment reduction and the ramp-up costs that we've talked about.

And Bob and the team are all over this, and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time, with the software drops, have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are behind us.

As you mentioned, with the 4 segments, I would tell you I've got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind, 200 GTF this year, then 400, then 800. We're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-Series, MRJ. All of those things give us very high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt. And similarly at UTAS, or at the Aerospace Systems group, they've got line of sight probably to 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period. The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%. But we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new products. We're spending money on digital in the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now again, we assume the world is going to grow at 3%, not 2%. And if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these new products, we could be in that 4% or 5% range as we move towards '17, '18. But clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, urbanization trends continue, the growth of the middle class continues, all those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners and people need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook."

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment.

You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times. 
So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76. That's up 5% year-over-year and $14.4 billion of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the Aerospace units. So [indiscernible] adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth. 
With 3 strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10. That's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom in last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion. We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals. 
Once again, we had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the Aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income with strong cash generation at each of our business units. These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation and, of course, innovation. 
And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well in the field. We now have 8 operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe. As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours in more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets. 
VivaAerobus , which is a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance. 
The good news is, of course, the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity. We're improving yields and perfecting processes. 
We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market which is down more than 5%. I would remind you, though, that pricing pressure remains intense. So despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come. 
We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies I fully discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend, and we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. There is always more to do at Otis and across UTC. We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our overall SG&A rate, which hit 9.7% of sales, remains the lowest in the peer group. 
On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion in cash to share owners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployments will consistently grow share and value for the long term. 
Okay, let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on Slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line with what we had planned for the year. 
While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets. In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K. Middle East projects remain under pressure, as you would expect. But Asia, excluding China, continues to see robust growth. 
Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which is up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%. For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China. 
Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their sixth [ph] consecutive year of profitability and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space where we have great content. In the third quarter, our Aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that is partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter. 
With that, let me turn you over to Akhil to take you through the details."
159230,403765139,1059908,"United Technologies Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Before I start, just a quick note. I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC.

I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently Vice President at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC. 
Moving to Slide 3. Total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by 1 point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items. As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt largely offset by benefit from the inclusion of a tax settlement. As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year. We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With 3 quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney where we expect full year earnings to be between $1,715,000,000 and $1,775,000,000. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by higher E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transactional aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin. 
We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017 and we'll give specific guidance later. However, there are 2 points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017, about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines. 
But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margin through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and European business will grow and net commercial aftermarket will increase. However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter. We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017, net of higher interest expense, and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017. 
As we have consistently said, our Aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year after year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term. With that, let me go to the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. 
Turning to Otis on Slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. In the quarter, Otis sales was $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contribution from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments and the absence of prior year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments. Foreign exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were down 2%, driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new corporate sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015. Service sales were up 3% with continued solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly. New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia, outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits, while orders in North America were up slightly even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year, in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. So with 3 quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million. 
On Slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year-over-year. North America residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digits. CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS. Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and the declining North America truck-related refrigeration market after several euros of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high-single digit growth the prior year. Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously. 
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by a year-over-year increase in large and to deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistics center. Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models. Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada oe drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million. 
At Aerospace Systems, on Slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment which was up 17% off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next-generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. The military business was down 6%. The low teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of the C-5 and the retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a noncore asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior years' contract adjustments and license agreements. With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg."

And while we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp-up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt military businesses continue to perform well. We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS, all of these guys picking up the slack. In the, balance still works at UTC. I'm very confident both our updated guidance of $6.55 to $6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We got a growing aero backlog and we continue to invest in all of our businesses, and the entire organization remains focused on our 4 key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. We've got a great portfolio of 4 franchises of global scale and resilient business models, and all these businesses are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization of middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to create significant shareholder value.

We've been talking about this kind of $1 billion peak of negative engine margin in 2018. And clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly even from this year's levels. So as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there. I think once we start delivering on a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to in terms of deliveries. But it's going to get fixed and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better. And so I think I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is, they love this engine, they love the takeoff power, they love the noise and it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track. As far as the portfolio, we will always look at what's best for our shareholders over the long term. I would tell you right now keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the Aerospace side with some of the -- the good news out of the commercial is certainly helpful, but our portfolio is something that we look at.

Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 to 105 days. That is from the time we started to the time we got all the way through the test process which is taking more than 3 months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is up from the number of units or fan blades that are coming out at the end of the process that were acceptable it was about 30%. Today, that 100 to 105 days is down to 55 days of lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories. We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team's done a great job. This is a brand-new -- as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there. I think 2 things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity. With our partners, IHI, will be coming out online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January. We're also standing up a brand-new factory about 4 miles away from the current factory in Lansing which will be mostly automated processes. That will start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year. Again, to put this in perspective, this is the first time ever build one of this titanium aluminum plate and this is a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that follow the company a long time, you'll remember, we had the same issue when we built a hollow titanium fan blade for the PW 4000. And we had the same yield issues, we had the simple producibility issues. And today, it's not an issue at all. We stamped about on a regular basis but we still makes them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top, we're following the production yields, I hate to say this, a daily basis but we're following it, and I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made."

So I would think we have the right processes in place in the supply chain to ensure we've got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at our supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got 2 key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF.

Right now as we look at Pratt, we want to be very specific. Those $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned. So a $400 million headwind, it's just hard to see, even with a better aftermarket next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be down. E&D I think is the other challenge at Pratt where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all of these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see and so probably 2018 and 2019 is E&D. As far as overall UTC, again, this is -- we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the details of the plans from all of the units and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin -- negative engine margin and the big pension headwind that we have. And I think that's why, as we look at it today, it's hard to paint a picture where we can see earnings growth at UTC next year."

But clearly, with the aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin in the mix at UTAS, but those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket as well as growth on the commercial side. Keep in mind the Otis side we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. The LEAP has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis, top line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line. And from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've just laid out. All of those things will start to pay off in '18 and '19. So again, try to surprise anybody with the '17 outlook but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook."

So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs clearly, but that will benefit from us coming down the cost curve. But the fact, which you may not be thinking about, is the CEO engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from '17 to '18 as will be the GP 7000s, and both of those carry negative engines margins as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down and that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine -- incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range. On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or 2 more as we ramp up as we take the engine production up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement at the supply chain stabilize at inventory turns. But in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that, as there will be demand on CapEx for another year or 2, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more. The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet the production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean 90% or close thereabouts this year about 100% last year in the face of these investment is not a bad number."

Obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting. The weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs left in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track. I think, more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S. Average life is somewhere between 10 and 15 years depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment, and that is again the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004, 2005 when we were selling the market was 7.5 million units a year, those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged. I think it's a really good place. We got great products, very high efficiency systems and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there. As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte has been focused on it. I'm reminded since we've acquired Goodridge back in 2012, 4 years ago, we've realized about $600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There is still more factory consolidations to come. I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities and there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce costs in the very competitive markets that we are, probably no more big plant closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already. And the same is true on Otis. I think they're consolidating their engineering footprint at 3 major engineering centers for over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network and there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally. So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. We've done a heck of a job over the last 6 or 7 years taking overhead cost out of their SG&A is like 5%. So right now for Pratt, it's about adding capacity, but we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere from the corporate office to the aftermarket to the supply chain."

So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single-digit, and this quarter felt like that. There were some benefit in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of 1 point or so. So I think I would say very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low single-digit growth at UTAS and we'd still be comfortable with that. On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V 2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are 2 factors driving it. One is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 and select 5 engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about 8 years and 50% of those engines have not come for overall, so they are starting to come into the shops now which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think, overall, I would say it's sort of a normal what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket."

Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start to try to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We got $1.7 billion off the books, but I would just say, there is more to come. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize and the plant to try and avoid some the pressure interest rates to put on us. And interest rate is not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities also at cost. So we've got a long way to go on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see -- we should see growth at CCS.

We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the market continues to be relatively robust especially in that Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio but it's, obviously, most acute in China. U.S., I think we're doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough and I think we're continuing to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter. So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness that we see, the cancellation rates come down. And we also improve productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do with Otis. It's not just about pricing. There's some structural things we need to do, but I think Philip and the team are on the right track."

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment.

You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times. 
So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76. That's up 5% year-over-year and $14.4 billion of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the Aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth. 
With 3 strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10. That's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom in last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion. We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals. 
Once again, we had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the Aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income with strong cash generation at each of our business units. These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation and, of course, innovation. 
And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well in the field. We now have 8 operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe. As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours in more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets. 
VivaAerobus , which is a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance. 
The good news is, of course, the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity. We're improving yields and perfecting processes. 
We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market which is down more than 5%. I would remind you, though, that pricing pressure remains intense. So despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come. 
We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies I fully discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend, and we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. There is always more to do at Otis and across UTC. We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our overall SG&A rate, which hit 9.7% of sales, remains the lowest in the peer group. 
On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion in cash to share owners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployments will consistently grow share and value for the long term. 
Okay, let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on Slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line with what we had planned for the year. 
While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets. In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K. Middle East projects remain under pressure, as you would expect. But Asia, excluding China, continues to see robust growth. 
Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which is up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%. For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China. 
Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their sixth consecutive year of profitability and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space where we have great content. In the third quarter, our Aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that is partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter. 
With that, let me turn you over to Akhil to take you through the details."
159230,403765139,1060265,"United Technologies Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC. 
Moving to Slide 3. Total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by one point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items. As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. 
As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the Aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year. 
We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With 3 quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full year earnings to be between $1,715,000,000 and $1,775,000,000. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by high E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transactional aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin. 
We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017, and we'll give specific guidance later. However, there are 2 points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements, at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017, about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines. 
But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margin through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow, and net commercial aftermarket will increase. However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. 
We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter. We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017, net of higher interest expense, and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017. 
As we have consistently said, our Aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year after year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term. 
With that, let me go to the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on Slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency, as we usually do, and as a reminder, there is an appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. 
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments and the absence of prior year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments. Foreign exchange translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. 
New equipment sales were down 2%, driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new equipment sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015. Service sales were up 3% with continued solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly. 
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia, outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year, in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. 
So with 3 quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million. 
On Slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year-over-year. North America residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit. 
CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS. 
Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and the declining North America truck-related refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high single digit growth the prior year. Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. 
For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously. 
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistics center. Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. 
Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models. 
Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada, OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million. 
At Aerospace Systems, on Slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment, which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next-generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. 
The military business was down 6%. The low teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs. 
Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost-reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a noncore asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. 
With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg."

So overall, very good performance in the quarter and a strong year so far. And while we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp-up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt military businesses continue to perform well. We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS, all of these guys picking up the slack. In the end, balance still works at UTC. 
I'm very confident of both our updated guidance of $6.55 to $6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We got a growing Aero backlog, and we continue to invest in all of our businesses. And the entire organization remains focused on our 4 key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. We've got a great portfolio of 4 franchises of global scale and resilient business models, and all these businesses are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization and middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to create significant share owner value. 
With that, let me go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?"

Let me just -- let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of $1 billion peak of negative engine margin in 2018, and clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly even from this year's levels. So as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there. I think once we start delivering on a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries. But it's going to get fixed, and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better. And so I think I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is, they love this engine, they love the takeoff power, they love the noise and it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track. As far as the portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the share owners over the long term. I would tell you right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the Aerospace side with some of the -- the good news out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're significantly -- we're trading significantly below intrinsic value, as I'm sure you guys know. It's a little frustrating, but it's okay. It's a long-term story here."

Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 to 105 days. That is from the time we started it to the time we got all the way through the test process. It was taking more than 3 months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out at the end of the process that were acceptable, that was about 30%. Today, that 100 to 105 days is down to 55 days of lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories. We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team's done a great job. This is a brand new -- as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there. I think 2 things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity, where our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January. We're also standing up a brand-new factory about 4 miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That'll start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year. You need -- again, to put this in perspective, this is the first time anyone has ever built one of this ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that follow the company a long time, you'll remember, we had the same issue when we built a hollow titanium fan blade for the PW 4000. And we had the same yield issues, we had the same producibility issues, and today, it's not an issue at all. We stamped them out, I won't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top on this. We're following production yields on, I hate to say this, a daily basis but we're following it, and I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made."

It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at the supplier, we're going to be just fine.

I would tell you, Cai, we're on track for what we've laid out for the 2020 goals, which would show profitability starting to improve in 2018 and 2019. And as you know, the first aftermarket or first big overhaul is, on the GTF, around 2020. So this -- we expect earnings growth to pick up in 2018. We're not going to give you a number here. But clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin in the mix at UTAS. But those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket as well as growth on the commercial side. Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. The LEAP has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis, top line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line, and from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out. All of those things would start to pay off in '18 and '19. So again, trying not to surprise anybody with the '17 outlook, but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook."

So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that -- they will benefit from the -- us coming down the cost curve. But the fact, which you may not be thinking about, is that the CEO [ph] engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from '17 to '18 as will be the GP7000s, and both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down, and that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine -- incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range. On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or 2 more as we ramp up as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns. But in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as will there be demand on CapEx for another year or 2, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more. The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet the production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean, 90% or close, thereabouts, this year, about 100% last year in face of these investment is not a bad number."

Obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting. The weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs left in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong, about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track. I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S. Average life is somewhere between 10 and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is again the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004, 2005 when we were selling -- the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged. I think it's a really -- we're in a very good place. We got great products, very high efficiency systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there. As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. And I'm reminded here, since we've acquired Goodrich back in 2012, 4 years ago, we've realized about $600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There is still more factory consolidations to come. I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce costs in the very competitive markets that we are, probably no more big plant closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already. And the same is true on Otis. There's -- I think they're consolidating their engineering footprint to 3 major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network, and there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally. So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. We've done a heck of a job over the last 6 or 7 years taking overhead cost out of their SG&A. It's like 5%. So right now it's -- for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere from the corporate office to the aftermarket to the supply chain."

We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single-digit, and this quarter felt like that. There were some benefit in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low single-digit growth at UTAS, and we'd still feel comfortable with that. On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are 2 factors driving it. One is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 and SelectFive [ph] engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about 8 years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overall, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket."

I would say even though the data is not quite there from industry overall, but given the strength we have been seeing in our orders in Americas, we've been doing extremely well there and I would venture that we are gaining significant share in Americas. And then in Europe, the order rates of up 21% this quarter would suggest that, again, we're probably doing better than market. So net-net, the initiatives that Philippe has laid out, particularly on the new equipment side, are starting to show up this year."

I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China. We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the market continues to be relatively robust, especially in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio but it's, obviously, most acute in China. U.S., I think we get -- we're doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think that we're continuing to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter. So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness that we see, the cancellation rates come down and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do with Otis. It's not just about pricing. There's some structural things we need to do, but I think Philippe and team are on the right track."

You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times. 
So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76. That's up 5% year-over-year and $14.4 billion of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the Aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth. 
With 3 strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10. That's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom in last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion. We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals. 
Once again, we had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the Aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income with strong cash generation at each of our business units. These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation and, of course, innovation. 
And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well in the field. We now have 8 operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe. As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours in more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets. 
VivaAerobus, which is a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance. 
The good news is, of course, the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity. We're improving yields and perfecting processes. 
We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market which is down more than 5%. I would remind you, though, that pricing pressure remains intense. So despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come. 
We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend, and we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always more to do at Otis and across UTC. We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our overall SG&A rate, which hit 9.7% of sales, remains the lowest in the peer group. 
On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion in cash to share owners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployments will consistently grow share owner value for the long term. 
Okay, let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on Slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line with what we had planned for the year. 
While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets. In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K. Middle East projects remain under pressure, as you would expect. But Asia, excluding China, continues to see robust growth. 
Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which is up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%. For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China. 
Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their sixth consecutive year of profitability and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space where we have great content. In the third quarter, our Aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that is partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter. 
With that, let me turn you over to Akhil to take you through the details."
159230,403765139,1060378,"United Technologies Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC. 
Moving to Slide 3. Total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by one point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items. As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. 
As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the Aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year. 
We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With 3 quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full year earnings to be between $1,715,000,000 and $1,775,000,000. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by high E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transactional aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin. 
We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017, and we'll give specific guidance later. However, there are 2 points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements, at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017, about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines. 
But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margin through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow, and net commercial aftermarket will increase. However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. 
We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter. We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017, net of higher interest expense, and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017. 
As we have consistently said, our Aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year after year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term. 
With that, let me go to the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on Slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency, as we usually do, and as a reminder, there is an appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. 
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments and the absence of prior year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments. Foreign exchange translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. 
New equipment sales were down 2%, driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new equipment sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015. Service sales were up 3% with continued solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly. 
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia, outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year, in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. 
So with 3 quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million. 
On Slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year-over-year. North America residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit. 
CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS. 
Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and the declining North America truck-related refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high single digit growth the prior year. Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. 
For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously. 
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistics center. Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. 
Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models. 
Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada, OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million. 
At Aerospace Systems, on Slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment, which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next-generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. 
The military business was down 6%. The low teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs. 
Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost-reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a noncore asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. 
With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg."

Let me just -- let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of $1 billion peak of negative engine margin in 2018, and clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly even from this year's levels. So as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there. I think once we start delivering on a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries. But it's going to get fixed, and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better. And so I think I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is, they love this engine, they love the takeoff power, they love the noise and it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track. As far as the portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the share owners over the long term. I would tell you right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the Aerospace side with some of the -- the good news out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're significantly -- we're trading significantly below intrinsic value, as I'm sure you guys know. It's a little frustrating, but it's okay. It's a long-term story here."

Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 to 105 days. That is from the time we started it to the time we got all the way through the test process. It was taking more than 3 months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out at the end of the process that were acceptable, that was about 30%. Today, that 100 to 105 days is down to 55 days of lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories. We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team's done a great job. This is a brand new -- as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there. I think 2 things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity, one of our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January. We're also standing up a brand-new factory about 4 miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That'll start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year. You need -- again, to put this in perspective, this is the first time anyone has ever built one of this ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that have been following the company a long time, you'll remember, we had the same issue when we built a hollow titanium fan blade for the PW 4000. And we had the same yield issues, we had the same producibility issues, and today, it's not an issue at all. We stamped them out, I won't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top on this. We're following production yields on, I hate to say this, a daily basis but we're following it, and I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made."

So I would think we have the right processes in place to -- in the supply chain to ensure we got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at the supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got 2 key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF. I also talked about -- we have added the capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be leading operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as head of operations.

So we actually expect them to be down. E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all of these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019, is E&D. As far as overall UTC, again, this is -- we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the detail of the plans from all of the units, and there's a lot of moving pieces.

So on the first one, the math for 2018 is -- there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that -- they will benefit from the -- us coming down the cost curve. But the fact, which you may not be thinking about,",325,"Great questions, Jeff. So on the first one, the math for 2018 is -- there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that -- they will benefit from the -- us coming down the cost curve. But the fact, which you may not be thinking about, is that the CEO [ph] engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from '17 to '18 as will be the GP7000s, and both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down, and that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine -- incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range. On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or 2 more as we ramp up as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns. But in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as will there be demand on CapEx for another year or 2, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more. The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet the production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean, 90% or close, thereabouts, this year, about 100% last year in face of these investment is not a bad number."

Obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting. The weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs left in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong, about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track. I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S. Average life is somewhere between 10 and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is again the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004, 2005 when we were selling -- the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged. I think it's a really -- we're in a very good place. We got great products, very high efficiency systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there. As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. And I'm reminded here, since we've acquired Goodrich back in 2012, 4 years ago, we've realized about $600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There is still more factory consolidations to come. I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce costs in the very competitive markets that we are, probably no more big plant closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already. And the same is true on Otis. There's -- I think they're consolidating their engineering footprint to 3 major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network, and there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally. So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. We've done a heck of a job over the last 6 or 7 years taking overhead cost out of their SG&A. It's like 5%. So right now it's -- for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere from the corporate office to the aftermarket to the supply chain."

So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with normal -- with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single-digit, and this quarter felt like that. There were some benefit in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low single-digit growth at UTAS, and we'd still feel comfortable with that. On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are 2 factors driving it. One is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 and SelectFive [ph] engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about 8 years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overall, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket."

The other headwind, the pension headwind is real but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start to trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We got $1.7 billion off the books, but I would -- as I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the planned -- to try and avoid some of the pressure that interest rates put on us. And interest rate, it's not just pension.

I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China. We've been talking about that.

Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think that we're continuing to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter. So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness that we see, the cancellation rates come down and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce.

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment.

You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times. 
So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76. That's up 5% year-over-year and $14.4 billion of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the Aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth. 
With 3 strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10. That's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom in last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion. We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals. 
Once again, we had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the Aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income with strong cash generation at each of our business units. These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation and, of course, innovation. 
And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well in the field. We now have 8 operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe. As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours in more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets. 
VivaAerobus, which is a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance. 
The good news is, of course, the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity. We're improving yields and perfecting processes. 
We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market which is down more than 5%. I would remind you, though, that pricing pressure remains intense. So despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come. 
We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend, and we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always more to do at Otis and across UTC. We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than in our overall SG&A rate, which hit 9.7% of sales, remains the lowest in the peer group. 
On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion in cash to share owners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployments will consistently grow share owner value for the long term. 
Okay, let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on Slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line with what we had planned for the year. 
While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets. In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K. Middle East projects remain under pressure, as you would expect. But Asia, excluding China, continues to see robust growth. 
Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas, driven by Otis, which is up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%. For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China. 
Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their sixth consecutive year of profitability and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space where we have great content. In the third quarter, our Aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that is partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter. 
With that, let me turn you over to Akhil to take you through the details."
159230,403765139,1060733,"United Technologies Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","RTX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC. 
Moving to Slide 3. Total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by one point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items. As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. 
As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the Aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year. 
We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With 3 quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full year earnings to be between $1,715,000,000 and $1,775,000,000. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by high E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transactional aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin. 
We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017, and we'll give specific guidance later. However, there are 2 points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements, at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017, about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines. 
But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margin through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow, and net commercial aftermarket will increase. However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. 
We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter. We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017, net of higher interest expense, and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017. 
As we have consistently said, our Aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year after year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term. 
With that, let me go to the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on Slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency, as we usually do, and as a reminder, there is an appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. 
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments and the absence of prior year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments. Foreign exchange translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. 
New equipment sales were down 2%, driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new equipment sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015. Service sales were up 3% with continued solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly. 
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia, outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year, in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. 
So with 3 quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million. 
On Slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a one point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year-over-year. North America residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit. 
CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS. 
Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and the declining North America truck-related refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high single digit growth the prior year. Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. 
For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously. 
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistics center. Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. 
Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models. 
Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada, OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million. 
At Aerospace Systems, on Slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment, which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next-generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. 
The military business was down 6%. The low teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs. 
Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost-reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a noncore asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. 
With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Greg."

Let me just -- let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of $1 billion peak of negative engine margin in 2018, and clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly even from this year's levels. So as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there. I think once we start delivering on a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries. But it's going to get fixed, and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better. And so I think I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology.

Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 to 105 days. That is from the time we started it to the time we got all the way through the test process. It was taking more than 3 months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out at the end of the process that were acceptable, that was about 30%. Today, that 100 to 105 days is down to 55 days of lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories. We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team's done a great job. This is a brand new -- as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there. I think 2 things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity, one of our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January. We're also standing up a brand-new factory about 4 miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That'll start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year. You need -- again, to put this in perspective, this is the first time anyone has ever built one of this ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that have been following the company a long time, you'll remember, we had the same issue when we built a hollow titanium fan blade for the PW 4000. And we had the same yield issues, we had the same producibility issues, and today, it's not an issue at all. We stamped them out, I won't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top on this. We're following production yields on, I hate to say this, a daily basis but we're following it, and I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made."

The pacing item this year is going to be fan blades. There's a couple of other critical parts that we continue to work with the suppliers on, where we have seen yields improving, we've seen added capacity and we're out adding additional capacity to try and make up some of the slack. So I would think we have the right processes in place to -- in the supply chain to ensure we got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at the supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got 2 key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF. I also talked about -- we have added the capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be leading operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as head of operations.

Right now, as we look at Pratt, we want to be very specific. Those $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned, so a $400 million headwind, it's just hard to see -- even with a better aftermarket next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be down. E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all of these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019, is E&D. As far as overall UTC, again, this is -- we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the detail of the plans from all of the units, and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin -- negative engine margin and the big pension headwind that we have.

But clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin in the mix at UTAS. But those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket as well as growth on the commercial side. Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. Philippe has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis, top line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line, and from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out. All of those things would start to pay off in '18 and '19.

So on the first one, the math for 2018 is -- there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that -- they will benefit from the -- us coming down the cost curve. But the fact, which you may not be thinking about, is that the CEO [ph] engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from '17 to '18 as will be the GP7000s, and both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down, and that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine -- incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range. On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or 2 more as we ramp up as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns. But in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as will there be demand on CapEx for another year or 2, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more. The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet the production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean, 90% or close, thereabouts, this year, about 100% last year in face of these investment is not a bad number."

Obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting. The weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs left in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong, about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track. I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S. Average life is somewhere between 10 and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is again the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004, 2005 when we were selling -- the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged. I think it's a really -- we're in a very good place. We got great products, very high efficiency systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there. As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. And I'm reminded here, since we've acquired Goodrich back in 2012, 4 years ago, we've realized about $600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There is still more factory consolidations to come. I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce costs in the very competitive markets that we are, probably no more big plant closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already. And the same is true on Otis. There's -- I think they're consolidating their engineering footprint to 3 major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network, and there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally. So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. We've done a heck of a job over the last 6 or 7 years taking overhead cost out of their SG&A. It's like 5%. So right now it's -- for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere from the corporate office to the aftermarket to the supply chain."

So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with normal -- with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single digit, and this quarter felt like that. There were some benefit in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low single-digit growth at UTAS, and we'd still feel comfortable with that. On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are 2 factors driving it. One is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 and SelectFive [ph] engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about 8 years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overall, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket."

The other headwind, the pension headwind is real but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start to trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We got $1.7 billion off the books, but I would -- as I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the planned -- to try and avoid some of the pressure that interest rates put on us. And interest rate, it's not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities, also at cost. So we've got a long way to go on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see -- we should see growth at CCS.

Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think that we're continuing to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter. So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness that we see, the cancellation rates come down and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce.

The fact is, these fixes that we're talking about in Otis, this is nothing you're going to see come through in the P&L right away. I mean, we -- even if we improve on the new equipment side, we will put those -- it takes us 18 months to install the elevator. We give free service for a year. You're really talking 2 to 3 years out before you really start to see big traction on the new equipment side. Service productivity, it'd be a little bit faster, but again, we're making more investments than we're seeing on the productivity side initially. So a little bit of patience on the Otis side.

All right. Well thank you, everybody, for listening in today. Appreciate that. As always, Akhil and the Investor Relations team will be available all day to answer your calls. I'd ask that you go easy on our new guy Carroll Lane as he comes up to speed, but I'm sure he's looking forward to meeting with each and every one of you. 
So thank you very much, and have a wonderful day. Take care."
