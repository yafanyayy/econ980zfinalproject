In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent and the relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success.

Finally, with Hill's. Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All 3 bands, Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic had foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015
In the U.S, superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and PETCO, which contributed to our solid results. In Europe, our ideal balance sign is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We're seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. And we're very excited about our upcoming innovations.

Juniors in the wellness categories premium priced Hill's Science Diet healthy cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new alginate technology to deliver us appear looking tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with more tasty, tender vegetables and savor results.
So before I wrap up quickly, I want to cover 2 more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million a quarter with the loss of the interest income from Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were $896.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the one-time charge with Venezuela, this number excludes $6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding, assumed issued from the exercise in the money stock options as they're anti dilutive. We'd expect of the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world. Our margin increase and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the breakout also strategy and priorities, thereby, delivering this consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, as is our ongoing funding in both program. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about the many new products and initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our process with you as we go throughout the year.
So Chanel, that's been of our prepared remarks. I should turn that over now to Q&A."

262247,322238631,923681,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in",625,"Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015 as been said with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year, and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in 2 years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in. First of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers are: Then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the longer-term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we want for the future. And then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility this required to deal with events as they unfold. Now if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, in the foreign exchange headwind their asset was in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experience in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer, we think about the brands and the health of our brand and the developing of our market share of our brands. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took conscious decision to take pricing, to help recover gross margin and so far, the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares, whether you look at the value market share and local currency as been a talk specifically to Brazil, or whether you look at of the volume market share in that region, they're up. And so the consumer is staying with us. And the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that the have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess, a couple of things to say and it relates to the gross margin. First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it will be at a lesser level. Second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down. Third, we have our Funding the Growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And on top of that, we had pricing. But we had less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we won't see the balance between those volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down trading, and we are confident about the reversal back to volume more and priced less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business."

So do you think we're going to see negative volume growth maybe for the next quarter or 2, potentially even worse than we just saw in the fourth quarter in Latin America? But then broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you're seeing there, it surprises me that we're seeing a slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get it in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia specifically, China and India, I think you called out -- do you think there's something more structural there? Do you think there's going to take a longer time? Do you really think it's an economic factor that's leading to the slowdown in the growth. If you can talk about that, that will be great."

When you turn to Asia and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in categories is still mid single-digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen anything dramatic in terms of the change in behavior, thus far. We're obviously very focused on that with these, as we would suppose, would be. And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India, as been mentioned with India, are both up nicely in 2016. So we stay close to it.

It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you're taking pricing in. On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get to dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased product to engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital, but also the so-called traditional media. And then of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through the retail level where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected, as we got into our budgeting process, that our innovation flow will be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 and increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the richness of innovation that Bina went through in hair prepared will rise, that is exactly where we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising, the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and of course, on a ratio basis as well, given that strength of innovation."

And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less aggressive foreign exchange headwind.

And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word of balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create in the trial and repeat of our brand, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up and being a went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the school room, so the dental office, the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including television, including magazine, advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't we can over time and I said that the advertising would be up, absolutely, and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat, to various brand, health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to start, shall we say, take more out of the brand than you are putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance. We think we've kept the right balance in 2015 when we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix, and we will monitor very, very closely the trial and repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world because we're a marketing company and that's what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74 share in Brazil, that's how much of the shelf you have, you can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of over proliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one in, one out policy, that would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now within that, you have cycles when you are placing and you got a double count, but it's something we watch, really, at the top of the house and it's a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything, the factory, the inventory. You can imagine all of the touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we are at risk of over proliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year-on-year."

It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not be gross margin.

I guess, for those materials that are dollar denominated, they face the same pressures that we do. And many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say I can't give you a check through in those review on have they mimic the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they stay there, or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation are against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the tough points we have in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of moms today in Latin America are millennials, that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that's a great place to go to talk to those kind of consumers. And I think personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lawrence's point about premium innovation. And it's off that fulcrum, everything else comes. Because otherwise, from an operating point of view, you're only leaving yourself really leverage overhead and appetizing to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses.
Okay. Well, I'm pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 47% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign change-related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter.
As you will hear more detail as I go through the divisions, our market shares around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continuing to do so as we enter 2016. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, and our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong, and working capital is under very good control.
And as you read in this morning's press release, we have taken a decision effective December 31, 2015, to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statement. 
As we've stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations will be about negative $0.10 for the full year, and we'd expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.
So let's turn to the divisions. First, with North America. We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you'd expect, the innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results. 
In the third quarter 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. 
In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are 2x more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015.
Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last read of 2015, thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. 
And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we're launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White, which provides 4 shades visibly whiter teeth in 6 weeks and starts working in just 3 days. Also, we're introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health mineral repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamels. 
To bolster our toothbrush business, we're launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking powered toothbrush featuring kids' favorite licensed character, which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a 2-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing.
Also in the first quarter, Tom's of Maine is launching Tom's Natural Rapid Relief Sensitive Toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid relief and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium-priced. 
Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date, and our year-to-date body wash increased 80 basis points. More innovation this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we're launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes hand washing fun as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye-free, alcohol-free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies. And in body wash, we're launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony, designed to leave skin feeling soft. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioners. In the toothpaste category, we've seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date.
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market share is up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the U.K,, which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up a full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full.
In the toothpaste category, we're introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high-cleaning prophy silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variance in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we're restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste's premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.
In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate 360 degree Expert White Toothbrush plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. 
And in Personal Care, we're relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high-quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch will enchant consumers at point-of-sale.
Also in Personal Care is a Palmolive Skin Garden line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances; natural ingredients rooted in the garden, such as violet and honey, peony, pear and mirabelle plum; sensorial and vivid textures; and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive equity. 
And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well, and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced Shower Oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced Body Balms in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. 
Sanex Men will also be launched, which is the first mass personal care range truly focused on men's skin health. 
As you know, we have a very strong market-leading Home Care business in this region, and an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays, which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces: the oven and microwave, vitroceramic and stainless steel.
So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, shampoos and liquid cleaners. 
In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb, up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4%, with the most recent read at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success.
In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar, increased 70 basis points and is now almost to 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the superpremium category, with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360.
In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the #1 and #2 positions in the region, and we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. 
In the Oral Care whitening category, we have 3 exciting launches. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers 3 shades whiter teeth. A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol-free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in 2 days will both be launched later this year. 
In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefit, see the removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth, and should drive growth for the category.
In Personal Care, under the Protex name, we're launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soap, Protex Pro-Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin is necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing. This innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive Almond and Omega Oil with a nourishing formula. 
In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skincare. 
Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses, greater China and India, and this despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth.
 
In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and the relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total charcoal, with a unique antibacterial formula, which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces, has added market share.
Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis, but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. 
A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than .0.01-millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points, respectively, in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Whitening Pen, and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read.
Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year, with the most recent read at 26.5%. 
And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are 5 variants: tea tree oil gum care, lemon zesty radiating white, jasmine chamomile healthy refreshing, lotus jade green soothing gum and seaweed salt pure wide. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients. 
And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category: Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black with a flexible neck and improved handle and a line of midtier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. 
To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we're launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection.
Then going to Africa/Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. 
Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up a full point from the year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.
In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution played an important role in these results. In Israel, 2 new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2%, with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%.
Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business, and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth, driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points. 
And we have some exciting innovation for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste across the division. This -- the differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breathe freshening technology, ON12 Complex.
Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng with an exclusive Altai herbs and ginseng. 
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding 2 new variants, Feel Good and So Dynamic.
Finally, with Hill's. Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All 3 bands, Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic pet foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and PETCO, which contributed to our solid results. 
In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We're seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. 
And we're very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's available in dry and delicious stew forms and of course, will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population.
Hill's will also be entering the wearable space. Hill's has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary health care with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it's designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis or obesity. 
New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill's Science Diet Healthy Cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new alginate technology to deliver superior-looking, tasty, wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.
So before I wrap up quickly, I want to cover 2 more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million per quarter with the loss of the interest income from Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were $896.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter 2015 due to the onetime charge for Venezuela, this number excludes $6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercise of in-the-money stock options as they're anti-dilutive. We'd expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world. Our gross margin increased, and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities thereby delivering these consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track as is our ongoing funding-the-growth program. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
So Chanel, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn over now to Q&A."

So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macro environment if you're seeing any different behavior versus the past with the macro slowdown we're seeing in Latin America, and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure. And then that's at the consumer level, but at the competitor level, what are you generally seeing from your competitors? Are they following? And can you characterize the competitive environment that you're seeing?"
262247,322238631,923800,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in",619,"Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in 2 years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers; then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the longer term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we want for the future; and then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that's required to deal with events as they unfold. Now if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there, as it was in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brands. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took a conscious decision to take pricing, to help recover gross margin and suffer the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares, whether you look at the value market share in local currency as being a talk to -- specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they're up. So the consumer is staying with us, and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that the have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say, and it relates to the gross margin: First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it'll be at a lesser level; second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down; third, we have our funding-the-growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we had less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing, and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down-trading, and we're confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business."

But then, broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you're seeing there, it surprises me that we're seeing a slowdown in category growth, given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get it in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically, China and India? I think you called out -- do you think there's something more structural there? Do you think there's -- going to take a longer time? Do you really think it's an economic factor that's leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you can talk about that, that would be great."

When you turn to Asia and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in categories is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen anything dramatic in terms of a change in behavior, thus far. We're obviously very focused on that when these -- as you would suppose we would be. And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India, as Bina mentioned with India, are both up nicely in 2015. So we stay close to it.

On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased the product, to engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital, but also the so-called traditional media and then, of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level, where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where he -- we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising -- the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and of course, on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation."

And perhaps, I should take the opportunity now before Lauren comes on and chides me of going through the roll-forward for that fourth quarter gross profit. So if you go to the gross profit in the prior year, it was 58.8%. Pricing, our strongest showing for the year, up 1.6 percentage points, so positive 1.6 points. Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points positive, 2.9%. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, a modest negative with all other, and you get to the 59%. Now as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less-aggressive foreign exchange headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less; but half of it, rollover. We have funding the growth, which you know very well. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016."

And then, on the SKU proliferation or innovation question, do you -- how do you guys -- so every quarter, we hear really interesting things. Bina is basically out of breath describing them at the start of every quarter. How do you guys deal with SKU proliferation? Is there a very clear discipline of put one in, take one out?

And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create a trial and repeat of our brand, build health over time and ultimately, build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the school room to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including television, including magazine advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of the brand than you are putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance. We think we've kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix, and we will monitor very, very closely the trial and repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world because we're a marketing company, and that's what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74% share in Brazil, that's how much of the shelf you have, you can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of overproliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one in, one out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now within that, you have cycles when you're replacing and you've got a double count, but it's something we watch really at the top of the house. And it's a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything, the factory, the inventory. You can imagine all of the touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we're at risk of overproliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year-upon-year."

As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity costs with oil at -- even at $35 are basically flat to modestly down. That's a favorable.

I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say, I can't give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they've stayed there, or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is, against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points we have in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of moms today in Latin America are millennials, that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that's a great place to go to touch those kinds of consumers. And I think, personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lauren's point about premium innovation. And it's off that fulcrum everything else comes. Because otherwise, from an operating point of view, you're only leaving yourself really leverage overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses.
Okay. Well, I'm pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter.
As you will hear in more detail as I go through the divisions, our market shares around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, and our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong, and working capital is under very good control.
And as you read in this morning's press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015, to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements as we stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations will be about negative $0.10 for the full year, and we'd expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.
So let's turn to the divisions. First, with North America. We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you'd expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results. 
In the third quarter 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. 
In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are 2x more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015.
Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last read of 2015 thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. 
And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we're launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White, which provides 4 shades visibly whiter teeth in 6 weeks and starts working in just 3 days. Also, we're introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel. 
To bolster our toothbrush business, we're launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking powered toothbrush featuring kids' favorite licensed characters, which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a 2-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing.
Also in the first quarter, Tom's of Maine is launching Tom's Natural Rapid Relief Sensitive Toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid relief and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium priced. 
Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date, and our year-to-date body wash increased 80 basis points. More innovation this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we're launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes hand washing fun as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye free, alcohol free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies. And in body wash, we're launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony -- designed to leave skin feeling soft. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioners. In the toothpaste category, we've seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date.
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market shares are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the U.K., which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up 1 full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full.
In the toothpaste category, we're introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high-cleaning prophy silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we're restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.
In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate 360 Degree Expert White Toothbrush plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. 
And in Personal Care, we're relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high-quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch will enchant consumers at point of sale.
Also in Personal Care is the Palmolive Skin Garden line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances; natural ingredients rooted in the garden, such as violet and honey, peony, pear and mirabelle plum; sensorial and vivid textures; and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive equity. 
And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well, and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced Shower Oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced Body Balms in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. 
Sanex Men will also be launched, which is the first mass personal care range truly focused on men's skin health. 
As you know, we have a very strong market-leading home care business in this region, and an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays, which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces: the oven and microwave, vitroceramic and stainless steel.
So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, shampoos and liquid cleaners. 
In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb, up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most recent read at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success.
In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar, increased 70 basis points and is now almost to 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the superpremium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360.
In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the #1 and #2 positions in the region, and we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. 
In oral care whitening category, we have 3 exciting launches. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers 3 shades whiter teeth. A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol-free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in 2 days will both be launched later this year. 
In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefit, ""see the removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth"" and should drive growth for the category.
In personal care, under the Protex name, we're launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soap: Protex Pro-Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin, it's necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing. This innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive Almond and Omega Oil with a nourishing formula. 
In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skincare. 
Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses, Greater China and India, and this despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth.
 
In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and the relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal, with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces, has added market share.
Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis, but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. 
A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01-millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points, respectively, in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Whitening Pen, and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read.
Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year with the most recent read at 26.5%. 
And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are 5 variants, Tea Tree Oil Gum Care, Lemon Zesty Radiating White, Jasmine Chamomile Healthy Refreshing, Lotus Jade Green Soothing Gum and Seaweed Salt Pure White. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients. 
And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category: Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black with a flexible neck and improved handle and a line of mid-tier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. 
To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we're launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection.
Then going to Africa/Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. 
Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up 1 full point from the year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.
In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution played an important role in these results. In Israel, 2 new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2% with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%.
Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points. 
And we have some exciting innovation for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste across the division. This -- the differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breath-freshening technology: ON12 Complex.
Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng. 
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding 2 new variants: Feel Good and So Dynamic.
Finally, with Hill's. Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All 3 bands -- Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance -- are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic pet foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and Petco, which contributed to our solid results. 
In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We're seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. 
And we're very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's available in dry and delicious stew forms and, of course, will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population.
Hill's will also be entering the wearable space. Hill's has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary health care with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it's designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis or obesity. 
New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill's Science Diet Healthy Cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new alginate technology to deliver superior-looking tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.
So before I wrap up, quickly, I want to cover 2 more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million per quarter with the loss of the interest income from Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were $896.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter 2015 due to the onetime charge for Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercise of in-the-money stock options as they're anti-dilutive. We'd expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we're extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world. Our gross margin increased, and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby, delivering these consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, as is our ongoing Funding the Growth program. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
So Chanel, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn that over now to Q&A."

But the volume reaction looked more severe than what we've seen traditionally in your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macro environment if you're seeing any different behavior versus the past with the macro slowdown we're seeing in Latin America and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure.

And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in",619,"Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year, and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in 2 years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers; then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the longer term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we want for the future; and then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that's required to deal with events as they unfold. Now if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there, as it was in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brands. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took a conscious decision to take pricing, to help recover gross margin and suffer the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares, whether you look at the value market share in local currency as being a talk to -- specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they're up. So the consumer is staying with us, and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that we have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say, and it relates to the gross margin: First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it'll be at a lesser level; second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down; third, we have our funding-the-growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we had less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing, and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down-trading, and we're confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business."

I get it in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically, China and India, I think you called out? Do you think there's something more structural there? Do you think there's -- going to take a longer time? Do you really think it's an economic factor that's leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you can talk about that, that'd be great."

When you turn to Asia and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in categories is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter.

It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you're taking pricing in. On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased the product, to engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital but also the so-called traditional media and then, of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level, where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected, as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where he -- we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising -- the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and, of course, on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation."

Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points positive, 2.9%. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, a modest negative with all other, and you get to the 59%. Now as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less-aggressive foreign exchange headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less but half of it rollover. We have funding the growth, which you know very well. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016."

And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create a trial and repeat of our brands, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the schoolroom to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including television, including magazine advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of the brand than you were putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance. We think we've kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix, and we will monitor very, very closely the trial-and-repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world because we're a marketing company, and that's what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74% share in Brazil. That's how much of the shelf you have. You can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of overproliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one-in, one-out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now within that, you have cycles when you're replacing and you've got a double count, but it's something we watch really at the top of the house. And it's a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything: the factory, the inventory. You can imagine all of the touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we're at risk of overproliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year-upon-year."

Now of course, that improvement builds over the year. But still, overall, it is less negative. As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity costs with oil at -- even at $35 are basically flat to modestly down. That's a favorable.

The first is a lot more discussion about the local brands and things like that, yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what you've seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint? And then the second question, Ian, is probably it's a little bit of a devil's advocate question and probably not one you're expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you've had over the last 6 to 12 months, wouldn't that argue that, longer term, that the gross margin expansion, which we've been looking for, is less relevant, right. It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the gross margin. So I guess, sort of putting it back into your court in that regard, doesn't the gross margin lose some of its importance over time if you're moving these buckets around more?"

I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say, I can't give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they've stayed there, or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is, against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points we have in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of mums today in Latin America are millennials, that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that's a great place to go to touch those kinds of consumers. And I think, personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lauren's point about premium innovation. And it's off that fulcrum everything else comes. Because otherwise, from an operating point of view, you're only leaving yourself really leverage, overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses. Okay. Well, I'm pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted with our strong start to the year. Organic sales growth is well within our targeted range of 47%. Our gross profit margin reached a long-standing goal of 60%. Advertising as a percent of sales with at a solid 10.6% even with the year-ago quarter, but up 230 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015 behind strong new productivity. 
Currency headwinds continued in the quarter and we were able to take pricing to partially offset those headwinds and still deliver volume growth. And as you will hear as I go through the divisions, our market share are strong and growing. We're well into our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, savings are projected to be within our announced ranges and our funding the growth initiatives have delivered another solid 130 basis points a benefit on the gross margin line in the quarter. 
Current estimates show the benefit from these funding to growth initiative is increasing as we go through the year. Our balance sheet is solid. Working capital is down from the prior year. We announced the dividend increase effective this quarter and our share buyback program continues. 
So then let's turn to the divisions starting with North America. This division reported solid results. Innovation helped to fuel growth and our market shares were up or stable in 8 of all 11 categories. Our new products were well supported with impactful integrated marketing campaigns with activation in-store as well as in traditional media and digital. In 2 space, as mentioned, we've achieved market leadership on the year-to-date basis, up 50 basis points to almost 36% of the market. And you may recall that we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter, we launched a companion mouthwash, which allowed us to offer a regime approached it would supported by shelf displays in-store. As a result, Colgate Total toothpaste achieved its highest first quarter shares in 2013. 
We continue to expand our line of Colgate Optic White whitening toothpaste with the launch of High Impact White. Priced in premium price point, this innovation offers 4 shades visibly whiter teeth by brushing twice daily for 6 weeks. Part of our integrated marketing campaign associated with the launch was sponsorship of the 2016 Country Music Awards, with displays in the presenter holding room as well as a Colgate Optic White hair and makeup room. The Colgate Optic White line now has 6 variance, all premium or over premium priced, holds a record 6% market share year-to-date. 
Also in the first quarter, we launched Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste, which helps repair weakened enamel with vital minerals. The launch was supported by Smile With Strength campaign, one of the strongest testing campaigns ever for the enamel health range. And in addition, we provided strong support to the dental professionals with extensive sampling, print ads and dental journals, conventions, education and detailing. We continue to widen our lead in the manual toothbrush category. A significant contributor has been our line of Colgate 360-degree toothbrushes. The most recent introduction was Colgate 360-degree Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush, a differentiated and incremental innovation, which brought the 360 franchise share to a record 23% year-to-date. 
Our body wash shares are up 50 basis points year-to-date to 9.5%. Contributing to this success is our new line of Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, formulated to leave the skin feeling soft after showering. And in early weeks, it is exceeding our performance expectations. From then, we launched Irish Spring Signature for Men Clean and Scrub Exfoliating body wash, crafted with authentic extract as well as the classic Irish Spring Scent in a convenient pump. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Results were solid in this division as well. A very full innovation grid fueld volume and market share growth. Market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, deodorants and fabric conditioners. Our toothbrush share across Europe increased 40 basis points, increasing our market-leading position. 
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we extended our #1 position by 170 basis points year-to-date and in fabric conditioner by 150 basis points year-to-date. In toothpaste, our first quarter launch of Colgate Total Deep Clean has helped drive share. To build on the success of the Colgate Total line, we also launched Colgate Total Proof with Color Change Technology so you can see it working. 
In the Sensitivity segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Extra Strength toothpaste, which stops sensitivity pain instantly by repairing the open channels to sensitive tooth nerves and strengthens to protective layer while strengthening the teeth. And under the Elmex brand, we're launching Elmex Repair and Preventive toothpaste, which prepare sensitive areas of teeth to prevent further sensitivity. 
Now we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Expert White Toothbrush plus Built-in Whitening Pen. This launch is off to a very strong start. In the second month of launch, we reached almost a 20% share in France and almost 15% in Belgium. So this quarter, we're taking the device plus chemistry format into the Sensitivity segment with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief toothbrush plus Built-in Sensitivity Pen. This provides instant and long-lasting sensitivity relief with the targeted application. Simply brush, treat and go. 
As with Oral Care, Personal care your product pipeline has been full and has helped increase our share in body wash, soaps and deodorants. We told you last quarter about a very exacting premium price line, Palmolive Skin Garden. This regimen approach offering of body wash, bath soap, liquid hand soap and bar soap has met with good early success. 
Our Sanex innovation, Sanex Advanced Shower Oils and Body Balms, are also driving results. In France, for example, our Sanex body wash share is at 10.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 full points from the year-ago period and a leading brand in the market. 
To keep up momentum this quarter, we're launching Sanex Soft Freshness underarm protection, filling an important portfolio gap. Freshness is among the top consumer expectations in the category and is highly incremental to our portfolio with the unique formula that slowly releases pleasant fragrances. 
And in fabric conditioner, we're very excited about our new line of soup cleaning Complete Care which we expect to further drive our leading share position. At a super premium price, this new product employs innovative technology to deliver 3 sought-after benefits: Irresistible softness, antipeeling and color protection. The bottle design has have outstanding on-shelf impact and we expect to launch to receive unprecedented support in this category. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business in Latin America remains strong despite macroeconomic challenges in some of our larger markets. Market shares increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, shampoo, bar soaps and liquid cleaners. Our regional toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to almost 76% year-to-date. In Brazil, our share climbed to 160 basis points to 73.3% year-to-date, driven by our base businesses such as anti-cavity and Colgate Triple Action as well as our premium priced Sensitivity business. Our regional manual toothbrush share was up 50 basis points to 41.5% year-to-date. Our regional mouthwash share increased 50 basis points as well to 31.2% year-to-date. 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile all performed well in mouthwash. Brazil shares increased 150 basis points to 34.5%, due to the very successful launch of Plax Ice Infinity. In bar soaps, where our year-to-date share is over 29%, Protex and Palmolive continue to be the #1 in 2 brands across Latin America. Year-to-date, we've reached record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. In Mexico, innovations such as Palmolive Almond and Omega-3 oil supported by impactful shopper marketing program continues to drive demand. 
And we're excited about the upcoming innovation grid for this quarter in Oral Care, we'll be launching a complete regimen behind Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief. Toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and mouthwash. And we will offer new improved graphics across the line. 
In the Kid segment, we're launching Colgate Smiles Minions toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash with the characters kids love. The introduction was timed with the release of the Minions Movie across the region. And it continue the momentum in fabric conditioner, we're launching superior care. Consumers in this region feel that they're constantly washing clothes, making them look worn out too quickly. But this new product conditions each individual fiber to reduce wear out and extend the life of one's close. It will be available in our traditional fragrance as well as a new unique and sweet vanilla one. 
Turning then to Asia. Business is solid in this region. While overall leadership regional shares in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes have started the year a bit soft, countries showed good results. As referenced in the earnings release, toothpaste shares increased in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and Pakistan. Our manual toothbrush share in India is up 220 basis points to a market-leading 45.7% year-to-date, due in part to innovation in the black bristle segment.  Innovation launched late in the first quarter and coming in the second quarter should help drive results going forward. 
In India, we have just launched Colgate Pain Out. Tooth pain is one of the most common dental problems for Indian consumers and heretofore, there was no targeted solution for the pain, which can come with no warning. Colgate Pain Out is a targeted spot-based application gel that provides express relief from tooth pain. It's been launched in pharmacies across the country and is met with a very good early success while helping to build Colgate therapeutic equity in the pharmacy channel. 
The Natural segment in India has been growing rapidly. And to capitalize on this, we're revitalizing our Colgate Active Salt toothpaste bundle. This comes in 3 variants: Original, with lemon and neem. And also in this segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Clove Essence Toothpaste which provides long-lasting relief and sensitivity with a natural essence of clove. For children in India ages 2 to 5, we're introducing a line of toothpaste, which, are mild and safe and have flavor kids love, strawberry and bubble fruit. 
In China, we are relaunching with you where ethics and packaging across the toothpaste product portfolio. Colgate 360 degrees, which reduces bacteria for 360-degree healthcare mouth, Colgate Max Fresh with the 3 times freshness shockwave and Colgate Power White with a wide range of flavor offerings: Dazzling mint, mint, lemon mineral salt, bamboo charcoal min and jasmine white teeth. In that toothbrush category in India, we just introduced the Colgate A-1 toothbrush. Now as you know, this country have over 1.3 billion people. We have a large opportunity to increase penetration and consumption in the lower income segment. These consumers believe that a toothbrush with a broad yet compact head and dense bristles not only cleans effectively but is also durable and longer-lasting. 
Colgate A1 meets this need and is priced at an affordable value price point. So this should help us continue to grow our leading manual toothbrush market share. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales growth in this region was strong and given the 17% currency headwind, the growth came largely from price as we needed to take significant pricing in certain markets. However, in certain markets such as Russia, we achieved both pricing and volume growth. Innovation has been instrumental in driving our results and there's more to come. In the toothpaste whitening category, we're launching Colgate Optic White Lasting White. Its clinically proven white seal technology makes teeth one share white in 1 week, while preventing stains and fills out even tough stains from food and drink. 
Across Africa, we're introducing a second tier of pricing for the premium Colgate Optic White line within impactful cracked ice packaging. In the manual toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Developed for the consumer with sensitivity, the brush has ultrasoft bristles and small that provide gentle mouth feel and an ultracompact head that easily navigates in the mouth. 
And in the deodorant category in Russia where we have a solid business, we just launched Lady Speed Stick Bioprotection in March. This line effectively protects against sweat and odor while also caring for your skin health. The product contains a biocontrol complex clinically proven to provide protection while keeping your skin healthy without irritation. And as you would expect, it's being supported by in-store shopper support, which should drive good results. 
Finally turning to Hill's. Hill's continues to deliver well-balanced mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Business is good domestically and overseas, both in the therapeutic and wellness categories. In the Hill's Prescription Diet line, Metabolic Plus continues to perform well. First launched a year ago, it's now sold in 42 countries. The offering of a complete range of dry food and stew have been supported by extensive sampling and in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools. And as a result, sales of this product in the first quarter were almost 30% ahead of our expectations. 
Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight is also meeting with success. In the first quarter, we added Perfect Weight Wet in stew form to the existing dry line. As you may recall, this innovation is breakthrough nutrition formulated to help dogs achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 
Another first quarter production was Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which offered our new Alginate Technology in our wellness line to deliver superior looking tasty wet food. This innovation is consistent with the trend of the humanization in pet food and the launch was supported by NCAP placements in some of the pet superstores, at shelf signage, on-pack stickers, sampling in-store and online support and digital media. 
Launching this quarter, our Hill's Prescription Diet Mobility Treat, great tasting treats that support veterinarians' nutritional recommendation and management of mobility issues. These are baked treats such as a pet parent would make at home and form part of an effective nutritional regimen for dogs eating our Hill's perception diet Metabolic Plus Mobility or Prescription Diet JD Therapeutic pet food. 
So in summary, we're delighted with our strong started to the year, building on the momentum with that which we exited 2015. And as you've heard, we delivered robust organic sales growth, good gross profit margin growth and solid advertising support behind a full range of new products across categories. Our consistent strategies, which you all know well, have yet again stood us in good stead. Colgate people around the world, as always, are working hard to deliver encouraging results. So we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go through the balance of the year. 
And Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to you to start the Q&A session."

I frankly would start by reiterating what Bina said that we are pleased, as you amplified, Jason, with the start to the year. We think it does reflect constancy of strategy and constancy of execution. And pleasingly, the first quarter arrived pretty much as I think we had described to you it would when we were last on the call, which is to say that our top line would grow between 4% and 7% organically, excluding Venezuela. Around 5% was entirely consistent with the fourth quarter. We said that we expected our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points and w are very pleased with the 110. And with the increased advertising behind the innovation and all of that flowing through to the bottom line. I guess my comment on the gross profit would be, if you look at the shape of our business, gross profit improved across all of our divisions with the exception of Hill's for a known commodity issue. So it is not limited to Latin America. And across Latin America, we took a pretty significant pricing on the back of significant pricing old 2015 to offset further transaction impact, obviously, again, without Venezuela. And we were pleased in Latin America as we suggested might be the case that the volume negative that we saw in the fourth quarter rebounded, I think confirming the fact that although there is always a lead lag, we have good consumer loyalty and adoption even at higher price points. So the way I would frame gross margin is we started at the end of the first quarter saying that our gross margin would with expand 75 to 125 basis points for a host of reasons, part of which was Venezuela, but our funding the growth was an important piece of it as well. And again, 110 is pleasing and as we look forward, I guess, we would say we expect to have gross margin to continue to improve from the first quarter level over the balance of the year and would now say that for the full year, we expect that gross margin to come in towards the high end of our 75 to 125 basis point range, maybe even slightly ahead of that, depending on where transaction headwinds go. We said the last time that we thought gross margin expansion after the planning was an important part of 2016 and clearly that remains in the company. [indiscernible]
[Audio Gap]
prices and does include a little bit of Venezuela. All other 30 basis points. And so the current year gross profit at 60. But I think the important point to make is growth between 4% and 7% excluding Venezuela starting well at 5% and gross profit starting well at 110 basis points. And now saying that we expect to be at the high end of the 75 to 125 range, maybe a little bit more."

I guess, I know we all focus on weekly shares, but I guess, just putting both in a slightly longer-term context. If you take China over the last 8 years, our share has increased from about 30% to 33% when our principal multinational competitor has declined from 24% to about 12%. And in India, if you take the same time period, our market share has increased from about 48% to be near 54% that we start the year with. And similarly, our principal multinational competitor is down from 20% -- 29% to 21%. So we continue to feel very good about the progress over time we are making. In both cases, let's start with India, in both cases, the short-term share impact comes from local competitors with heightened promotional activity that is also the case in China.

Obviously, behind a broad and deep array of innovation that we have coming to our markets around the world starting in the first quarter, but of course, coming for the rest of the year as well. And our current plan would see us increasing our advertising spend year-on-year both absolutely and as a percentage to sales. That is what we said the last time we spoke and we remain in that position. It would not be a Colgate earnings call if I weren't to emphasize the point that we continue to balance this investment behind our brand health and the innovation we have with the very compelling and broad array of in-store activity that we are able to deploy. And so in fact, our commercial investment continues to be up as well in the first quarter, which is to say, the money that we are investing for in-store activity has increased and is on top of the increased ratio of spend on traditional advertising versus the fourth quarter last year. The other thing I would say in terms of efficiency of advertising, because we are seeing it becoming quite a meaningful component of how we go to market a lot more and we spent quite a lot of time showcasing this in CAGNY, for those of you that were there and have read the transcript. A lot about consumer engagement, particularly given the changing demographics in the world, is now with this to advertising. Digital advertising is more efficient than the traditional print, television, radio, billboard type of advertising. And interestingly, to the point in Asia, a significant part of the investment we make these days, indeed approaching 50% in the case of China, is direct engagement with the consumer through digital vehicles. I call that out simply because it is an increasing -- it is increasingly the way we engage with consumers and it's a more effective and efficient way of doing so."

You know, Olivia, I think very good question. I think coming into the year, we were cognizant that while we thought foreign exchange would continued to be a headwind and of course, it does continue to be a headwind, that we would see little bit of a shift back towards more volume driven growth and less pricing driven growth. And indeed that is the way it has played out in the first quarter. And the first quarter has seen a fairly significant headwind for the average of the quarter in terms of foreign exchange. Although as you rightly say, easing as the quarter ended. So when you look at foreign exchange per se, our current planning sees a lessening of the headwind as the year unfolds. Indeed, yes, lessening of the headwinds sequentially quarter by quarter, which is a good thing. And we will continue to take the pricing that we need to take to offset any transaction impact. But yes, consistent with the comments we made at the beginning of the year, pricing will be less of a factor in 2016 than it was in 2015."

Share is a more complicated answer and I will give you the data you request. But a few things to say. First of all, obviously, we took out Venezuela year-over-year. Secondly, without dwelling on it, foreign exchange plays a role in the aggregation of share. And thirdly, our volume shares continue to perform quite nicely. In terms of China, the short-term share impact, and we only have the first 2 months of the year, so it's a year-on-year comparison, is down 1 share point, one, on down to 33 from approaching from 34.

And despite all the headlines, quite broadly across the emerging markets, still running mid-single digits on a local currency basis.

We continue to operate very well in that environment, as Bina mentioned, with our market share progress. And I think that's very -- I think that's very healthy. So that's the way -- North America, there's always a component in North America when you remember that the couponing for the trial of new products is covered in the trade spending. That is a factor in North America. And so as we have have heightened innovation activity, you will see more of the trial generating couponing, which translates through enterprise. And in both cases, as the year unfolds, we are expecting that negative pricing to ameliorate somewhat pleasingly. Of course, gross margins in both the case of North America and Europe, were up for the quarter and we expect them to be up for the year as well. So as we think about our marketing mix and where we make our investments, you look at the share, you look at the gross margin progress, you look at the top line progress, we think we're managing that balance in a responsible way."

So there is, in these numbers, no destocking, refilling of inventory. These are through volume numbers in Latin America and we feel good about that. We do think, and this is what we've tried to intimate on the fourth quarter when people were a little bit concerned and probing on the negative volume in Latin America, that there would be a little bit of a lag, given the significant pricing we took in the fourth quarter for volume to bounce back. But I think we were quite clear that we did expect 2016 to be a year where our organic would share more to volume than to the pricing. So that's what I think we are seeing in Latin America.

But then, what you see is, over time, the pricing in the marketplace move up. So I would say the general experience is you have to be a little bit patient sometimes. But eventually, the patience sees the market rise. There is certainly in most markets no retailer resistance because they understand the concept of translation driven inflation very well -- to the extent that transaction is not as significant as it has been in 2015. As I said earlier, our expectation is that we will be taking lesser pricing this year than last. But over half of the pricing we came in to 2016 with is rollover pricing even excluding Venezuela. So I would say that's the way to profile it. Interestingly, if you focus your innovation on bringing benefits, think of whitening as we have done, you can actually charge a meaningful premium price in the category, lift the category and bring the consumer with you. And obviously, I think it's the duty of marketing companies to find those consumer needs that you can really deliver against at a price point where they see value."

As I think we've demonstrated in the first quarter, our gross margin expansion is broader than Latin America and we expect that to be the case going forward. And that's the way we should think about it. We should also come back to the top line and repeat that without Venezuela, we are still saying we expect our top line to increase in that 4 to 7 ranged excluding Venezuela where 5% was a good start. When you turn to interest income and the recording of that, I guess what we're looking at here is that the interest income will be down. But net-net, the range of interest we will be paying will be in the $30 million to $35 million a quarter range, which is up on prior year. Okay.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted with our strong start to the year. Organic sales growth is well within our targeted range of 4% to 7%. Our gross profit margin reached a long-standing goal of 60%. Advertising as a percent of sales with at a solid 10.6%, even with the year-ago quarter, but up 230 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015 behind strong new product activity. 
Currency headwinds continued in the quarter and we were able to take pricing to partially offset those headwinds and still deliver volume growth. And as you will hear as I go through the divisions, our market shares are strong and growing. We're well into our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Savings are projected to be within our announced ranges. And our funding-the-growth initiatives have delivered another solid 130 basis points benefit on the gross margin line in the quarter. 
Current estimates show the benefit from these funding-the-growth initiatives increasing as we go through the year. Our balance sheet is solid. Working capital is down from the prior year. We announced a dividend increase effective this quarter and our share buyback program continues. 
So then let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. This division reported solid results. Innovation helped to fuel growth, and our market shares were up or stable in 8 of 11 categories. Our new products were well supported with impactful integrated marketing campaigns with activation in-store as well as in traditional media and digital. In toothpaste, as mentioned, we've achieved market leadership on a year-to-date basis, up 50 basis points to almost 36% of the market. And you may recall that we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter, we launched a companion mouthwash, which allowed us to offer a regimen approach and was supported by shelf displays in-store. As a result, Colgate Total toothpaste achieved its highest first quarter share since 2013. 
We continue to expand our line of Colgate Optic White whitening toothpaste with the launch of High Impact White. Priced at an uber-premium price point, this innovation offers 4 shades visibly whiter teeth by brushing twice daily for 6 weeks. Part of our integrated marketing campaign associated with the launch was sponsorship of the 2016 Country Music Awards, with displays in the presenter holding room as well as the Colgate Optic White hair and makeup room. The Colgate Optic White line now has 6 variants, all premium or uber-premium priced, holds a record 6% market share year-to-date. 
Also, in the first quarter, we launched Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste, which helps repair weakened enamel with vital minerals. The launch was supported by Smile with Strength campaign, one of the strongest testing campaigns ever for the enamel health range. And in addition, we provided strong support to the dental professionals with extensive sampling, print ads and dental journals, conventions, education and detailing. We continue to widen our lead in the manual toothbrush category. A significant contributor has been our line of Colgate 360° toothbrushes. The most recent introduction was Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush, a differentiated and incremental innovation which brought the 360 franchise share to a record 23% year-to-date. 
Our body wash shares are up 50 basis points year-to-date to 9.5%. Contributing to this success is our new line of Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, formulated to leave the skin feeling soft after showering. In early reads, it is exceeding our performance expectations. From then, we launched Irish Spring Signature for Men Clean and Scrub Exfoliating Body Wash, crafted with authentic extract, as well as the classic Irish Spring scent in a convenient pump. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Results were solid in this division as well. A very full innovation grid fueled volume and market share growth. Market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, deodorants and fabric conditioners. Our toothbrush share across Europe increased 40 basis points, increasing our market-leading position. 
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we extended our #1 position by 170 basis points year-to-date, and in fabric conditioner, by 150 basis points year-to-date. In toothpaste, our first quarter launch of Colgate Total Deep Clean has helped drive share. To build on the success of the Colgate Total line, we also launched Colgate Total Proof with color change technology so you can see it working. 
In the sensitivity segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Extra Strength toothpaste, which stops sensitivity pain instantly by repairing the open channels to sensitive tooth nerves and strengthens the protective layer while strengthening the teeth. And under the elmex brand, we're launching elmex Repair & Prevent toothpaste, which repairs sensitive areas of teeth to prevent further sensitivity. 
Now we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. This launch is off to a very strong start. In the second month of launch, we reached almost a 20% share in France and almost 15% in Belgium. So this quarter, we're taking the device plus chemistry format into the sensitivity segment with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Toothbrush + Built-In Sensitivity Pen. This provides instant and long-lasting sensitivity relief with the targeted application. Simply brush, treat and go. 
As with Oral Care, our Personal Care new product pipeline has been full and has helped increase our share in body wash, soaps and deodorants. We told you last quarter about a very exciting premium price line, Palmolive Skin Garden. This regimen approach offering of body wash, bath foam, liquid hand soap and bar soap has met with good early success. 
Our Sanex innovations, Sanex Advanced shower oils and body balms, are also driving results. In France, for example, our Sanex body wash share is at 10.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 full points from the year-ago period and the leading brand in the market. 
To keep up the momentum this quarter, we're launching Sanex Soft Freshness underarm protection, filling an important portfolio gap. Freshness is among the top consumer expectations in the category and is highly incremental to our portfolio with a unique formula that slowly releases pleasant fragrances. 
And in fabric conditioner, we're very excited about our new line of Soupline Complete Care, which we expect to further drive our leading share position. At a super premium price, this new product employs innovative technology to deliver 3 sought-after benefits: irresistible softness, anti-peeling and color protection. The bottle design has outstanding on-shelf impact, and we expect the launch to receive unprecedented support in this category. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business in Latin America remains strong despite macroeconomic challenges in some of our larger markets. Market shares increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, shampoo, bar soaps and liquid cleaners. Our regional toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to almost 76% year-to-date. In Brazil, our share climbed 160 basis points to 73.3% year-to-date, driven by our base businesses such as anti-cavity and Colgate Triple Action as well as our premium-priced sensitivity business. Our regional manual toothbrush share was up 50 basis points to 41.5% year-to-date. Our regional mouthwash share increased 50 basis points as well to 31.2% year-to-date. 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile all performed well in mouthwash. Brazil share increased 150 basis points to 34.5% due to the very successful launch of Plax Ice Infinity. In bar soaps, where our year-to-date share is over 29%, Protex and Palmolive continue to be the #1 and 2 brands across Latin America. Year-to-date, we've reached record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. In Mexico, innovations such as Palmolive Almond and Omega-3 Oil, supported by impactful shopper marketing programs, continues to drive demand. 
And we're excited about the upcoming innovation grid for this quarter. In Oral Care, we'll be launching a complete regimen behind Colgate Sensitive Pro-Alivio toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash, and we will offer new improved graphics across the line. 
In the kids segment, we're launching Colgate Smiles Minions toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash with the characters kids love. The introduction was timed with the release of the Minions movie across the region.
And to continue the momentum in fabric conditioner, we're launching Suavitel Superior Care. Consumers in this region feel that they're constantly washing clothes, making them look worn-out too quickly. But this new product conditions each individual fiber to reduce wear-out and extend the life of one's clothes. It will be available in our traditional fragrance as well as a new unique and sweet vanilla one. 
Turning then to Asia. Business is solid in this region. While overall leadership regional shares in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes have started the year a bit soft, select countries showed good results. As referenced in the earnings press release, toothpaste shares increased in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and Pakistan. Our manual toothbrush share in India is up 220 basis points to a market-leading 45.7% year-to-date, due in part to innovation in the black bristle segment.  Innovation launched late in the first quarter and coming in the second quarter should help drive results going forward. 
In India, we have just launched Colgate Pain Out. Tooth pain is one of the most common dental problems for Indian consumers, and heretofore, there was no targeted solution for the pain, which can come with no warning. Colgate Pain Out is a targeted spot-based application gel that provides express relief from tooth pain. It's been launched in pharmacies across the country and is met with a very good early success while helping to build Colgate's therapeutic equity in the pharmacy channel. 
The Naturals segment in India has been growing rapidly, and to capitalize on this, we're revitalizing our Colgate Active Salt toothpaste bundle. This comes in 3 variants: original, with lemon and Neem. And also in this segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Clove Essence toothpaste, which provides long-lasting relief from sensitivity with the natural essence of clove. For children in India ages 2 to 5, we're introducing a line of toothpaste, which are mild and safe and have flavors kids love, strawberry and bubble fruit. 
In China, we're relaunching with new graphics and packaging across the toothpaste product portfolio. Colgate 360°, which reduces bacteria for a 360° healthier mouth; Colgate Max Fresh with the 3x freshness shock wave; and Colgate Power White with a wide range of flavor offerings: dazzling mint, sparkling mint, lemon mineral salt, bamboo charcoal mint and jasmine white teeth. In the toothbrush category in India, we've just introduced the Colgate A1 [ph] toothbrush. Now as you know, this country of over 1.3 billion people, we have a large opportunity to increase penetration and consumption in the lower income segment. These consumers believe that a toothbrush with a broad yet compact head and dense bristles not only cleans effectively but is also durable and longer lasting. Colgate A1 meets this need and is priced at an affordable value price point. So this should help us continue to grow our leading manual toothbrush market share. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales growth in this region was strong, and given the 17% currency headwind, the growth came largely from price as we needed to take significant pricing in certain markets. However, in certain markets such as Russia, we achieved both pricing and volume growth. Innovation has been instrumental in driving our results and there's more to come. In the toothpaste whitening category, we're launching Colgate Optic White Lasting White. Its clinically proven white seal technology makes teeth one shade whiter in 1 week, while preventing stains and seals out even tough stains from food and drink. 
Across Africa, we're introducing a second tier of pricing for the premium Colgate Optic White line with impactful cracked ice packaging. In the manual toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Developed for the consumer with sensitivity, the brush has ultrasoft bristles and small tuft holes that provided gentle mouth feel and an ultracompact head that easily navigates in the mouth. 
And in the deodorant category in Russia where we have a solid business, we just launched Lady Speed Stick Bio Protection in March. This line effectively protects against sweat and odor while also caring for your skin health. The product contains a biocontrol complex clinically proven to provide protection while keeping your skin healthy without irritation. And as you would expect, it's being supported by in-store shopper support, which should drive good results. 
Finally, turning to Hill's. Hill's continues to deliver well-balanced mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Business is good domestically and overseas, both in the therapeutic and wellness categories. In the Hill's Prescription Diet line, Metabolic Plus continues to perform well. First launched a year ago, it's now sold in 42 countries. The offering of a complete range of dry food and stews has been supported by extensive sampling and in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools. And as a result, sales of this product in the first quarter were almost 30% ahead of our expectations. 
Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight is also meeting with success. In the first quarter, we added Perfect Weight wet in stew form to the existing dry line. As you may recall, this innovation is breakthrough nutrition formulated to help dogs achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 
Another first quarter introduction was Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which offers our new alginate technology in our wellness line to deliver superior-looking, tasty, wet food. This innovation is consistent with the trend of humanization in pet food, and the launch was supported by NCAP placements in some of the pet superstores, at shelf signage, on-pack stickers, sampling in-store and online support and digital media. 
Launching this quarter, our Hill's Prescription Diet Mobility Treat, great-tasting treats that support veterinarians' nutritional recommendation and management of dogs with mobility issues. These are baked treats such as a pet parent would make at home and form part of an effective nutritional regimen for dogs eating our Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility or Prescription Diet j/d therapeutic pet foods. 
So in summary, we're delighted with our strong start to the year, building on the momentum with which we exited 2015. And as you've heard, we delivered robust organic sales growth, good gross profit margin growth and solid advertising support behind a full range of new products across categories. Our consistent strategies, which you all know well, have yet again stood us in good stead. Colgate people around the world, as always, are working hard to deliver encouraging results. So we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go through the balance of the year. 
And Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to you to start the Q&A session."

Good to see the snap back. Also good to see the gross margin progression. On that front, just a quick question for clarification to make sure we understand how to model this in the forward. Going through the Q, it looks like the biggest swing factor in the margin progression came at that clubbed line, the group line of cost inflation, FX and obviously we've now added Venezuela deconsolidation in there. We went from a 420 basis point drag to around 130 basis point drag. Can you elaborate on the puts and takes that caused that 290 basis point swing? And ideally, although I'm not sure you're going to answer it, if you could break out the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation."

I frankly would start by reiterating what Bina said, that we are pleased, as you amplified, Jason, with the start to the year. We think it does reflect constancy of strategy and constancy of execution. And pleasingly, the first quarter arrived pretty much as I think we had described to you it would when we were last on the call, which is to say that our top line would grow between 4% and 7% organically, excluding Venezuela. Around 5% was entirely consistent with the fourth quarter. We said that we expected our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points, and we're very pleased with the 110 and with the increased advertising behind the innovation and all of that flowing through to the bottom line. I guess, my comment on the gross profit would be, if you look at the shape of our business, gross profit improved across all of our divisions with the exception of Hill's for a known commodity issue. So it is not limited to Latin America. And across Latin America, we took a pretty significant pricing on the back of significant pricing all 2015 to offset further transaction impact, obviously, again, without Venezuela. And we were pleased in Latin America. As we suggest, it might be the case that the volume negative that we saw in the fourth quarter rebounded, I think confirming the fact that although there is always a lead lag, we have good consumer loyalty and adoption even at higher price points. So the way I would frame gross margin is we started at the end of the first quarter saying that our gross margin would expand 75 to 125 basis points for a host of reasons, part of which was Venezuela, but our funding the growth was an important piece of it as well. And again, 110 is pleasing, and as we look forward, I guess, we would say we expect to have gross margin to continue to improve from the first quarter level over the balance of the year and would now say that for the full year, we expect our gross margin to come in towards the high end of our 75 to 125 basis point range, maybe even slightly ahead of that, depending on where transaction headwinds go. We said the last time that we thought gross margin expansion after the plateau over the last 2 to 3 years was an important part of 2016. And clearly, that focus remains in the company. And let me just conclude by saying and perhaps giving you the gross profit roll forward year-on-year. So if you go back to the first quarter of 2015, we had a gross profit margin of 58.9%. We picked up 70 basis points of pricing between restructuring and funding the growth, 140 basis points. And as you know, that builds -- tends to build across the year. Material prices, as you say, 130 basis points negative, which is partly underlying commodity prices and does include a little bit of Venezuela. All other, 30 basis points, and so the current year gross profit at 60%. But I think the important point to make is growth between 4% and 7%, excluding Venezuela, starting well at 5% and gross profit starting well at 110 basis points and now saying that we expect to be at the high end of the 75 to 125 range, maybe a little bit more."

I know we all focus on weekly shares, but I guess, just putting both in a slightly longer-term context, if you take China over the last 8 years, our share has increased from about 30% to 33% when our principal multinational competitor has declined from 24% to about 12%. And in India, if you take the same time period, our market share has increased from about 48% to be near 54% that we start the year with. And similarly, our principal multinational competitor is down from 20% -- 29% to 21%. So we continue to feel very good about the progress over time we are making. In both cases, let's start with India, in both cases, the short-term share impact comes from local competitors with heightened promotional activity. That is also the case in China. In both cases, we went through the innovation and go-to-market plans that are already being adopted in India and China to take corrective action against that short-term slowdown.

The -- so yes, we were actually quite pleased with the strong advertising level we had in the first quarter. As Bina said, up meaningfully on the second half of last year and in line with a strong first quarter of 2015. Obviously, behind a broad and deep array of innovation that we have coming to our markets around the world starting in the first quarter, but of course, coming for the rest of the year as well. And our current plan would see us increasing our advertising spend year-on-year, both absolutely and as a percentage to sales. That is what we said the last time we spoke and we remain in that position. It would not be a Colgate earnings call if I weren't to emphasize the point that we continue to balance this investment behind our brand health and the innovation we have with the very compelling and broad array of in-store activity that we are able to deploy. And so in fact, our commercial investment continues to be up as well in the first quarter, which is to say, the money that we are investing for in-store activity has increased and is on top of the increased ratio of spend on traditional advertising versus the fourth quarter of last year. The other thing I would say in terms of efficiency of advertising, because we are seeing it becoming quite a meaningful component of how we go to market a lot more and we spent quite a lot of time showcasing this in CAGNY, for those of you that were there or have read the transcript, a lot about consumer engagement, particularly given the changing demographics in the world, is now with digital advertising. Digital advertising is more efficient than the traditional print, television, radio, billboard type of advertising. And interestingly, to the point in Asia, a significant part of the investment we make these days, indeed approaching 50% in the case of China, is direct engagement with the consumer through digital vehicles. I call that out simply because it is an increasing -- it is increasingly the way we engage with consumers and it's a more effective and efficient way of doing so."

Olivia, I think -- very good question. I think coming into the year, we were cognizant that while we thought foreign exchange would continue to be a headwind, and of course, it does continue to be a headwind, that we would see a little bit of a shift back towards more volume-driven growth and less pricing-driven growth. And indeed, that is the way it has played out in the first quarter. And the first quarter has seen a fairly significant headwind for the average of the quarter in terms of foreign exchange, although, as you rightly say, easing as the quarter ended. So when you look at foreign exchange per se, our current planning sees a lessening of the headwind as the year unfolds. Indeed, yes, lessening of the headwinds sequentially quarter by quarter, which is a good thing. And we will continue to take the pricing that we need to take to offset any transaction impact. But yes, consistent with the comments we made at the beginning of the year, pricing will be less of a factor in 2016 than it was in 2015."

Share is a more complicated answer and I will give you the data you request. But a few things to say. First of all, obviously, we took out Venezuela year-on-year. Secondly, without dwelling on it, foreign exchange plays a role in the aggregation of share. And thirdly, our volume shares continue to perform quite nicely. In terms of China, the short-term share impact, and we only have the first 2 months of the year so it's a year-on-year comparison, is down 1 share point, one, on -- down to 33 from approaching from 34.

Well, Europe is not new news, Dara, and is consistent with prior year, frankly, slightly better than prior year. We have talked -- let's start with the consumer. We've talked about the category environments in the geographies around the world where the growth of categories, I'm now talking our categories as somewhat muted in the 0% to 2% range in the U.S. We're now sort of in the 2% to 3% range, edging towards the 3%. And despite all of the headlines, quite broadly across the emerging markets, still running mid-single digits on a local currency basis. So the marketplace promotional intensity, not tracing to any particular competitor, is as it has been in Europe. There's really nothing new there. We continue to operate very well in that environment, as Bina mentioned, with our market share progress. And I think that's very healthy. So that's the way I'd answer that. North America, there is always a component in North America when you remember that the couponing for the trial of new products is covered in the trade spending. That is a factor in North America. And so as we have heightened innovation activity, you will see more of the trial generating couponing, which translates true into price. And in both cases, as the year unfolds, we are expecting that negative pricing to ameliorate somewhat pleasingly. Of course, gross margins, in both the case of North America and Europe, were up for the quarter and we expect them to be up for the year as well. So as we think about our marketing mix and where we make our investments, you look at the share, you look at the gross margin progress, you look at the top line progress, we think we're managing that balance in a responsible way."

The answer is on the inventory side, if you go back to the inventory events in China and Brazil sometime back, I think we were one of the first companies to come forward and describe what was going on in the marketplace. We have a very tight control on the distributors and the wholesalers that we use in these markets to bring inventory to the consumer. So there is, in these numbers, no destocking, refilling of inventory. These are through volume numbers in Latin America and we feel good about that. We do think, and this is what we tried to intimate on the fourth quarter when people were a little bit concerned and probing on the negative volume in Latin America, that there would be a little bit of a lag, given the significant pricing we took in the fourth quarter, for volume to bounce back. But I think we were quite clear that we did expect 2016 to be a year where our organic would shave more to the volume than to the pricing. So that's what I think we are seeing in Latin America.

And in China, it's not doom and gloom. Some concerns, but not the headlines that we read every day. Conversely, in Russia and Brazil, the consumer sentiment, as we have said before, is more negative. So I think the way we are thinking about it is more in terms of the consumers' consumption behavior as we measure it in those markets, and that seems to suggest that we will be going forward with categories growing, in general terms, mid-single digits on a local constant currency basis.

Yes, Latin America is a very changeable economic arena in our world, and you can go back to the '80s and perhaps seen many companies be hurt by economic events and perhaps reduced focus on Latin America or even withdrawal from Latin America. We, at that time, stayed and we learned how to operate in these volatile environments. And frankly, a lot of it starts with pricing to make sure you have a margin that allows you to invest to grow a brand. I think if you come to Brazil, the position we have with 74% share in toothpaste, leadership share in toothbrushes and jockeying for leadership in mouth rinse, Colgate is an enormously well-trusted brand in Brazil. And we bring significant innovation to the Brazilian marketplace. Interestingly, innovation that is not necessarily cheap, but which the consumer sees value in. We're also very disciplined in terms of our go to market. To the question asked earlier, we make sure that we bring to the marketplace the volume of product that the consumer is purchasing, so we don't create an inventory dislocation that you then have to unwind. So the combination of all of that has seen the share grow, and indeed, quite pleasingly, volume grow as well."

I was wondering if it was your looking out over the next couple of quarters and recognizing there will soon be some local inflation and you'll be -- you're trying to price as fast as you can? Can you give a sense if any of your competitors are perhaps a bit more price constrained? Are they sort of priced to a prior peak of inflation? So the sort of different dynamics and how you're approaching pricing in the next couple of quarters versus some of your competitors."

So whether you're multinational or local, you're going to get the impact eventually. But then, what you see is, over time, the pricing in the marketplace move up. So I would say the general experience is you have to be a little bit patient sometimes. But eventually, the patience sees the market rise. There is certainly in most markets no retailer resistance because they understand the concept of translation-driven inflation very well to the extent that transaction is not as significant as it has been in 2015. As I said earlier, our expectation is that we will be taking lesser pricing this year than last. But over half of the pricing we came into 2016 with is rollover pricing, even excluding Venezuela. So I would say that's the way to profile it. Interestingly, if you focus your innovation on bringing benefits, think of whitening as we have done, you can actually charge a meaningful premium price in a category, lift the category and bring the consumer with you. And obviously, I think it's the duty of the marketing companies to find those consumer needs that you can really deliver against at a price point wherein they see value."

And that's the way we should think about it. We should also come back to the top line and repeat that without Venezuela, we are still saying we expect our top line to increase in that 4% to 7% range, excluding Venezuela, and 5% was a good start.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted with our strong start to the year. Organic sales growth is well within our targeted range of 4% to 7%. Our gross profit margin reached a long-standing goal of 60%. Advertising as a percent of sales was at a solid 10.6%, even with the year-ago quarter, but up 230 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015 behind strong new product activity. 
Currency headwinds continued in the quarter and we were able to take pricing to partially offset those headwinds and still deliver volume growth. And as you will hear as I go through the divisions, our market shares are strong and growing. We're well into our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Savings are projected to be within our announced ranges. And our funding-the-growth initiatives have delivered another solid 130 basis points benefit on the gross margin line in the quarter. 
Current estimates show the benefit from these funding-the-growth initiatives increasing as we go through the year. Our balance sheet is solid. Working capital is down from the prior year. We announced a dividend increase effective this quarter and our share buyback program continues. 
So then let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. This division reported solid results. Innovation helped to fuel growth, and our market shares were up or stable in 8 of 11 categories. Our new products were well supported with impactful integrated marketing campaigns with activation in-store as well as in traditional media and digital. In toothpaste, as mentioned, we've achieved market leadership on a year-to-date basis, up 50 basis points to almost 36% of the market. And you may recall that we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter, we launched a companion mouthwash, which allowed us to offer a regimen approach and was supported by shelf displays in-store. As a result, Colgate Total toothpaste achieved its highest first quarter share since 2013. 
We continue to expand our line of Colgate Optic White whitening toothpaste with the launch of High Impact White. Priced at an uber-premium price point, this innovation offers 4 shades visibly whiter teeth by brushing twice daily for 6 weeks. Part of our integrated marketing campaign associated with the launch was sponsorship of the 2016 Country Music Awards, with displays in the presenter holding room as well as the Colgate Optic White hair and makeup room. The Colgate Optic White line now with 6 variants, all premium or uber-premium priced, holds a record 6% market share year-to-date. 
Also, in the first quarter, we launched Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste, which helps repair weakened enamel with vital minerals. The launch was supported by our Smile with Strength campaign, one of the strongest testing campaigns ever for the enamel health range. And in addition, we provided strong support to the dental professionals with extensive sampling, print ads and dental journals, conventions, education and detailing. We continue to widen our lead in the manual toothbrush category. A significant contributor has been our line of Colgate 360° toothbrushes. The most recent introduction was Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush, a differentiated and incremental innovation which brought the 360 franchise share to a record 23% year-to-date. 
Our body wash shares are up 50 basis points year-to-date to 9.5%. Contributing to this success is our new line of Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, formulated to leave the skin feeling soft after showering. In early reads, it is exceeding our performance expectations. From then, we launched Irish Spring Signature for Men Clean and Scrub Exfoliating Body Wash, crafted with authentic extract, as well as the classic Irish Spring scent in a convenient pump. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Results were solid in this division as well. A very full innovation grid fueled volume and market share growth. Market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, deodorants and fabric conditioners. Our toothbrush share across Europe increased 40 basis points, increasing our market-leading position. 
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we extended our #1 position by 170 basis points year-to-date, and in fabric conditioner, by 150 basis points year-to-date. In toothpaste, our first quarter launch of Colgate Total Deep Clean has helped to drive share. To build on the success of the Colgate Total line, we also launched Colgate Total Proof with color change technology so you can see it working. 
In the sensitivity segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Extra Strength toothpaste, which stops sensitivity pain instantly by repairing the open channels to sensitive tooth nerves and strengthens the protective layer while strengthening the teeth. And under the elmex brand, we're launching elmex Repair & Prevent toothpaste, which repairs sensitive areas of teeth to prevent further sensitivity. 
Now we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. This launch is off to a very strong start. In the second month of launch, we reached almost a 20% share in France and almost 15% in Belgium. So this quarter, we're taking the device plus chemistry format into the sensitivity segment with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Toothbrush + Built-In Sensitivity Pen. This provides instant and long-lasting sensitivity relief with a targeted application. Simply brush, treat and go. 
As with Oral Care, our Personal Care new product pipeline has been full and has helped increase our share in body wash, soaps and deodorants. We told you last quarter about a very exciting premium price line, Palmolive Skin Garden. This regimen approach offering of body wash, bath foam, liquid hand soap, and bar soap has met with good early success. 
Our Sanex innovations, Sanex Advanced shower oils and body balms, are also driving results. In France, for example, our Sanex body wash share is at 10.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 full points from the year-ago period and the leading brand in the market. 
To keep up the momentum this quarter, we're launching Sanex Soft Freshness underarm protection, filling an important portfolio gap. Freshness is among the top consumer expectations in the category and is highly incremental to our portfolio with a unique formula that slowly releases pleasant fragrances. 
And in fabric conditioner, we're very excited about our new line of Soupline Complete Care, which we expect to further drive our leading share position. At a super-premium price, this new product employs innovative technology to deliver 3 sought-after benefits: irresistible softness, anti-peeling and color protection. The bottle design has outstanding on-shelf impact, and we expect the launch to receive unprecedented support in this category. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business in Latin America remains strong despite macroeconomic challenges in some of our larger markets. Market shares increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, shampoo, bar soaps and liquid cleaners. Our regional toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to almost 76% year-to-date. In Brazil, our share climbed 160 basis points to 73.3% year-to-date, driven by our base businesses such as anti-cavity and Colgate Triple Action, as well as our premium-priced sensitivity business. Our regional manual toothbrush share was up 50 basis points to 41.5% year-to-date. Our regional mouthwash share increased 50 basis points as well to 31.2% year-to-date. 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile all performed well in mouthwash. Brazil share increased 150 basis points to 34.5% due to the very successful launch of Plax Ice Infinity. In bar soaps, where our year-to-date share is over 29%, Protex and Palmolive continue to be the #1 and 2 brands across Latin America. Year-to-date, we've reached record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. In Mexico, innovations such as Palmolive Almond and Omega-3 Oil, supported by impactful shopper marketing programs, continues to drive demand. 
And we're excited about the upcoming innovation grid for this quarter. In Oral Care, we'll be launching a complete regimen behind Colgate Sensitive Pro-Alivio toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash, and we will offer new improved graphics across the line. 
In the kids segment, we're launching Colgate Smiles Minions toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash with the characters kids love. The introduction was timed with the release of the Minions movie across the region.
And to continue the momentum in fabric conditioner, we're launching Suavitel Superior Care. Consumers in this region feel that they're constantly washing clothes, making them look worn-out too quickly. But this new product conditions each individual fiber to reduce wear-out and extend the life of one's clothes. It will be available in our traditional fragrance as well as a new unique and sweet vanilla one. 
Turning then to Asia. Business is solid in this region. While overall leadership regional shares in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes have started the year a bit soft, select countries showed good results. As referenced in the earnings press release, toothpaste shares increased in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and Pakistan. Our manual toothbrush share in India is up 220 basis points to a market-leading 45.7% year-to-date, due in part to innovation in the black bristle segment.  Innovation launched late in the first quarter and coming in the second quarter should help drive results going forward. 
In India, we have just launched Colgate Pain Out. Tooth pain is one of the most common dental problems for Indian consumers, and heretofore, there was no targeted solution for the pain, which can come with no warning. Colgate Pain Out is a targeted spot-based application gel that provides express relief from tooth pain. It's been launched in pharmacies across the country and has met with a very good early success while helping to build Colgate's therapeutic equity in the pharmacy channel. 
The Naturals segment in India has been growing rapidly, and to capitalize on this, we're revitalizing our Colgate Active Salt toothpaste bundle. This comes in 3 variants: original, with lemon and Neem. And also in this segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Clove Essence toothpaste, which provides long-lasting relief from sensitivity with the natural essence of clove. For children in India ages 2 to 5, we're introducing a line of toothpaste, which are mild and safe and have flavors kids love, strawberry and bubble fruit. 
In China, we're relaunching with new graphics and packaging across the toothpaste product portfolio. Colgate 360°, which reduces bacteria for a 360° healthier mouth; Colgate Max Fresh with the 3x freshness shock wave; and Colgate Power White with a wide range of flavor offerings: dazzling mint, sparkling mint, lemon mineral salt, bamboo charcoal mint and jasmine white teeth. In the toothbrush category in India, we've just introduced the Colgate A1 [ph] toothbrush. Now as you know, in this country of over 1.3 billion people, we have a large opportunity to increase penetration and consumption in the lower income segment. These consumers believe that a toothbrush with a broad yet compact head and dense bristles not only cleans effectively but is also durable and longer lasting. Colgate A1 meets this need and is priced at an affordable value price point. So this should help us continue to grow our leading manual toothbrush market share. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales growth in this region was strong, and given the 17% currency headwind, the growth came largely from price as we needed to take significant pricing in certain markets. However, in certain markets such as Russia, we achieved both pricing and volume growth. Innovation has been instrumental in driving our results and there's more to come. In the toothpaste whitening category, we're launching Colgate Optic White Lasting White. Its clinically proven white seal technology makes teeth one shade whiter in 1 week, while preventing stains and it seals out even tough stains from food and drink. 
Across Africa, we're introducing a second tier of pricing for the premium Colgate Optic White line with impactful cracked ice packaging. In the manual toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Developed for the consumer with sensitivity, the brush has ultrasoft bristles and small tuft holes that provide a gentle mouth feel and an ultracompact head that easily navigates in the mouth. 
And in the deodorant category in Russia where we have a solid business, we just launched Lady Speed Stick Bio Protection in March. This line effectively protects against sweat and odor while also caring for your skin health. The product contains a biocontrol complex clinically proven to provide protection while keeping your skin healthy without irritation. And as you would expect, it's being supported by in-store shopper support, which should drive good results. 
Finally, turning to Hill's. Hill's continues to deliver well-balanced mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Business is good domestically and overseas, both in the therapeutic and wellness categories. In the Hill's Prescription Diet line, Metabolic Plus continues to perform well. First launched a year ago, it's now sold in 42 countries. The offering of a complete range of dry food and stews has been supported by extensive sampling and in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools. And as a result, sales of this product in the first quarter were almost 30% ahead of our expectations. 
Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight is also meeting with success. In the first quarter, we added Perfect Weight wet in stew form to the existing dry line. Now as you may recall, this innovation is breakthrough nutrition formulated to help dogs achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 
Another first quarter introduction was Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which offers our new alginate technology in our wellness line to deliver superior-looking, tasty, wet food. This innovation is consistent with the trend of humanization in pet food, and the launch was supported by NCAP placements in some of the pet superstores, at shelf signage, on-pack stickers, sampling in-store and online support and digital media. 
Launching this quarter is our Hill's Prescription Diet Mobility Treat, great-tasting treats that support veterinarians' nutritional recommendation and management of dogs with mobility issues. These are baked treats such as a pet parent would make at home, and form part of an effective nutritional regimen for dogs eating our Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility or Prescription Diet j/d therapeutic pet foods. 
So in summary, we're delighted with our strong start to the year, building on the momentum with which we exited 2015. And as you've heard, we delivered robust organic sales growth, good gross profit margin growth and solid advertising support behind a full range of new products across categories. Our consistent strategies, which you all know well, have yet again stood us in good stead. Colgate people around the world, as always, are working hard to deliver encouraging results. So we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go through the balance of the year. 
And Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to you to start the Q&A session."

Good to see the snap back. Also good to see the gross margin progression. On that front, just a quick question for clarification to make sure we understand how to model this in the forward. Going through the Q, it looks like the biggest swing factor in the margin progression came at that clubbed line, that group line of cost inflation, FX, and obviously you've now added Venezuela deconsolidation in there. We went from a 420 basis point drag to around 130 basis point drag. Can you elaborate on the puts and takes that caused that 290 basis point swing? And ideally, although I'm not sure you're going to answer it, if you could break out the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation."

I frankly would start by reiterating what Bina said, that we are pleased, as you amplified, Jason, with the start to the year. We think it does reflect constancy of strategy and constancy of execution. And pleasingly, the first quarter arrived pretty much as I think we had described to you it would when we were last on the call, which is to say that our top line would grow between 4% and 7% organically, excluding Venezuela, and 5% was entirely consistent with the fourth quarter. We said that we expected our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points, and we're very pleased with the 110 and with the increased advertising behind the innovation and all of that flowing through to the bottom line. I guess, my comment on the gross profit would be, if you look at the shape of our business, gross profit improved across all of our divisions with the exception of Hill's for a known commodity issue. So it is not limited to Latin America. And across Latin America, we took a pretty significant pricing on the back of significant pricing all of 2015 to offset further transaction impact, obviously, again, without Venezuela. And we were pleased in Latin America as we suggested might be the case.   The volume negative that we saw in the fourth quarter rebounded, I think confirming the fact that although there is always a lead lag, we have good consumer loyalty and adoption even at higher price points. So the way I would frame gross margin is, we started at the end of the first quarter saying that our gross margin would expand 75 to 125 basis points for a host of reasons, part of which was Venezuela, but our funding the growth was an important piece of it as well. And again, 110 is pleasing, and as we look forward, I guess, we would say we expect to have gross margin to continue to improve from the first quarter level over the balance of the year and would now say that for the full year, we expect our gross margin to come in towards the high end of our 75 to 125 basis point range, maybe even slightly ahead of that, depending on where transaction headwinds go. We said the last time that we thought gross margin expansion after the plateau over the last 2 to 3 years was an important part of 2016. And clearly, that focus remains in the company. And let me just conclude by saying and perhaps giving you the gross profit roll forward year-on-year. So if you go back to the first quarter of 2015, we had a gross profit margin of 58.9%. We picked up 70 basis points of pricing between restructuring and funding the growth, 140 basis points. And as you know, that builds -- tends to build across the year. Material prices, as you say, 130 basis points negative, which is partly underlying commodity prices and does include a little bit of Venezuela. All other 30 basis points, and so the current year gross profit at 60%. But I think the important point to make is, growth between 4% and 7%, excluding Venezuela, starting well at 5% and gross profit starting well at 110 basis points, and now saying that we expect to be at the high end of the 75 to 125 range, maybe a little bit more."

Yes, I think, as Bina said, market share up nicely in Brazil. Interestingly, market share up nicely in Russia. And in fact, a group of us were just in Asia, including India and China, a few weeks ago. And our share start to the year is a little bit softer than history in both cases, I guess. I know we all focus on weekly shares, but I guess, just putting both in a slightly longer-term context, if you take China over the last 8 years, our share has increased from about 30% to 33% when our principal multinational competitor has declined from 24% to about 12%. And in India, if you take the same time period, our market share has increased from about 48% to the near 54% that we start the year with. And similarly, our principal multinational competitor is down from 20% -- 29% to 21%. So we continue to feel very good about the progress over time we are making. In both cases, let's start with India, in both cases, the short-term share impact comes from local competitors with heightened promotional activity. That is also the case in China. In both cases, we went through the innovation and go-to-market plans that are already being adopted in India and China, to take corrective action against that short-term slowdown. And we feel good about making progress over the balance of the year."

As Bina said, up meaningfully on the second half of last year and in line with a strong first quarter of 2015. Obviously, behind a broad and deep array of innovation that we have coming to our markets around the world starting in the first quarter, but of course, coming for the rest of the year as well. And our current plan would see us increasing our advertising spend year-on-year, both absolutely and as a percentage to sales. That is what we said the last time we spoke and we remain in that position. It would not be a Colgate earnings call if I weren't to emphasize the point that we continue to balance this investment behind our brand health and the innovation we have with the very compelling and broad array of in-store activity that we are able to deploy. And so in fact, our commercial investment continues to be up as well in the first quarter, which is to say, the money that we are investing for in-store activity has increased, and is on top of the increased ratio of spend on traditional advertising versus the fourth quarter of last year. The other thing I would say in terms of efficiency of advertising, because we are seeing it becoming quite a meaningful component of how we go to market a lot more, and we spent quite a lot of time showcasing this in CAGNY, for those of you that were there or have read the transcript, a lot about consumer engagement, particularly given the changing demographics in the world, is now with digital advertising. Digital advertising is more efficient than the traditional print, television, radio, billboard type of advertising. And interestingly, to the point in Asia, a significant part of the investment we make these days, indeed approaching 50% in the case of China is direct engagement with the consumer through digital vehicles. I call that out simply because it is an increasing -- it is increasingly the way we engage with consumers and it's a more effective and efficient way of doing so."

I think coming into the year, we were cognizant that while we thought foreign exchange would continue to be a headwind, and of course, it does continue to be a headwind, that we would see a little bit of a shift back towards more volume-driven growth and less pricing-driven growth. And indeed, that is the way it has played out in the first quarter. And the first quarter has seen a fairly significant headwind for the average of the quarter in terms of foreign exchange, although, as you rightly say, easing as the quarter ended. So when you look at foreign exchange per se, our current planning sees a lessening of the headwind as the year unfolds. Indeed, yes, a lessening of the headwinds sequentially quarter by quarter, which is a good thing. And we will continue to take the pricing that we need to take to offset any transaction impact. But yes, consistent with the comments we made at the beginning of the year, pricing will be less of a factor in 2016 than it was in 2015."

Secondly, without dwelling on it, foreign exchange plays a role in the aggregation of share. And thirdly, our volume shares continue to perform quite nicely.

Well, Europe is not new news, Dara, and is consistent with prior year, frankly, slightly better than prior year. We have talked -- let's start with the consumer.

In the U.S. we're now sort of in the 2% to 3% range, edging towards the 3%. And despite all of the headlines, quite broadly across the emerging markets, still running at mid-single digits on a local currency basis. So the marketplace promotional intensity, not tracing to any particular competitor, is as it has been in Europe. There's really nothing new there. We continue to operate very well in that environment, as Bina mentioned, with our market share progress. And I think that's very healthy. So that's the way I'd answer that. North America, there is always a component in North America when you remember that the couponing for the trial of new products is covered in the trade spending. That is a factor in North America. And so as we have heightened innovation activity, you will see more of the trial generating couponing, which translates through into price. And in both cases, as the year unfolds, we are expecting that negative pricing to ameliorate somewhat. Pleasingly of course, gross margins, in both the case of North America and Europe, were up for the quarter and we expect them to be up for the year as well. So as we think about our marketing mix and where we make our investments, you look at the share, you look at the gross margin progress, you look at the top line progress, we think we're managing that balance in a responsible way."

We have a very tight control on the distributors and the wholesalers that we use in these markets to bring inventory to the consumer. So there is, in these numbers, no destocking, refilling of inventory. These are true volume numbers in Latin America, and we feel good about that. We do think, and this is what we tried to intimate on the fourth quarter when people were a little bit concerned and probing on the negative volume in Latin America, that there would be a little bit of a lag, given the significant pricing we took in the fourth quarter, for volume to bounce back. But I think we were quite clear that we did expect 2016 to be a year where our organic would shave more to the volume than to the pricing. So that's what I think we are seeing in Latin America.

And in China, it's not doom and gloom. Some concerns, but not the headlines that we read every day. Conversely, in Russia and Brazil, the consumer sentiment, as we have said before, is more negative.

We have advertising that is very different to the advertising that we use around the world in terms of engaging with the Chinese consumer. Now coming back to the Internet, we see this as an enormous opportunity in China. You're right. It is a relatively low percentage of sales in the categories in which we do business. Our business has been booming over the last 3 years. We have been growing market share, but we spent a lot of time when we were in Asia, particularly in China, addressing this topic. And we see Internet -- you think of the $0.10 and the Alibabas, we see Internet as a very rich area for future growth in China for us. But that is separate and apart from the sort of brick-and-mortar price promotion of the plethora of ""cheapy"" brands."

Yes, Latin America is a very changeable economic arena in our world, and you can go back to the '80s and perhaps see many companies be hurt by economic events and perhaps reduced focus on Latin America or even withdrawal from Latin America. We, at that time, stayed and we learned how to operate in these volatile environments. And frankly, a lot of it starts with pricing to make sure you have a margin that allows you to invest to grow a brand. I think if you come to Brazil, the position we have with 74% share in toothpaste, leadership share in toothbrushes and jockeying for leadership in mouth rinse, Colgate is an enormously well-trusted brand in Brazil. And we bring significant innovation to the Brazilian marketplace. Interestingly, innovation that is not necessarily cheap, but which the consumer sees value in. We're also very disciplined in terms of our go to market. To the question asked earlier, we make sure that we bring to the marketplace the volume of product that the consumer is purchasing, so we don't create an inventory dislocation that you then have to unwind. So the combination of all of that has seen the share grow, and indeed, quite pleasingly, volume grow as well."

I was wondering if it was you're looking out over the next couple of quarters and recognizing there will soon be some local inflation and you'll be -- you're trying to price in spots as you can? Do you have the sense that any of your competitors are perhaps a bit more price constrained? Are they sort of priced to a prior peak of inflation?

So whether you're multinational or local, you're going to get the impact eventually. But then, what you see is, over time, the pricing in the marketplace move up. So I would say the general experience is you have to be a little bit patient sometimes. But eventually the patience sees the market rise. There is certainly in most markets no retailer resistance because they understand the concept of translation-driven inflation very well to the extent that transaction is not as significant as it has been in 2015. As I said earlier, our expectation is that we will be taking lesser pricing this year than last. But over half of the pricing we came into 2016 with was rollover pricing, even excluding Venezuela. So I would say that's the way to profile it. Interestingly, if you focus your innovation on bringing benefits, think of whitening as we have done, you can actually charge a meaningful premium price in a category, lift the category and bring the consumer with you. And obviously, I think it's the duty of marketing companies to find those consumer needs that you can really deliver against at a price point wherein they see value."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted with our strong start to the year. Organic sales growth is well within our targeted range of 4% to 7%. Our gross profit margin reached a long-standing goal of 60%. Advertising as a percent of sales was at a solid 10.6%, even with the year-ago quarter, but up 230 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015 behind strong new product activity. 
Currency headwinds continued in the quarter and we were able to take pricing to partially offset those headwinds and still deliver volume growth. And as you will hear as I go through the divisions, our market shares are strong and growing. We're well into our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Savings are projected to be within our announced ranges. And our funding-the-growth initiatives have delivered another solid 130 basis points benefit on the gross margin line in the quarter. 
Current estimates show the benefit from these funding-the-growth initiatives increasing as we go through the year. Our balance sheet is solid. Working capital is down from the prior year. We announced a dividend increase effective this quarter and our share buyback program continues. 
So then let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. This division reported solid results. Innovation helped to fuel growth, and our market shares were up or stable in 8 of 11 categories. Our new products were well supported with impactful integrated marketing campaigns with activation in-store as well as in traditional media and digital. In toothpaste, as mentioned, we've achieved market leadership on a year-to-date basis, up 50 basis points to almost 36% of the market. And you may recall that we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter, we launched a companion mouthwash, which allowed us to offer a regimen approach and was supported by shelf displays in-store. As a result, Colgate Total toothpaste achieved its highest first quarter share since 2013. 
We continue to expand our line of Colgate Optic White whitening toothpaste with the launch of High Impact White. Priced at an uber-premium price point, this innovation offers 4 shades visibly whiter teeth by brushing twice daily for 6 weeks. Part of our integrated marketing campaign associated with the launch was sponsorship of the 2016 Country Music Awards, with displays in the presenter holding room as well as the Colgate Optic White hair and makeup room. The Colgate Optic White line now with 6 variants, all premium or uber-premium priced, holds a record 6% market share year-to-date. 
Also, in the first quarter, we launched Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste, which helps repair weakened enamel with vital minerals. The launch was supported by our Smile with Strength campaign, one of the strongest testing campaigns ever for the enamel health range. And in addition, we provided strong support to the dental professionals with extensive sampling, print ads and dental journals, conventions, education and detailing. We continue to widen our lead in the manual toothbrush category. A significant contributor has been our line of Colgate 360° toothbrushes. The most recent introduction was Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush, a differentiated and incremental innovation which brought the 360 franchise share to a record 23% year-to-date. 
Our body wash shares are up 50 basis points year-to-date to 9.5%. Contributing to this success is our new line of Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, formulated to leave the skin feeling soft after showering. In early reads, it is exceeding our performance expectations. From then, we launched Irish Spring Signature for Men Clean and Scrub Exfoliating Body Wash, crafted with authentic extract, as well as the classic Irish Spring scent in a convenient pump. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Results were solid in this division as well. A very full innovation grid fueled volume and market share growth. Market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, deodorants and fabric conditioners. Our toothbrush share across Europe increased 40 basis points, increasing our market-leading position. 
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we extended our #1 position by 170 basis points year-to-date, and in fabric conditioner, by 150 basis points year-to-date. In toothpaste, our first quarter launch of Colgate Total Deep Clean has helped to drive share. To build on the success of the Colgate Total line, we also launched Colgate Total Proof with color change technology so you can see it working. 
In the sensitivity segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Extra Strength toothpaste, which stops sensitivity pain instantly by repairing the open channels to sensitive tooth nerves and strengthens the protective layer while strengthening the teeth. And under the elmex brand, we're launching elmex Repair & Prevent toothpaste, which repairs sensitive areas of teeth to prevent further sensitivity. 
Now we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. This launch is off to a very strong start. In the second month of launch, we reached almost a 20% share in France and almost 15% in Belgium. So this quarter, we're taking the device plus chemistry format into the sensitivity segment with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Toothbrush + Built-In Sensitivity Pen. This provides instant and long-lasting sensitivity relief with a targeted application. Simply brush, treat and go. 
As with Oral Care, our Personal Care new product pipeline has been full and has helped increase our share in body wash, soaps and deodorants. We told you last quarter about a very exciting premium price line, Palmolive Skin Garden. This regimen approach offering of body wash, bath foam, liquid hand soap, and bar soap has met with good early success. 
Our Sanex innovations, Sanex Advanced shower oils and body balms, are also driving results. In France, for example, our Sanex body wash share is at 10.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 full points from the year-ago period and the leading brand in the market. 
To keep up the momentum this quarter, we're launching Sanex Soft Freshness underarm protection, filling an important portfolio gap. Freshness is among the top consumer expectations in the category and is highly incremental to our portfolio with a unique formula that slowly releases pleasant fragrances. 
And in fabric conditioner, we're very excited about our new line of Soupline Complete Care, which we expect to further drive our leading share position. At a super-premium price, this new product employs innovative technology to deliver 3 sought-after benefits: irresistible softness, anti-peeling and color protection. The bottle design has outstanding on-shelf impact, and we expect the launch to receive unprecedented support in this category. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business in Latin America remains strong despite macroeconomic challenges in some of our larger markets. Market shares increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, shampoo, bar soaps and liquid cleaners. Our regional toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to almost 76% year-to-date. In Brazil, our share climbed 160 basis points to 73.3% year-to-date, driven by our base businesses such as anti-cavity and Colgate Triple Action, as well as our premium-priced sensitivity business. Our regional manual toothbrush share was up 50 basis points to 41.5% year-to-date. Our regional mouthwash share increased 50 basis points as well to 31.2% year-to-date. 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile all performed well in mouthwash. Brazil share increased 150 basis points to 34.5% due to the very successful launch of Plax Ice Infinity. In bar soaps, where our year-to-date share is over 29%, Protex and Palmolive continue to be the #1 and 2 brands across Latin America. Year-to-date, we've reached record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. In Mexico, innovations such as Palmolive Almond and Omega-3 Oil, supported by impactful shopper marketing programs, continues to drive demand. 
And we're excited about the upcoming innovation grid for this quarter. In Oral Care, we'll be launching a complete regimen behind Colgate Sensitive Pro-Alivio toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash, and we will offer new improved graphics across the line. 
In the kids segment, we're launching Colgate Smiles Minions toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash with the characters kids love. The introduction was timed with the release of the Minions movie across the region.
And to continue the momentum in fabric conditioner, we're launching Suavitel Superior Care. Consumers in this region feel that they're constantly washing clothes, making them look worn-out too quickly. But this new product conditions each individual fiber to reduce wear-out and extend the life of one's clothes. It will be available in our traditional fragrance as well as a new unique and sweet vanilla one. 
Turning then to Asia. Business is solid in this region. While overall leadership regional shares in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes have started the year a bit soft, select countries showed good results. As referenced in the earnings press release, toothpaste shares increased in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and Pakistan. Our manual toothbrush share in India is up 220 basis points to a market-leading 45.7% year-to-date, due in part to innovation in the black bristle segment.  Innovation launched late in the first quarter and coming in the second quarter should help drive results going forward. 
In India, we have just launched Colgate Pain Out. Tooth pain is one of the most common dental problems for Indian consumers, and heretofore, there was no targeted solution for the pain, which can come with no warning. Colgate Pain Out is a targeted spot-based application gel that provides express relief from tooth pain. It's been launched in pharmacies across the country and has met with a very good early success while helping to build Colgate's therapeutic equity in the pharmacy channel. 
The Naturals segment in India has been growing rapidly, and to capitalize on this, we're revitalizing our Colgate Active Salt toothpaste bundle. This comes in 3 variants: original, with lemon and Neem. And also in this segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Clove Essence toothpaste, which provides long-lasting relief from sensitivity with the natural essence of clove. For children in India ages 2 to 5, we're introducing a line of toothpaste, which are mild and safe and have flavors kids love, strawberry and bubble fruit. 
In China, we're relaunching with new graphics and packaging across the toothpaste product portfolio. Colgate 360°, which reduces bacteria for a 360° healthier mouth; Colgate Max Fresh with the 3x freshness shock wave; and Colgate Power White with a wide range of flavor offerings: dazzling mint, sparkling mint, lemon mineral salt, bamboo charcoal mint and jasmine white teeth. In the toothbrush category in India, we've just introduced the Colgate A1 [ph] toothbrush. Now as you know, in this country of over 1.3 billion people, we have a large opportunity to increase penetration and consumption in the lower income segment. These consumers believe that a toothbrush with a broad yet compact head and dense bristles not only cleans effectively but is also durable and longer lasting. Colgate A1 meets this need and is priced at an affordable value price point. So this should help us continue to grow our leading manual toothbrush market share. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales growth in this region was strong, and given the 17% currency headwind, the growth came largely from price as we needed to take significant pricing in certain markets. However, in certain markets such as Russia, we achieved both pricing and volume growth. Innovation has been instrumental in driving our results and there's more to come. In the toothpaste whitening category, we're launching Colgate Optic White Lasting White. Its clinically proven white seal technology makes teeth one shade whiter in 1 week, while preventing stains and it seals out even tough stains from food and drink. 
Across Africa, we're introducing a second tier of pricing for the premium Colgate Optic White line with impactful cracked ice packaging. In the manual toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Developed for the consumer with sensitivity, the brush has ultrasoft bristles and small tuft holes that provide a gentle mouth feel and an ultracompact head that easily navigates in the mouth. 
And in the deodorant category in Russia where we have a solid business, we just launched Lady Speed Stick Bio Protection in March. This line effectively protects against sweat and odor while also caring for your skin health. The product contains a biocontrol complex clinically proven to provide protection while keeping your skin healthy without irritation. And as you would expect, it's being supported by in-store shopper support, which should drive good results. 
Finally, turning to Hill's. Hill's continues to deliver well-balanced mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Business is good domestically and overseas, both in the therapeutic and wellness categories. In the Hill's Prescription Diet line, Metabolic Plus continues to perform well. First launched a year ago, it's now sold in 42 countries. The offering of a complete range of dry food and stews has been supported by extensive sampling and in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools. And as a result, sales of this product in the first quarter were almost 30% ahead of our expectations. 
Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight is also meeting with success. In the first quarter, we added Perfect Weight wet in stew form to the existing dry line. Now as you may recall, this innovation is breakthrough nutrition formulated to help dogs achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 
Another first quarter introduction was Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which offers our new alginate technology in our wellness line to deliver superior-looking, tasty, wet food. This innovation is consistent with the trend of humanization in pet food, and the launch was supported by NCAP placements in some of the pet superstores, at shelf signage, on-pack stickers, sampling in-store and online support and digital media. 
Launching this quarter is our Hill's Prescription Diet Mobility Treat, great-tasting treats that support veterinarians' nutritional recommendation and management of dogs with mobility issues. These are baked treats such as a pet parent would make at home, and form part of an effective nutritional regimen for dogs eating our Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility or Prescription Diet j/d therapeutic pet foods. 
So in summary, we're delighted with our strong start to the year, building on the momentum with which we exited 2015. And as you've heard, we delivered robust organic sales growth, good gross profit margin growth and solid advertising support behind a full range of new products across categories. Our consistent strategies, which you all know well, have yet again stood us in good stead. Colgate people around the world, as always, are working hard to deliver encouraging results. So we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go through the balance of the year. 
And Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to you to start the Q&A session."

Good to see the snap back. Also good to see the gross margin progression. On that front, just a quick question for clarification to make sure we understand how to model this in the forward. Going through the Q, it looks like the biggest swing factor in the margin progression came at that clubbed line, that group line of cost inflation, FX, and obviously you've now added Venezuela deconsolidation in there. We went from a 420 basis point drag to around 130 basis point drag. Can you elaborate on the puts and takes that caused that 290 basis point swing? And ideally, although I'm not sure you're going to answer it, if you could break out the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation."

I frankly would start by reiterating what Bina said, that we are pleased, as you amplified, Jason, with the start to the year. We think it does reflect constancy of strategy and constancy of execution. And pleasingly, the first quarter arrived pretty much as I think we had described to you it would when we were last on the call, which is to say that our top line would grow between 4% and 7% organically, excluding Venezuela, and 5% was entirely consistent with the fourth quarter. We said that we expected our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points, and we're very pleased with the 110 and with the increased advertising behind the innovation and all of that flowing through to the bottom line. I guess, my comment on the gross profit would be, if you look at the shape of our business, gross profit improved across all of our divisions with the exception of Hill's for a known commodity issue. So it is not limited to Latin America. And across Latin America, we took a pretty significant pricing on the back of significant pricing all of 2015 to offset further transaction impact, obviously, again, without Venezuela. And we were pleased in Latin America as we suggested might be the case.   The volume negative that we saw in the fourth quarter rebounded, I think confirming the fact that although there is always a lead lag, we have good consumer loyalty and adoption even at higher price points. So the way I would frame gross margin is, we started at the end of the first quarter saying that our gross margin would expand 75 to 125 basis points for a host of reasons, part of which was Venezuela, but our funding the growth was an important piece of it as well. And again, 110 is pleasing, and as we look forward, I guess, we would say we expect to have gross margin to continue to improve from the first quarter level over the balance of the year and would now say that for the full year, we expect our gross margin to come in towards the high end of our 75 to 125 basis point range, maybe even slightly ahead of that, depending on where transaction headwinds go. We said the last time that we thought gross margin expansion after the plateau over the last 2 to 3 years was an important part of 2016. And clearly, that focus remains in the company. And let me just conclude by saying and perhaps giving you the gross profit roll forward year-on-year. So if you go back to the first quarter of 2015, we had a gross profit margin of 58.9%. We picked up 70 basis points of pricing between restructuring and funding the growth, 140 basis points. And as you know, that builds -- tends to build across the year. Material prices, as you say, 130 basis points negative, which is partly underlying commodity prices and does include a little bit of Venezuela. All other 30 basis points, and so the current year gross profit at 60%. But I think the important point to make is, growth between 4% and 7%, excluding Venezuela, starting well at 5% and gross profit starting well at 110 basis points, and now saying that we expect to be at the high end of the 75 to 125 range, maybe a little bit more."

I know we all focus on weekly shares, but I guess, just putting both in a slightly longer-term context, if you take China over the last 8 years, our share has increased from about 30% to 33% when our principal multinational competitor has declined from 24% to about 12%. And in India, if you take the same time period, our market share has increased from about 48% to the near 54% that we start the year with. And similarly, our principal multinational competitor is down from 20% -- 29% to 21%. So we continue to feel very good about the progress over time we are making. In both cases, let's start with India, in both cases, the short-term share impact comes from local competitors with heightened promotional activity. That is also the case in China. In both cases, we went through the innovation and go-to-market plans that are already being adopted in India and China, to take corrective action against that short-term slowdown. And we feel good about making progress over the balance of the year."

As Bina said, up meaningfully on the second half of last year and in line with a strong first quarter of 2015. Obviously, behind a broad and deep array of innovation that we have coming to our markets around the world starting in the first quarter, but of course, coming for the rest of the year as well. And our current plan would see us increasing our advertising spend year-on-year, both absolutely and as a percentage to sales. That is what we said the last time we spoke and we remain in that position. It would not be a Colgate earnings call if I weren't to emphasize the point that we continue to balance this investment behind our brand health and the innovation we have with the very compelling and broad array of in-store activity that we are able to deploy. And so in fact, our commercial investment continues to be up as well in the first quarter, which is to say, the money that we are investing for in-store activity has increased, and is on top of the increased ratio of spend on traditional advertising versus the fourth quarter of last year. The other thing I would say in terms of efficiency of advertising, because we are seeing it becoming quite a meaningful component of how we go to market a lot more, and we spent quite a lot of time showcasing this in CAGNY, for those of you that were there or have read the transcript, a lot about consumer engagement, particularly given the changing demographics in the world, is now with digital advertising. Digital advertising is more efficient than the traditional print, television, radio, billboard type of advertising. And interestingly, to the point in Asia, a significant part of the investment we make these days, indeed approaching 50% in the case of China is direct engagement with the consumer through digital vehicles. I call that out simply because it is an increasing -- it is increasingly the way we engage with consumers and it's a more effective and efficient way of doing so."

And indeed, that is the way it has played out in the first quarter. And the first quarter has seen a fairly significant headwind for the average of the quarter in terms of foreign exchange, although, as you rightly say, easing as the quarter ended. So when you look at foreign exchange per se, our current planning sees a lessening of the headwind as the year unfolds. Indeed, yes, a lessening of the headwinds sequentially quarter by quarter, which is a good thing. And we will continue to take the pricing that we need to take to offset any transaction impact. But yes, consistent with the comments we made at the beginning of the year, pricing will be less of a factor in 2016 than it was in 2015."

Secondly, without dwelling on it, foreign exchange plays a role in the aggregation of share. And thirdly, our volume shares continue to perform quite nicely.

So the marketplace promotional intensity, not tracing to any particular competitor, is as it has been in Europe. There's really nothing new there. We continue to operate very well in that environment, as Bina mentioned, with our market share progress. And I think that's very healthy. So that's the way I'd answer that. North America, there is always a component in North America when you remember that the couponing for the trial of new products is covered in the trade spending. That is a factor in North America. And so as we have heightened innovation activity, you will see more of the trial generating couponing, which translates through into price. And in both cases, as the year unfolds, we are expecting that negative pricing to ameliorate somewhat. Pleasingly of course, gross margins, in both the case of North America and Europe, were up for the quarter and we expect them to be up for the year as well. So as we think about our marketing mix and where we make our investments, you look at the share, you look at the gross margin progress, you look at the top line progress, we think we're managing that balance in a responsible way."

So there is, in these numbers, no destocking, refilling of inventory. These are true volume numbers in Latin America, and we feel good about that. We do think, and this is what we tried to intimate on the fourth quarter when people were a little bit concerned and probing on the negative volume in Latin America, that there would be a little bit of a lag, given the significant pricing we took in the fourth quarter, for volume to bounce back. But I think we were quite clear that we did expect 2016 to be a year where our organic would shave more to the volume than to the pricing. So that's what I think we are seeing in Latin America.

And in China, it's not doom and gloom. Some concerns, but not the headlines that we read every day. Conversely, in Russia and Brazil, the consumer sentiment, as we have said before, is more negative. So I think the way we are thinking about it is more in terms of the consumers' consumption behavior as we measure it in those markets, and that seems to suggest that we will be going forward with categories growing, in general terms, mid-single digits on a local currency basis.

And that's probably the last scale divestment we have done and probably would be doing."

Also, it sounds like maybe their innovation capability is improving. Ian, could you talk about whether being such a big online market -- I know it's not a big percentage of your sales now, but in many other categories, online is growing like crazy. Is this making up a pricing environment that's more difficult? Is it leading to more local competition gaining share?

It has nothing to do with digital, although I will come back to digital. It is the plethora of local brands, which tends to be more brick-and-mortar activity with promoters in-store who essentially rugby tackle you when you walk into the store in order to persuade you. I would say it's not particularly innovation driven for the plethora of local brands. There is one local competitor, Unibail, that does a good job at a premium price point. We've made the point before that we had innovation and R&D capability on the ground. We have just moved to the marketplace with a new natural line, which is very tailored to the Chinese consumer. We have advertising that is very different to the advertising that we use around the world in terms of engaging with the Chinese consumer. Now coming back to the Internet, we see this as an enormous opportunity in China. You're right. It is a relatively low percentage of sales in the categories in which we do business. Our business has been booming over the last 3 years. We have been growing market share, but we spent a lot of time when we were in Asia, particularly in China, addressing this topic. And we see Internet -- you think of the Tencents and the Alibabas, we see Internet as a very rich area for future growth in China for us. But that is separate and apart from the sort of brick-and-mortar price promotion of the plethora of ""cheapy"" brands."

Yes, Latin America is a very changeable economic arena in our world, and you can go back to the '80s and perhaps see many companies be hurt by economic events and perhaps reduced focus on Latin America or even withdrawal from Latin America. We, at that time, stayed and we learned how to operate in these volatile environments. And frankly, a lot of it starts with pricing to make sure you have a margin that allows you to invest to grow a brand. I think if you come to Brazil, the position we have with 74% share in toothpaste, leadership share in toothbrushes and jockeying for leadership in mouth rinse, Colgate is an enormously well-trusted brand in Brazil. And we bring significant innovation to the Brazilian marketplace. Interestingly, innovation that is not necessarily cheap, but which the consumer sees value in. We're also very disciplined in terms of our go to market. To the question asked earlier, we make sure that we bring to the marketplace the volume of product that the consumer is purchasing, so we don't create an inventory dislocation that you then have to unwind. So the combination of all of that has seen the share grow, and indeed, quite pleasingly, volume grow as well."

So whether you're multinational or local, you're going to get the impact eventually. But then, what you see is, over time, the pricing in the marketplace move up. So I would say the general experience is you have to be a little bit patient sometimes. But eventually the patience sees the market rise. There is certainly in most markets no retailer resistance because they understand the concept of translation-driven inflation very well to the extent that transaction is not as significant as it has been in 2015. As I said earlier, our expectation is that we will be taking lesser pricing this year than last. But over half of the pricing we came into 2016 with was rollover pricing, even excluding Venezuela. So I would say that's the way to profile it. Interestingly, if you focus your innovation on bringing benefits, think of whitening as we have done, you can actually charge a meaningful premium price in a category, lift the category and bring the consumer with you. And obviously, I think it's the duty of marketing companies to find those consumer needs that you can really deliver against at a price point wherein they see value."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
Happily, the momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter with good organic sales growth within our targeted range of 4% to 7% and as compared to the strong quarter of last year. Gross profit margin accelerated nicely, which allowed us to increase worldwide advertising as a percent of sales. 
And as you will year in more detail, our market share is our strong. New products continue to play important role in our strategy. Innovation across categories have helped fuel growth around the world And our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Our balance sheet is wrong and the so is our cash generation. 
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with ongoing and sometimes volatile currency headwinds. So in light of this, we're particularly pleased with the results. 
Just a quick housekeeping note before we get into the divisions. As was mentioned in this morning's 8-K filing, as a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe, South Pacific and Asia operating segment. Beginning this quarter, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific operating segment. There's no impact on historical company results overall. For informational purposes, historical geographic segments and geographic sales growth information conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We're pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Thompson main and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares. And as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. 
Our oral care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in latest read. New products supported by impactful marketing campaigns and in-store activity had been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the superpremium segment with year-to-date sales increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016, increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points.
In addition to equity driver, such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we link to Colgate Total to National Women's health week. Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio, including multiple toothpaste offerings, as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach. Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White Platinum Lasting White variance was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date and in the second quarter, reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period.
Colgate 360° toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate 360° degree in our health whitening toothbrush with Spira polishing bristles and stay in racing cap. Market share for the Colgate 360-degree toothbrush ratios growth from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through June.
Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360° franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the new Colgate 360° Total Advance 4 Zone Manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new toothbrush feature the high tech ergonomic design and a tongue-in-cheek cleaner with longer rubber knobs than any previous Colgate 360° toothbrush. It's specifically designed to great the 4 zones of your math, your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via comprehensive activation in key retailers. 
And in Personal Care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter, we launched so soft killer foaming hand soap. The simple general formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no Dyer alcohol. And we told you last quarter about So Soft Luminous oil body wash, which comes in 2 variants, avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and BNE. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and BNE there and has been the #1 soft body wash parent at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks. Let's turn to Europe.
Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners.
While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in individual countries, as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and Gaba brands. And you may recall, we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen, which has met with great success. Original overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the nearest competitor. 
In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period. Our year-to-date body wash shares is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1% with the gains coming from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You recall we recently launched a range of Sanex products, including body wash for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets, France, Spain and the U.K, our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date. 
Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3% to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over 1 point from 47.4% to 48.5% with the most recently lead at 50.1% and this in the face of continued discompetitive activity.
More innovation is found to the back half of this year. And in other parts of the but the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optix with a revitalized graphics and improved formula, which is 3x more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth. 
A new Gaba product is there a peridont expert, a clinically proven daily use toothpaste which increases gum resistance periodontitis. This offering seals the gap in our portfolio. 
And in Personal Care, we hope to continue the momentum with the body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept, which has been proven in geographies. As I'm sure you recall, this range of body wash has a high density, creamy formula offered in vanilla pleasure, chocolate passion, peach delight and strawberry touch. New sweet packaging provides a premium look, high-quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact. 
Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market, as it is the first range of products, body washes, shampoo and underarm protection, which is truly focused on men's health, skin health. 
Turning then to Latin America. The strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories. In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil, our share is at a record 73.3% with the most recent lead at 73.5%. 
In the highly competitive whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash had been supported by a new and strong working campaign designed to make you shine.
In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date. 
In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our share of 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the Personal Care category, in Brazil, we launched Protex pro Trotter with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap offering moisturizing sensation, as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known. 
The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as a leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil. 
Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now our 2 new toothpaste, the first, price and premium range as a category, Colgate Total Professional Daily Repair, creates the shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel demineralization and prevents teeth and gum problem. The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro-polishing particles provides extra widening. It removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness. 
Along with the triple action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action whitening toothbrush. To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex For Men 3 on 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers 3 benefits. Besides eliminating 9.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin. It prepares the skin for soft shade and it can be use as a shampoo, leading men's hair clean with a masculine fragrance. 
Turning then to Asia South Pacific. Results was somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strengths. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6% with the most recent lead at 64.6%. Lower price offering, such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence, as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive, contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process we're introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal Toothpaste in that market. 
In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for the balance of the year. In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients. And we told you last quarter about 2 toothpaste initiatives: Colgate Active Salt with means and Colgate sensitive with global essence. 
A third toothpaste launched in this order under to Bakos sub brand is Colgate call quite a whole. The positioning is a toothpaste packed with the goodness of natural ingredients help keep dental problems away. In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal.
Now flush is strong but growing category across the region. Our regional shares up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum this quarter in India, we are launching Colgate Plax spicy fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market share is strong. 
In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses: Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8%. But in the most recent period, our share is at 28.1%. And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points with the most recently at 50.6%.
In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date with the most recent lead at 39.2%. Now we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste for its launch in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON 12 complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, will be rolled out across of these regions supported by media and key visuals in store to communicate the benefits. 
Similarly from other regions, we will launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief repair and prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivities from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new Colgate ulti-herb ginseng, which adds ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate ulti herbs toothpaste launch previously. 
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line and shower gels with improved graphics. And in addition, we've added 2 new variants, mint and coconut.
Turning to health. As with the Colgate businesses, health continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over 1 year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry instills has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries. Building on this solid metabolic plus platform, in May of this year, we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus urinary stress for cats, with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems, which are very common in cats. The product is now available in 13 countries across the North America and Europe.
Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth largest therapeutic food category in dollar sales for pets. In 2016, we have 2 major initiatives in this area: Prescription Diet Dem defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet CD. 
Prescription Diet Dem defense is held first and only nutrition with 60 [ph] guard complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes in dogs. Now in the U.S. and Europe and would be rolled out across the rest of the world. The science was presented both at a global dorm symposium in April in California and at the World Congress Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness of our key thought leaders. 
Our prescription diet CD upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known to support skin and coat NGI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variance for the rapidly growing small dog population. Innovations across our science diet platform continues to do well. 
In addition to our Science Diet footprint and Science Diet healthy cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our Science Diet urinary hairball control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North America. It's now the #1 wet variant for Science Diet. 
In Europe, we have an online quiz and game, as well as videos for the products to generate interest and trial. 
So in summary then, we're pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings program, as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are delivering a healthy growth profit for its margin increase.

Asia, as you",590,"Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess, overall, I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2%, although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed. I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue, as I will describe. And then I can come back and talk about our market shares, both overall and respective to China. So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace. 2 things, Number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up. And as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid single-digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is the shift of business from brick-and-mortar to online. Online showing very sharp growth. Indeed, our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part, because of backdoor selling from the brick-and-mortar retailers, which distorted pricing in the market and build inventory with wholesalers. Now we have seen in that before as you know, and we are seeing it again. And we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of the this year. But it will continue for a little while.
In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world. And I would say on the world that our market share, in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down, but that is also due with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share, on a constant currency basis, is up. And our market share in volume terms is up around the world. In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing 2 periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about last time, which is premium innovation, to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace.
So we don't think we're in balance from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, you to buy all has been flat in market share terms for the past 6 periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we seem, it is in this temporal adjustment again of a slowdown in consumption, which is picked backup but perhaps, more substantial ship overtime move from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. Again, if they consumption is mid single-digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping, the consumption levels will not change. So something to work through, but we don't think substantive and we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward."

Well, we're quite optimistic on Latin America, which maybe a contrarian thing to say, largely based on the relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products. Now the Mexican market share is still north of 80, which is a very respectable place to be. And we quoted the Brazilian share now approaching 74%. I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that the pricing -- that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impacts on costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that, that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year. And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares. And as I said earlier, our market share is not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume driven than pricing driven. And indeed, we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within in the 4 to 7 range that we are staying with, it will be more volume driven than pricing driven for the entire year. So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing, which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time, continue with the install work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we're very comfortable with our approach. And that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that by our products in that part of the world."

Just some perspective there."

They did, we did not see that you will remember during the subprime period, and if consumers find themselves cash stretch, they tend to buy us more sites before they come back to the payday we can. So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid single-digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time. But these foreign exchange trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil. And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill into one geography and one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly, again, even though this may continue to be contrarian in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores a good ROI.

The shopping consumer in Latin America is perhaps one of the most educated on the planet in terms of the vagaries of foreign exchange and what that means for a shopping basket. So -- and the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil, for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the group that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange move. I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes you're talking taking pricing, but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time, they have opportunities in terms of the different sizes. We have to buy at different price points and therefore, mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do, do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps, what might -- you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio. So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket.

The prior-year gross profit was 58.3. We got the benefit 110 basis points of the pricing. We had between funding the growth and restructuring, restructuring modest in gross profit, as you know, 190 basis points favorable. Material prices were a headwind of 110 basis points, nothing in leather. And I guess, 60.2, which is the 190 basis points. Now as we think about that for the balance of the year, I mean, first pleasingly, although these pleasing moments are quickly behind you. But pleasingly, this is the second back-to-back quarter now we've been above 60 in gross margin, which as you know, was a company goal. Indeed, the second edge slightly up on the first. But if you look at our gross profit for the first half of the year, it's up 150 basis points, 1.5 points. So as we, as you think about the balance of the year, I guess what we would say is our expectation is that our gross margin increase for the second half of the year will be around the same level as the first half, maybe even a little bit higher. And to the primary driver of that of course, is transaction headwinds will start to lessen as of the foreign exchange comparisons are on other event in now will improve year upon year."

I mean, I think whatever we do on Hill's, whatever we have done on Hill's, we are always extremely focus as a matter of strategy on the nutrition the diet provide. doesn't matter whether it's a prescription product, a science product or even our Ideal Balance product. I think the thing you might want to read into it is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product just the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet to change the composition of the ingredients in those products, to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition of that they're looking for. That was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a natural pure play. So Ideal Balance is doing okay. But I would say our major shift has been to make sure, from a dietary composition point of view, that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And of course, in making that change, have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the paired has provided is completely and change in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it. And all of the innovation that are being talked about on the Prescription Diet side, seems seen with the way to products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways, given the different positionings of each of those 3 segments of the business."

It implies that your pricing, your portfolio is down almost 20% in aggregate since that time.

But as I think about how that flows through the margins, I'm assuming that, that premieralization has been beneficial to margins. But if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, special by segment, you typically call out spanning the growth then all in it's kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefits or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing, that mix benefit?

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
Happily, the momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter with good organic sales growth within our targeted range of 4% to 7% and as compared to the strongest quarter of last year. Gross profit margin accelerated nicely, which allowed us to increase worldwide advertising as a percent of sales.
And as you will hear in more detail, our market shares are strong. New products continue to play an important role in our strategy. Innovation across categories has helped fuel growth around the world. And our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Our balance sheet is strong and so is our cash generation.
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with ongoing and sometimes volatile currency headwinds. So in light of this, we're particularly pleased with the results.
Just a quick housekeeping note before we get into the divisions. As was mentioned in this morning's 8-K filing, as a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe, South Pacific and Asia operating segment. Beginning this quarter, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific operating segment. There's no impact on historical company results overall. For informational purposes, recast historical geographic segments and geographic sales growth information conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We're pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Tom's of Maine and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares. And as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners.
Our Oral Care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in the latest read. New products supported by impactful marketing campaigns and in-store activity had been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the superpremium segment with year-to-date shares increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016, increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points. In addition to equity drivers such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we linked Colgate Total to National Women's Health Week.
Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio, including multiple toothpaste offerings as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach. Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White Platinum Lasting White variants was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date and in the second quarter, reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period.
Colgate 360° toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush with spiral polishing bristles and stain erasing cups. Market share for the Colgate 360° toothbrush range has grown from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through June.
Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360° franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the new Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new toothbrush features a high tech ergonomic design and a tongue and cheek cleaner with longer rubber knobs of any previous Colgate 360° -- than any previous Colgate 360° toothbrush. It's specifically designed to clean the 4 zones of your mouth: your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via comprehensive shopper activation in key retailers.
And in Personal Care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter, we launched Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap. The simple gentle formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no dye or alcohol. And we told you last quarter about Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, which comes in 2 variants: avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and peony. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and peony variant has been the #1 Softsoap body wash variant at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks.
Let's turn to Europe. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners.
While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in individual countries, as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and GABA brands. And you may recall, we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen, which has met with great success. Our regional overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the nearest competitor.
In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period. Our year-to-date body wash share is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1%, with gains coming from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You'll recall we recently launched a range of Sanex products, including body wash for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets, France, Spain and the U.K., our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date.
Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3% to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over 1 point from 47.4% to 48.5%, with the most recent read at 50.1%, and this in the face of continued stiff competitive activity.
More innovation is planned to the back half of this year. And in other parts of the world, the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optic with revitalized graphics and an improved formula, which is 3x more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth.
A new GABA product is meridol's Parodont Expert, a clinically proven daily use toothpaste which increases gum resistance against periodontitis. This offering fills the gap in our portfolio.
And in Personal Care, we hope to continue the momentum in body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept which has been proven in other geographies. As I'm sure you'll recall, this range of body washes has a high density, creamy formula offered in Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch. New sleeve packaging provides a premium look, high-quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact.
Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market as it is the first range of products, body washes, shampoo and underarm protection which is truly focused on men's health -- skin health.
Turning then to Latin America. The strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories. In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil, our share is at a record 73.3%, with the most recent read at 73.5%.
In the highly competitive whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash has been supported by a new and strong marketing campaign, ""Designed to Make You Shine.""
In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date.
In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our share up 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the Personal Care category, in Brazil, we launched Protex Pro-Hidrata with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap, offering moisturizing sensation as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known.
The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as a leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil.
Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now are 2 new toothpastes. The first, priced at the premium range of the category, Colgate Total Professional Daily Repair, creates a shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel demineralization and prevents teeth and gum problems. The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro-polishing particles provides extra whitening. It removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness. Along with the Triple Action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action Whitening toothbrush.
To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex for Men 3 in 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers 3 benefits. Besides eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin, it prepares the skin for a soft shave and it can be used as a shampoo, leaving men's hair clean with a masculine fragrance.
Turning then to Asia/South Pacific. Results were somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strengths. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6%, with the most recent read at 64.6%. Lower priced offerings such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process of introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal toothpaste in that market.
In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for the balance of the year. In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients. And we told you last quarter about 2 toothpaste initiatives: Colgate Active Salt with Neem and Colgate Sensitive with Clove Essence. A third toothpaste launched in this quarter under the Cibaca sub-brand is Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti. The positioning is a toothpaste ""packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away."" In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal.
Mouthwash is a small but growing category across the region. Our regional share is up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum this quarter in India, we are launching Colgate Plax Spicy Fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn.
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market shares are strong.
In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses: Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8%. But in the most recent period, our share is at 28.1%. And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points, with the most recent read at 50.6%.
In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 39.2%. Now we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste, first launched in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON12 Complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth will be rolled out across this region, supported by media and key visuals in-store to communicate the benefits.
Similarly drawing from other regions, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivity from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new  Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, which adds ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste launched previously.
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels with improved graphics. And in addition, we've added 2 new variants, mint and coconut.
Turning to Hill's. As with the Colgate businesses, Hill's continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over a year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry and stews has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries. Building on the solid Metabolic Plus platform, in May of this year, we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Urinary Stress for cats, with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline lower urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems, which are very common in cats. The product is now available in 13 countries across North America and Europe.
Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth-largest therapeutic food category in dollar sales for pets. In 2016, we have 2 major initiatives in this area: Prescription Diet Derm Defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet z/d.
Prescription Diet Derm Defense is Hill's first and only nutrition with HistaGuard Complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's now in the U.S. and Europe and would be rolled out across the rest of the world. The science was presented both at a Global Derm Symposium in April in California and at the World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness among key thought leaders.
Our Prescription Diet z/d upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known to support skin and coat and GI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variant for the rapidly growing small dog population. Innovations across our Science Diet platform continue to do well.
In addition to our Science Diet Perfect Weight and Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North America. It's now the #1 wet variant for Science Diet.
In Europe, we have an online quiz and game as well as videos for the product to generate interest and trial.
So in summary then, we're very pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are delivering a healthy gross profit margin increase. Around the world, Colgate people are executing our focused strategy. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about what is yet to come. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we go through the balance of the year.
And now, Angela, I should like to turn it over to questions."

Asia, as you",588,"Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess, overall, I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2%, although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed. I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue, as I will describe, and then I can come back and talk about our market shares, both overall and respective to China. So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace. 2 things, number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up. And as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid-single digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is the shift of business from brick-and-mortar to online. Online showing very sharp growth. Indeed, our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part, because of backdoor selling from the brick-and-mortar retailers, which distorted pricing in the market and built inventory with wholesalers. Now we have seen that before, as you know, and we are seeing it again. And we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, but it will continue for a little while.
In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world. And I would say on the world that our market share, in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down, but that is all to do with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share, on a constant currency basis, is up. And our market share in volume terms is up around the world. In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing 2 periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about the last time, which is premium innovation, to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace.
So we don't think we're imbalanced from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, Yunnan Baiyao, has been flat in market share terms for the past 6 periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we see, it is this temporal adjustment again of slowdown in consumption, which has picked back up, but perhaps a more substantive shift over time move from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. Again, if the consumption is mid-single digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping, the consumption levels will not change. So something to work through, but we don't think substantive, and we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward."

Well, we are quite optimistic on Latin America, which may be a contrarian thing to say, largely based on the relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products. Now the Mexican market share is still north of 80%, which is a fairly respectable place to be. And we quoted the Brazilian share now approaching 74%. I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that the pricing -- that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impact on costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that, that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year. And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares. And as I said earlier, our market shares are not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume-driven than pricing-driven. And indeed, we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within the 4% to 7% range that we are staying with, it will be more volume-driven than pricing-driven for the entire year. So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing, which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time continue with the in-store work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we are very comfortable with our approach. And that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products in that part of the world."

The -- on Brazil, I think we take the view, as many others have announced, that we see this continuing for the balance of the year. We have not seen trading down in terms of our portfolio. Indeed, we did not see that. You will remember during the subprime period, and if consumers find themselves cash stretched, they tend to buy a smaller size before they come back to the payday weekend. So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid-single-digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time, but these foreign exchange trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil. And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill in to one geography and one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly, again, even though this may continue to be contrarian, in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores and a good ROI. And we will continue to do that if that -- in a balanced way to build our brands."

Relative to this pricing notion, I mean, our price was greater than our volume in this -- the second quarter for the reasons that I have mentioned.

The shopping consumer in Latin America is perhaps one of the most educated on the planet in terms of the vagaries of foreign exchange and what that means for a shopping basket. So -- and the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil, for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the good that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange move. I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes, you're talking taking pricing, but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time. They have opportunities in terms of the different sizes. We have to buy at different price points and therefore, mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do, do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps what might -- you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio. So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket.

I mean, I think whatever we do on Hill's, whatever we have done on Hill's, we are always extremely focused as a matter of strategy on the nutrition the diets provide. Doesn't matter whether it is a prescription product, a science product or even our Ideal Balance product. I think the thing you might want to read into is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product, just the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet to change the composition of the ingredients in those products to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition that they're looking for. And that was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a natural pure play. So Ideal Balance is doing okay, but I would say our major shift has been to make sure from a dietary composition point of view that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And of course, in making that change, have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the pet is provided is completely unchanged in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it. And all of the innovation that Bina talked about on the Prescription Diet side, as you've seen with the weight products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways given the different positionings of each of those 3 segments of the business."

If I think about Europe, where you see pricing down again 3% this quarter, which I understand is a well-documented trend. If I go back to 2009 and just index your portfolio to 100, multiply it through the reported pricing, right? It implies that your pricing, your portfolio is down like almost 20% in aggregate since that time. And obviously, there's been a big continuous mix component, I'm assuming, as you roll in new premium innovation that's helped offset that in the volume line. But as I think about how that flows through to margins, I'm assuming that, that premiumization has been beneficial to margins. But if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, especially by segment, you typically call out funding the growth and then all-in is kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefits or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing, that mix benefit? Or is it somehow contributing to funding the growth as it relates to your margin drivers?"

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
Happily, the momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter with good organic sales growth within our targeted range of 4% to 7% and as compared to the strongest quarter of last year. Gross profit margin accelerated nicely, which allowed us to increase worldwide advertising as a percent to sales.
And as you will hear in more detail, our market shares are strong. New products continue to play an important role in our strategy. Innovation across categories has helped fuel growth around the world. And our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Our balance sheet is strong and so is our cash generation.
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with ongoing and sometimes volatile currency headwinds. So in light of this, we're particularly pleased with the results.
Just a quick housekeeping note before we get into the divisions. As was mentioned in this morning's 8-K filing, as a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe, South Pacific and Asia operating segments. Beginning this quarter, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific operating segment. There's no impact on historical company results overall. For informational purposes, recast historical geographic segments and geographic sales growth information conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We're pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Tom's of Maine and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares. And as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners.
Our Oral Care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in the latest read. New products supported by impactful marketing campaigns and in-store activity have been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the superpremium segment with year-to-date shares increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016, increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points. In addition to equity drivers such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we linked Colgate Total to National Women's Health Week.
Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio, including multiple toothpaste offerings as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach. Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White Platinum Lasting White variants was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date and in the second quarter, reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period.
Colgate 360° toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush with spiral polishing bristles and stain erasing cups. Market share for the Colgate 360° toothbrush range has grown from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through June.
Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360° franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the new Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new toothbrush features a high tech ergonomic design and a tongue and cheek cleaner with longer rubber nubs than any previous Colgate 360° -- than any previous Colgate 360° toothbrush. It's specifically designed to clean the 4 zones of your mouth: your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via comprehensive shopper activation in key retailers.
And in Personal Care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter, we launched Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap. The simple gentle formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no dye or alcohol. And we told you last quarter about Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, which comes in 2 variants: avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and peony. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and peony variant has been the #1 Softsoap body wash variant at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks.
Let's turn to Europe. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners.
While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in individual countries, as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and GABA brands. And you may recall, we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen, which has met with great success. Our regional overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the nearest competitor.
In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period. Our year-to-date body wash share is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1%, with gains coming from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You'll recall we recently launched a range of Sanex products, including body wash for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets, France, Spain and the U.K., our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date.
Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3% to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over 1 point from 47.4% to 48.5%, with the most recent read at 50.1%, and this in the face of continued stiff competitive activity.
More innovation is planned for the back half of this year. And as in other parts of the world, the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optic with revitalized graphics and an improved formula which is 3x more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth.
A new GABA product is meridol's Parodont Expert, a clinically proven daily use toothpaste which increases gum resistance against periodontitis. This offering fills a gap in our portfolio.
And in Personal Care, we hope to continue the momentum in body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept which has been proven in other geographies. As I'm sure you'll recall, this range of body washes has a high density, creamy formula offered in Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch. New sleeve packaging provides a premium look, high-quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact.
Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market as it is the first range of products -- body washes, shampoo and underarm protection -- which is truly focused on men's health -- skin health.
Turning then to Latin America. The strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories. In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil, our share is at a record 73.3%, with the most recent read at 73.5%.
In the highly-competitive whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash has been supported by a new and strong marketing campaign, ""Designed to Make You Shine.""
In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date.
In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our share up 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the Personal Care category, in Brazil, we launched Protex Pro-Hidrata with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap, offering moisturizing sensation as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known.
The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as the leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil.
Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now are 2 new toothpastes. The first, priced at the premium range of the category, Colgate Total Professional Daily Repair, creates a shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel demineralization and prevents teeth and gum problems. The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro-polishing particles provides extra whitening. It removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness. Along with the Triple Action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action Whitening toothbrush.
To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex for Men 3 in 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers 3 benefits. Besides eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin, it prepares the skin for a soft shave and it can be used as a shampoo, leaving men's hair clean with a masculine fragrance.
Turning then to Asia/South Pacific. Results were somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strengths. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6%, with the most recent read at 64.6%. Lower priced offerings such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process of introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal toothpaste in that market.
In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovations slated for the balance of the year. In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients. And we told you last quarter about 2 toothpaste initiatives: Colgate Active Salt with Neem and Colgate Sensitive with Clove Essence. A third toothpaste launched in this quarter under the Cibaca sub-brand is Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti. The positioning is a toothpaste ""packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away."" In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal.
Mouthwash is a small but growing category across the region. Our regional share is up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum this quarter in India, we are launching Colgate Plax Spicy Fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn.
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market shares are strong.
In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses: Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8%. But in the most recent period, our share is at 28.1%. And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points, with the most recent read at 50.6%.
In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 39.2%. Now we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste, first launched in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON12 Complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria, while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, will be rolled out across this region, supported by media and key visuals in-store to communicate the benefits.
Similarly drawing from other regions, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivity from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, which adds ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste launched previously.
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels with improved graphics. And in addition, we've added 2 new variants, mint and coconut.
Turning to Hill's. As with the Colgate businesses, Hill's continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over a year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry and stews has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries. Building on the solid Metabolic Plus platform, in May of this year, we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Urinary Stress for cats, with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline lower urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems, which are very common in cats. The product is now available in 13 countries across North America and Europe.
Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth-largest therapeutic food category in dollar sales for pets. In 2016, we have 2 major initiatives in this area: Prescription Diet Derm Defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet z/d.
Prescription Diet Derm Defense is Hill's first and only nutrition with HistaGuard Complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's now in the U.S. and Europe and would be rolled out across the rest of the world. The science was presented both at a Global Derm Symposium in April in California and at the World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness among key thought leaders.
Our Prescription Diet z/d upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known to support skin and coat and GI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variant for the rapidly growing small dog population. Innovations across our Science Diet platform continue to do well.
In addition to our Science Diet Perfect Weight and Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North America. It's now the #1 wet variant for Science Diet.
In Europe, we have an online quiz and game as well as videos for the product to generate interest and trial.
So in summary then, we're very pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are delivering a healthy gross profit margin increase. Around the world, Colgate people are executing our focused strategies. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about what is yet to come. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we go through the balance of the year.
And now, Angela, I should like to turn it over to questions."

I guess, overall, I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you",588,"Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess, overall, I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2%, although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed. I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue, as I will describe, and then I can come back and talk about market shares, both overall and respective to China. So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace. 2 things. Number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up. And as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid-single digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is the shift of business from brick-and-mortar to online. Online showing very sharp growth. Indeed, our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part, because of backdoor selling from the brick-and-mortar retailers, which distorted pricing in the market and built inventory with wholesalers. Now we have seen that before, as you know, and we are seeing it again. And we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, but it will continue for a little while. In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world. And I would say on the world that our market share, in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down, but that is all to do with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share, on a constant currency basis, is up. And our market share in volume terms is up around the world. In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing 2 periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about the last time, which is premium innovation, to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace. So we don't think we're imbalanced from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, Yunnan Baiyao, has been flat in market share terms for the past 6 periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we see, it is this temporal adjustment again of slowdown in consumption, which has picked back up, but perhaps a more substantive shift over time -- move from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. Again, if the consumption is mid-single digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping; the consumption levels will not change. So something to work through, but we don't think substantive, and we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward."

Well, we are quite optimistic on Latin America, which may be a contrarian thing to say, largely based on the relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products. Now the Mexican market share is still north of 80%, which is a fairly respectable place to be. And we quoted the Brazilian share at now approaching 74%. I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that the pricing -- that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impact of costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that, that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year. And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares. And as I said earlier, our market shares are not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume-driven than pricing-driven. And indeed, we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within the 4% to 7% range that we are staying with, it will be more volume-driven than pricing-driven for the entire year. So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing, which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time continue with the in-store work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we are very comfortable with our approach. And that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products in that part of the world."

The -- on Brazil, I think we take the view, as many others have announced, that we see this continuing for the balance of the year. We have not seen trading down in terms of our portfolio. Indeed, we did not see that. You will remember during the subprime period, and if consumers find themselves cash-stretched, they tend to buy a smaller size before they come back to the payday weekend. So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid-single-digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time, but these foreign exchange trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil. And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill in to one geography and one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly, again, even though this may continue to be contrarian, in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores and a good ROI. And we will continue to do that if that -- in a balanced way to build our brands."

Thanks, Jonathan. The -- Latin America is an interesting part of the world. The shopping consumer in Latin America is perhaps one of the most educated on the planet in terms of the vagaries of foreign exchange and what that means for a shopping basket. So -- and the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil, for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the goods that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange moves. I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes, you're talking taking pricing, but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively-modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time. They have opportunities in terms of the different sizes we have, to buy at different price points and therefore mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do, do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps what might -- you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio. So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket. So that's the way I would answer it, Jon."

Doesn't matter whether it is a prescription product, a science product or even our Ideal Balance product. I think the thing you might want to read into it is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product, this the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet, to change the composition of the ingredients in those products to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value, thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition that they're looking for. And that was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a natural pure play. So Ideal Balance is doing okay, but I would say our major shift has been to make sure from a dietary composition point of view that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And of course, in making that change, have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the pet is provided is completely unchanged in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it. And all of the innovation that Bina talked about on the Prescription Diet side, as you've seen with the weight products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways given the different positionings of each of those 3 segments of the business."

But just as I'm asking about how you define things in your reporting. If I think about Europe, where you see pricing down again 3% this quarter, which I understand is a well-documented trend. If I go back to 2009 and just index your portfolio to 100, multiply it through reported pricing, right? It implies that your pricing -- your portfolio is down like almost 20% in aggregate since that time. And obviously, there's been a big continuous mix component, I'm assuming, as you roll in new premium innovation that's helped offset that in the volume line. But as I think about how that flows through to margins, I'm assuming that, that premiumization has been beneficial to margins. But if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, especially by segment, you typically call out funding the growth and then all-in kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefits or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing, that mix benefit? Or is it somehow contributing to funding the growth as it relates to your margin drivers?"

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
Happily, the momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter with good organic sales growth within our targeted range of 4% to 7% and as compared to the strongest quarter of last year. Gross profit margin accelerated nicely, which allowed us to increase worldwide advertising as a percent to sales.
And as you will hear in more detail, our market shares are strong. New products continue to play an important role in our strategy. Innovation across categories has helped fuel growth around the world. And our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Our balance sheet is strong and so is our cash generation.
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with ongoing and sometimes volatile currency headwinds. So in light of this, we're particularly pleased with the results.
Just a quick housekeeping note before we get into the divisions. As was mentioned in this morning's 8-K filing, as a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe, South Pacific and Asia operating segments. Beginning this quarter, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific operating segment. There's no impact on historical company results overall. For informational purposes, recast historical geographic segments and geographic sales growth information conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We're pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Tom's of Maine and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares. And as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners.
Our Oral Care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in the latest read. New products supported by impactful marketing campaigns and in-store activity have been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the superpremium segment with year-to-date shares increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016, increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points. In addition to equity drivers such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we linked Colgate Total to National Women's Health Week.
Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio, including multiple toothpaste offerings as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach. Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White Platinum Lasting White variants was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date and in the second quarter, reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period.
Colgate 360° toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush with spiral polishing bristles and stain erasing cups. Market share for the Colgate 360° toothbrush range has grown from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through June.
Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360° franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the new Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new toothbrush features a high tech ergonomic design and a tongue and cheek cleaner with longer rubber nubs than any previous Colgate 360° -- than any previous Colgate 360° toothbrush. It's specifically designed to clean the 4 zones of your mouth: your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via comprehensive shopper activation in key retailers.
And in Personal Care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter, we launched Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap. The simple gentle formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no dye or alcohol. And we told you last quarter about Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, which comes in 2 variants: avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and peony. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and peony variant has been the #1 Softsoap body wash variant at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks.
Let's turn to Europe. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners.
While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in individual countries, as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and GABA brands. And you may recall, we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen, which has met with great success. Our regional overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the nearest competitor.
In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period. Our year-to-date body wash share is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1%, with gains coming from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You'll recall we recently launched a range of Sanex products, including body wash for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets, France, Spain and the U.K., our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date.
Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3% to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over 1 point from 47.4% to 48.5%, with the most recent read at 50.1%, and this in the face of continued stiff competitive activity.
More innovation is planned for the back half of this year. And as in other parts of the world, the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optic with revitalized graphics and an improved formula which is 3x more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth.
A new GABA product is meridol's Parodont Expert, a clinically proven daily use toothpaste which increases gum resistance against periodontitis. This offering fills a gap in our portfolio.
And in Personal Care, we hope to continue the momentum in body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept which has been proven in other geographies. As I'm sure you'll recall, this range of body washes has a high density, creamy formula offered in Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch. New sleeve packaging provides a premium look, high-quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact.
Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market as it is the first range of products -- body washes, shampoo and underarm protection -- which is truly focused on men's health -- skin health.
Turning then to Latin America. The strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories. In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil, our share is at a record 73.3%, with the most recent read at 73.5%.
In the highly-competitive whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash has been supported by a new and strong marketing campaign, ""Designed to Make You Shine.""
In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date.
In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our share up 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the Personal Care category, in Brazil, we launched Protex Pro-Hidrata with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap, offering moisturizing sensation as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known.
The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as the leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil.
Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now are 2 new toothpastes. The first, priced at the premium range of the category, Colgate Total Professional Daily Repair, creates a shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel demineralization and prevents teeth and gum problems. The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro-polishing particles provides extra whitening. It removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness. Along with the Triple Action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action Whitening toothbrush.
To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex for Men 3 in 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers 3 benefits. Besides eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin, it prepares the skin for a soft shave and it can be used as a shampoo, leaving men's hair clean with a masculine fragrance.
Turning then to Asia/South Pacific. Results were somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strengths. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6%, with the most recent read at 64.6%. Lower priced offerings such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process of introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal toothpaste in that market.
In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovations slated for the balance of the year. In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients. And we told you last quarter about 2 toothpaste initiatives: Colgate Active Salt with Neem and Colgate Sensitive with Clove Essence. A third toothpaste launched in this quarter under the Cibaca sub-brand is Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti. The positioning is a toothpaste ""packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away."" In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal.
Mouthwash is a small but growing category across the region. Our regional share is up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum this quarter in India, we are launching Colgate Plax Spicy Fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn.
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market shares are strong.
In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses: Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8%. But in the most recent period, our share is at 28.1%. And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points, with the most recent read at 50.6%.
In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 39.2%. Now we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste, first launched in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON12 Complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria, while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, will be rolled out across this region, supported by media and key visuals in-store to communicate the benefits.
Similarly drawing from other regions, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivity from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, which adds ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste launched previously.
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels with improved graphics. And in addition, we've added 2 new variants, mint and coconut.
Turning to Hill's. As with the Colgate businesses, Hill's continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over a year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry and stews has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries. Building on the solid Metabolic Plus platform, in May of this year, we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Urinary Stress for cats, with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline lower urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems, which are very common in cats. The product is now available in 13 countries across North America and Europe.
Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth-largest therapeutic food category in dollar sales for pets. In 2016, we have 2 major initiatives in this area: Prescription Diet Derm Defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet z/d.
Prescription Diet Derm Defense is Hill's first and only nutrition with HistaGuard Complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's now in the U.S. and Europe and would be rolled out across the rest of the world. The science was presented both at a Global Derm Symposium in April in California and at the World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness among key thought leaders.
Our Prescription Diet z/d upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known to support skin and coat and GI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variant for the rapidly growing small dog population. Innovations across our Science Diet platform continue to do well.
In addition to our Science Diet Perfect Weight and Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North America. It's now the #1 wet variant for Science Diet.
In Europe, we have an online quiz and game as well as videos for the product to generate interest and trial.
So in summary then, we're very pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are delivering a healthy gross profit margin increase. Around the world, Colgate people are executing our focused strategies. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about what is yet to come. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we go through the balance of the year.
And now, Angela, I should like to turn it over to questions."

Asia, as you",588,"Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess, overall, I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2%, although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed. I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue, as I will describe, and then I can come back and talk about market shares, both overall and respective to China. So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace. 2 things. Number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up. And as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid-single digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is the shift of business from brick-and-mortar to online. Online showing very sharp growth. Indeed, our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part, because of backdoor selling from the brick-and-mortar retailers, which distorted pricing in the market and built inventory with wholesalers. Now we have seen that before, as you know, and we are seeing it again. And we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, but it will continue for a little while. In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world. And I would say on the world that our market share, in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down, but that is all to do with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share, on a constant currency basis, is up. And our market share in volume terms is up around the world. In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing 2 periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about the last time, which is premium innovation, to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace. So we don't think we're imbalanced from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, Yunnan Baiyao, has been flat in market share terms for the past 6 periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we see, it is this temporal adjustment again of slowdown in consumption, which has picked back up, but perhaps a more substantive shift over time -- move from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. Again, if the consumption is mid-single digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping; the consumption levels will not change. So something to work through, but we don't think substantive, and we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward."

Now the Mexican market share is still north of 80%, which is a fairly respectable place to be. And we quoted the Brazilian share at now approaching 74%. I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that the pricing -- that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impact of costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that, that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year. And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares. And as I said earlier, our market shares are not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume-driven than pricing-driven. And indeed, we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within the 4% to 7% range that we are staying with, it will be more volume-driven than pricing-driven for the entire year. So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing, which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time continue with the in-store work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we are very comfortable with our approach. And that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products in that part of the world."

The -- on Brazil, I think we take the view, as many others have announced, that we see this continuing for the balance of the year. We have not seen trading down in terms of our portfolio. Indeed, we did not see that. You will remember during the subprime period, and if consumers find themselves cash-stretched, they tend to buy a smaller size before they come back to the payday weekend. So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid-single-digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time, but these foreign exchange trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil. And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill in to one geography and one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly, again, even though this may continue to be contrarian, in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores and a good ROI. And we will continue to do that if that -- in a balanced way to build our brands."

So -- and the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil, for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the goods that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange moves. I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes, you're talking taking pricing, but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively-modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time. They have opportunities in terms of the different sizes we have, to buy at different price points and therefore mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do, do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps what might -- you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio. So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket. So that's the way I would answer it, Jon."

Doesn't matter whether it is a prescription product, a science product or even our Ideal Balance product. I think the thing you might want to read into it is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product, this the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet, to change the composition of the ingredients in those products to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value, thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition that they're looking for. And that was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a natural pure play. So Ideal Balance is doing okay, but I would say our major shift has been to make sure from a dietary composition point of view that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And of course, in making that change, have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the pet is provided is completely unchanged in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it. And all of the innovation that Bina talked about on the Prescription Diet side, as you've seen with the weight products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways given the different positionings of each of those 3 segments of the business."

It implies that your pricing -- your portfolio is down like almost 20% in aggregate since that time. And obviously, there's been a big continuous mix component, I'm assuming, as you roll in new premium innovation that's helped offset that in the volume line. But as I think about how that flows through to margins, I'm assuming that, that premiumization has been beneficial to margins. But if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, especially by segment, you typically call out funding the growth and then all-in kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefits or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing, that mix benefit?

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations.

Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer. 
On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5% within our targeted range of 4% to 7%, despite a continued difficult global macro environment.
Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point Latin America, where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison. 
Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015, led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1,071,000,000 and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year. And our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year. We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity-driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis.
Now we'll go through performance in the divisions. First, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories. And our innovation continues to perform well with the strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017.
A few North America highlights from the quarter. Our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes, are driving volume growth to premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis.
Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360° franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015.
In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush and in the Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush, which just launched in Q3, have added 1 full share point year-to-date. Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year, driven by new products, particularly rapid relief toothpaste.
In Personal Care, we continue to gain share in both liquid, hand soap and body wash, driven by new products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care. 
Now Latin America. The strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5%, despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3, following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela.
While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single-digit headwind from foreign exchange.
There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico.
In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership
[Audio Gap] 
share behind strengthen our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head towards 2017, not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories. 
Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region, share gains in the kids Oral Care segment behind the Minions regimen and share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano. Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment. In our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel's sweet pleasures, and on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date.
Moving to Europe. Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year, impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. 
Q3 highlights in the European division include: We continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date. Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. 
On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which include body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain. Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter. 
And now, Asia Pacific. Organic sales growth in Asia Pacific was 3%, driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding the growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment.
Some Q3 highlights in Asia Pacific include: In the Philippines, on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus a year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than 3 share points year-to-date. Other markets with a share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top line growth heading into 2017. 
Now Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the division remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing with volume down 2%. Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind.
Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. 
Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continued to trend positively. Q3 highlights in the Africa/Eurasia division include: Our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date, driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White. 
In South Africa, we continue to grow share year-over-year and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste with 2 Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa/Middle East and toothbrushes with Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care.
Moving on to Hill's. Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter, driven by pricing as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency.
Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vets and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. 
Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility and Metabolic Plus Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d. 
So to sum up in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to deliver notable gross margin improvement.
Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions."

That said, you're right. As we said on the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, structurally, there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model, which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of bets and then take those parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition, recommendation driven, scientifically proven with that innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So not a portfolio or a structural issue. I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely. But of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe. And that is clearly a growth that we are very much after driving Hill's into that online business. And we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online. So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So our view is that we will see progress, sequential progress, going forward, and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year. So I guess, that's the way I would frame the Hill's business, Dara."

The China situation is very much a continuation of what we described on the last call, which is again a slowdown in the traditional purchasing behavior of consumers and a sharp increase in online purchasing, which has led to a destocking process from an inventory point of view that is underway. Our online business doubled again in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved. And we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue.

The -- I think the first thing we would say about SG&A is we were very pleased with the increase in advertising that we saw across all of our operating divisions in this quarter funded, of course, by the progress we made on gross margin. We are right, we have a very sharp focus on the nonadvertising SG&A expense. And of course, that progress was to be delivered by our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and I would comment that, that program remains absolutely on track. Course you do suffer a little bit of deleverage in terms of the top line from a foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage. And I would also say that when we talked about the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring part of our reason for the tightening of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability. For example, staffing capability in some key markets. E-commerce capability in other markets and the traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies. But you're right, it is our intention through the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which has one more year to run to continue to control drive down, if we can, but certainly, be selective and choiceful about where we make the nonadvertising investments in SG&A."

And we are very comfortable with the plants we have in place of that -- we have in place period. In terms of our business, I guess, you -- it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had, specific to the Hill's business, and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter. Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world. And we have plans market by market that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line. So all I can really point to is the history of performance, the current performance in the quarter and the clarity of strategy and focus on delivery against that strategy, and then the execution of that, that I think we have demonstrated for a while, notwithstanding comments over the years about penetration can't go up per capita, consumptions can't go up, markets must slow, a whole plethora of so-called risks against the business, which I think across the company, we have successfully navigated and believe we can continue to do so going forward."

The -- and I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps the reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably and so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit of growth in local currency still are on that mid-single-digit area largely driven by pricing. As we have said before, about Brazil, our focus is on making sure, whatever the category size is, we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those 2 new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done. And I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while. And if you take the gross profit growth forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit. Pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding the growth savings was 2.2 points favorable. and the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative. And a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4 and the 160 basis points increase. Now when we provided our results for the second quarter, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points. And at that time, we said that we expected or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points or so the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter, we would expect a sequential, as it has been for the last 3 quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter, sequential from the third to the fourth to close out of the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit."

Is it -- is the savings winding down? And then on inflation. Inflation setup as a percentage of COGS, I think running around 4.4, which is about the some 3 rate for the first half. It's a bit surprising given FX we would have thought the transaction drag to be abating. But they do note that it's kind of typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, one is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication historical pattern?

I think you're right to say that as far as foreign exchange lessons, the transaction impact lessons. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost. Now as we get into our budgeting process without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going in position to be validated as we go through the process is no immediate underlying commodity issues. And you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half. On the Funding the Growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our Funding the Growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the products we have some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years. So I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward."

As we worked our way into the year, we found foreign exchange continue to dedevil and we were, of necessity, forced to take pricing to protect our margin and rebuild the margin, which would, after 3 years of that gross profit being flat, to rebuild of that gross profit so that we could invest in the business. And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lessen as foreign exchange lessens. But then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selected markets. All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting. We believe we still have the capacity to take pricing to protect the gross profit and that the consumer continues to stay with the brand through those pricing actions.

Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer. 
On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5% within our targeted range of 4% to 7%, despite a continued difficult global macro environment.
Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point Latin America, where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison. 
Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015, led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1,071,000,000 and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year. And our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year. We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity-driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis.
Now we'll go through performance in the divisions. First, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories. And our innovation continues to perform well with the strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017.
A few North America highlights from the quarter. Our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes, are driving volume growth to premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis.
Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360° franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015.
In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush and in the Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush, which just launched in Q3, have added 1 full share point year-to-date. Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year, driven by new products, particularly rapid relief toothpaste.
In Personal Care, we continue to gain share in both liquid, hand soap and body wash, driven by new products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care. 
Now Latin America. The strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5%, despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3, following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela.
While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single-digit headwind from foreign exchange.
There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico.
In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership
[Audio Gap] 
share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head towards 2017, not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories. 
Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region, share gains in the kids Oral Care segment behind the Minions regimen and share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano. Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment. In our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel's sweet pleasures, and on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date.
Moving to Europe. Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year, impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. 
Q3 highlights in the European division include: We continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date. Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. 
On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which include body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain. Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter. 
And now, Asia Pacific. Organic sales growth in Asia Pacific was 3%, driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding the growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment.
Some Q3 highlights in Asia Pacific include: In the Philippines, on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus a year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than 3 share points year-to-date. Other markets with a share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top line growth heading into 2017. 
Now Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the division remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing with volume down 2%. Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind.
Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. 
Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continued to trend positively. Q3 highlights in the Africa/Eurasia division include: Our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date, driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White. 
In South Africa, we continue to grow share year-over-year and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste with 2 Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa/Middle East and toothbrushes with Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care.
Moving on to Hill's. Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter, driven by pricing as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency.
Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vets and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. 
Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility and Metabolic Plus Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d. 
So to sum up in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to deliver notable gross margin improvement.
Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions."

That said, you're right. As we said on the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, that structurally, there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model, which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of pets and then take those pet parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition, recommendation-driven, scientifically proven with an innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So not a portfolio or a structural issue. I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely. But of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe. And that is clearly a growth that we are very much after, driving Hill's into that online business. And we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online. So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So our view is that we will see progress, sequential progress, going forward, and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year.

So our e-commerce strategy is to reach the consumers where they are learning about the brand and where we can educate them about the brand, which is a large part of the Hill's model. And that capability exists on all of the e-sites that are out there. And therefore, our e-strategy is broad in that regard.

The China situation is very much a continuation of what we described on the last call, which is again a slowdown in the traditional purchasing behavior of consumers and a sharp increase in online purchasing, which has led to a destocking process from an inventory point of view that is underway. Our online business doubled again in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved. And we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue. So China is a particular circumstance that we described in terms of broad-based consumer behavior in the emerging markets.

And this is very much part of our innovation programming that we see going forward. In Russia, we took some very swift action in the early days of the severe currency devaluation both structurally, both pricing, in order that we could rebuild our margins and continue to drive the growth of that business where the market share continues to grow in Russia and quite nicely, I would add.

And of course, that progress was to be delivered by our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and I would comment that, that program remains absolutely on track. Of course you do suffer a little bit of deleverage in terms of the top line from a foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage. And I will also say that when we talked about the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring part of our reason for the tightening of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability. For example, staffing capability in some key markets. E-commerce capability in other markets and the traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies. But you're right, it is our intention through the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which has one more year to run to continue to control drive down, if we can, but certainly, be selective and choiceful about where we make the nonadvertising investments in SG&A."

In terms of our business, I guess, you -- it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had, specific to the Hill's business, and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter. Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world. And we have plans market by market that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line.

The -- and I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps the reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit a growth in local currency still around that mid-single-digit area largely driven by pricing. As we have said before about Brazil, our focus is on making sure, whatever the category size is, we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those 2 new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done. And I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while. And if you take the gross profit growth forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit. Pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding the growth savings was 2.2 points favorable. And the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative. And a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4 and the 160 basis points increase. Now when we provided our results for the second quarter, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points. And at that time, we said that we expected or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points, so the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter, we would expect a sequential, as it has been for the last 3 quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter, sequential from the third to the fourth to close out the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit."

It's a bit surprising given FX, we would have thought the transaction drag to be abating. But I do note that it's kind of typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is lower in the front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, why is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication of historical pattern? Or should we underwrite the acceleration of inflation as something you're going to have to contest with on the forward. Sorry, lots there."

I think you're right to say that as foreign exchange lessens, the transaction impact lessens. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost. Now as we get into our budgeting process and without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going-in position to be validated as we go through the process is no immediate underlying commodity issues. And you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half. On the funding the growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our funding-the-growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the projects we have, some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years. So I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward."

And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lessen as foreign exchange lessens. But then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selected markets. All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting. We believe we still have the capacity to take pricing to protect the gross profit and that the consumer continues to stay with the brand through those pricing actions.

On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5% within our targeted range of 4% to 7%, despite a continued difficult global macro environment.
Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point Latin America, where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison. 
Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015, led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1,071,000,000 and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year, and our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year. 
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity-driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis.
Now we'll go through performance in the divisions. First, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories. And our innovation continues to perform well with the strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017.
A few North America highlights from the quarter. Our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes, are driving volume growth to premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis.
Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. 
Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360° franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015.
In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush and in the Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush which just launched in Q3, have added 1 full share point year-to-date. 
Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year, driven by new products, particularly rapid relief toothpaste.
In Personal Care, we continue to gain share in both liquid, hand soap and body wash, driven by new products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care. 
Now Latin America. The strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5%, despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3, following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela.
While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single-digit headwind from foreign exchange.
There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico.
In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership
[Audio Gap] 
share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head towards 2017, not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories. 
Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region, share gains in the kids Oral Care segment behind the Minions regimen and share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano. Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment. In our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel's sweet pleasures, and on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date.
Moving to Europe. Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year, impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. 
Q3 highlights in the European division include: We continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date. Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. 
On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which include body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain. Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter. 
And now Asia Pacific. Organic sales growth in Asia Pacific was 3%, driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding the growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment.
Some Q3 highlights in Asia Pacific include: In the Philippines, on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than 3 share points year-to-date. Other markets with a share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top line growth heading into 2017. 
Now Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the division remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing with volume down 2%. Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind.
Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. 
Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continued to trend positively. Q3 highlights in the Africa/Eurasia division include: Our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date, driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White. 
In South Africa, we continue to grow share year-over-year, and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste with 2 Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa/Middle East and toothbrushes with Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care.
Moving on to Hill's. Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter, driven by pricing as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency.
Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vets and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. 
Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility and Metabolic Plus Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d. 
So to sum up in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to deliver notable gross margin improvement.
Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions."

That said, you're right. As we said in the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, that structurally, there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model, which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of pets and then take those pet parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition, recommendation driven, scientifically proven with an innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So not a portfolio or a structural issue. I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely. But of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe. And that is clearly a growth that we are very much after, driving Hill's into that online business. And we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online. So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So our view is that we will see progress, sequential progress, going forward, and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year. So I guess that's the way I would frame the Hill's business, Dara."

So our e-commerce strategy is to reach the consumers where they are learning about the brand and where we can educate them about the brand, which is a large part of the Hill's model.

The China situation is very much a continuation of what we described on the last call, which is again a slowdown in the traditional purchasing behavior of consumers and a sharp increase in online purchasing, which has led to a destocking process from an inventory point of view that is underway. Our online business doubled again in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved. And we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue.

Think about Tom's in the U.S. But to engage more broadly and deeply in what you might call generally the naturals space, and this is very much part of our innovation programming that we see going forward. In Russia, we took some very swift action in the early days of the severe currency devaluation both structurally, both pricing, in order that we could rebuild our margins and continue to drive the growth of that business where the market share continues to grow in Russia and quite nicely, I would add.

And of course, that progress was to be delivered by our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and I would comment that, that program remains absolutely on track. Of course you do suffer a little bit of deleverage in terms of the top line from a foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage. And I will also say that when we talked about the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring part of our reason for the titling of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability. For example, staffing capability in some key markets. E-commerce capability in other markets and the traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies. But you're right, it is our intention through the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which has one more year to run to continue to control drive down, if we can, but certainly, be selective and choiceful about where we make the nonadvertising investments in SG&A."

So at least versus consensus, you missed, it looks like organic sales growth for all regions, but 2. You had some kind of disappointments with South Africa, clearly, Hill's, which you've talked about. Clearly, relying a lot more inflationary pricing in Latin America and now a little bit more in Asia Pacific.

And we're very comfortable with the plans we have in place of that -- we have in place. In terms of our business, I guess, you -- it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had, specific to the Hill's business, and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter. Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world. And we have plans market by market that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line. So all I can really point to is the history of performance, the current performance in the quarter and the clarity of strategy and focus on delivery against that strategy, and then the execution of that, that I think we have demonstrated for a while, notwithstanding comments over the years about penetration can't go up, per capita consumption can't go up, markets must slow, a whole plethora of so-called risks against the business, which I think across the company, we have successfully navigated and believe we can continue to do so going forward."

If they prefer to shop online, we're just as happy to have them shop online with the e-commerce site of a traditional retail partner as a stand-alone retail outlet, e-commerce outlet. So we go where the consumer is. And as we think about that, we have globally a central capability, which I would say is strategy and capabilities oriented that defines our global strategy, the tools and techniques and approach that we will deploy around the world, but then very much in the operating divisions. And specifically on the ground, we have e-commerce teams and we manage the finances of our e-commerce business on a stand-alone basis. So we understand the investments and the return we are getting from that business. So as you might imagine, for us, it's planful and thoughtful and of course it is wrapped around by our overall digital strategy. And I would comment, you may remember the executive, Maria Elisa Carvajal, who presented at CAGNY last year about digital. She today is running our Global Advertising Group. So taking that skill set and wrapping it around everything that we are doing digitally. But thoughtful for the long haul in service of the consumer with the right global capabilities and then a very clear on the ground focus."

The -- and I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps the reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit a growth in local currency still around that mid-single-digit area largely driven by pricing. As we have said before about Brazil, our focus is on making sure, whatever the category size is, we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those 2 new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done. And I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while. And if you take the gross profit growth forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit. Pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding the growth savings were 2.2 points favorable. And the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative. And a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4 and the 160 basis points increase. Now when we provided our results for the second quarter, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points. And at that time, we said that we expected or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points. So the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter, we would expect a sequential, as it has been for the last 3 quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter, sequential from the third to the fourth to close out the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit."

When you do the calculations on the numbers you just laid out, it implies that year-to-date productivity, as -- and COGS dollars, is running around $211 million, which is about $50 million shy of your year-to-date run rate in the last couple of years. So question one on gross margins is, with fading productivity, is this just timing related? Should we expect it to tick up? Or would you in sort of rounding out your 2 of the most recent productivity program, is it just -- is the savings winding down? And then on inflation. Inflation stepped up as a percentage of COGS, I think running around 4.4, which is above the sub-3 rate for the first half. It's a bit surprising given FX, we would have thought the transaction drag to be abating. But I do note that it's kind of typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is lower in the front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, why is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication of historical pattern? Or should we underwrite the acceleration of inflation as something you're going to have to contest with on the forward.

I think you're right to say that as foreign exchange lessens, the transaction impact lessens. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost. Now as we get into our budgeting process and without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going-in position to be validated as we go through the process is no immediate underlying commodity issues. And you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half. On the funding the growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our funding-the-growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the projects we have, some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years. So I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward."

And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lessen as foreign exchange lessens. But then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selected markets. All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting. We believe we still have the capacity to take pricing to protect the gross profit and that the consumer continues to stay with the brand through those pricing actions.

On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5% within our targeted range of 4% to 7%, despite a continued difficult global macro environment.
Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point Latin America, where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison. 
Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015, led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1,071,000,000 and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year, and our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year. 
We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity-driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis.
Now we'll go through performance in the divisions. First, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories. And our innovation continues to perform well with the strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017.
A few North America highlights from the quarter. Our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes, are driving volume growth to premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis.
Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. 
Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360° franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015.
In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360° Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush and in the Colgate 360° Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush which just launched in Q3, have added 1 full share point year-to-date. 
Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year, driven by new products, particularly rapid relief toothpaste.
In Personal Care, we continue to gain share in both liquid, hand soap and body wash, driven by new products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care. 
Now Latin America. The strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5%, despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3, following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela.
While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single-digit headwind from foreign exchange.
There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico.
In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership
[Audio Gap] 
share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head towards 2017, not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories. 
Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region, share gains in the kids Oral Care segment behind the Minions regimen and share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano. Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment. In our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel's sweet pleasures, and on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date.
Moving to Europe. Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year, impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. 
Q3 highlights in the European division include: We continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date. Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. 
On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which include body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain. Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter. 
And now Asia Pacific. Organic sales growth in Asia Pacific was 3%, driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding the growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment.
Some Q3 highlights in Asia Pacific include: In the Philippines, on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than 3 share points year-to-date. Other markets with a share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top line growth heading into 2017. 
Now Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the division remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing with volume down 2%. Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind.
Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. 
Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continued to trend positively. Q3 highlights in the Africa/Eurasia division include: Our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date, driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White. 
In South Africa, we continue to grow share year-over-year, and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste with 2 Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa/Middle East and toothbrushes with Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care.
Moving on to Hill's. Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter, driven by pricing as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency.
Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vets and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. 
Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility and Metabolic Plus Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d. 
So to sum up in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to deliver notable gross margin improvement.
Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions."

That said, you're right. As we said in the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, that structurally, there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model, which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of pets and then take those pet parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition, recommendation driven, scientifically proven with an innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So not a portfolio or a structural issue. I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely. But of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe. And that is clearly a growth that we are very much after, driving Hill's into that online business. And we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online. So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So our view is that we will see progress, sequential progress, going forward, and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year. So I guess that's the way I would frame the Hill's business, Dara."

So our e-commerce strategy is to reach the consumers where they are learning about the brand and where we can educate them about the brand, which is a large part of the Hill's model.

Our online business doubled again in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved. And we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue.

Of course you do suffer a little bit of deleverage in terms of the top line from a foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage. And I will also say that when we talked about the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring part of our reason for the titling of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability. For example, staffing capability in some key markets. E-commerce capability in other markets and the traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies.

And so are you at risk at feeling or are you perhaps even already feeling the same impact from being underrepresented in e-commerce for any other pieces of your business, given some of the volume challenges we've seen, so especially U.S., China, arguably, Western Europe. That's one question. The other one is, I guess more broadly and perhaps more importantly. Just a question of kind of sustainability, right? So I'm not talking about environmental sustainability, just sustainability of your numbers. It just felt like this past quarter was a little bit tougher. So at least versus consensus, you missed, it looks like organic sales growth for all regions, but 2. You had some kind of disappointments with South Africa, clearly, Hill's, which you've talked about. Clearly, relying a lot more inflationary pricing in Latin America and now a little bit more in Asia Pacific. And then the shares at least from omission look like U.K. might be share loss or flat, China similar, India similar, Mexico similar. So I just want your reaction to that, and I know you're going to be benign on that reaction. But really, as investors and analysts, what shouldn't give us pause about those types of facts looking forward?"

The answer to your first question is no. We're not concerned about being underrepresented. We hear a lot of our competitors talk about e-commerce, how it is a significant trend and how the full potential of it hasn't been tapped. We are seeing our market share grow. And we're very comfortable with the plans we have in place of that -- we have in place. In terms of our business, I guess, you -- it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had, specific to the Hill's business, and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter. Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world. And we have plans market by market that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line. So all I can really point to is the history of performance, the current performance in the quarter and the clarity of strategy and focus on delivery against that strategy, and then the execution of that, that I think we have demonstrated for a while, notwithstanding comments over the years about penetration can't go up, per capita consumption can't go up, markets must slow, a whole plethora of so-called risks against the business, which I think across the company, we have successfully navigated and believe we can continue to do so going forward."

And specifically on the ground, we have e-commerce teams and we manage the finances of our e-commerce business on a stand-alone basis.

The -- and I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps the reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit a growth in local currency still around that mid-single-digit area largely driven by pricing. As we have said before about Brazil, our focus is on making sure, whatever the category size is, we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those 2 new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done. And I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while. And if you take the gross profit growth forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit. Pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding the growth savings were 2.2 points favorable. And the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative. And a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4 and the 160 basis points increase. Now when we provided our results for the second quarter, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points. And at that time, we said that we expected or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points. So the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter, we would expect a sequential, as it has been for the last 3 quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter, sequential from the third to the fourth to close out the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit."

When you do the calculations on the numbers you just laid out, it implies that year-to-date productivity, as -- and COGS dollars, is running around $211 million, which is about $50 million shy of your year-to-date run rate in the last couple of years. So question one on gross margins is, with fading productivity, is this just timing related? Should we expect it to tick up? Or would you in sort of rounding out your 2 of the most recent productivity program, is it just -- is the savings winding down? And then on inflation. Inflation stepped up as a percentage of COGS, I think running around 4.4, which is above the sub-3 rate for the first half. It's a bit surprising given FX, we would have thought the transaction drag to be abating. But I do note that it's kind of typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is lower in the front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, why is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication of historical pattern? Or should we underwrite the acceleration of inflation as something you're going to have to contest with on the forward.

I think you're right to say that as foreign exchange lessens, the transaction impact lessens. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost. Now as we get into our budgeting process and without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going-in position to be validated as we go through the process is no immediate underlying commodity issues. And you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half. On the funding the growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our funding-the-growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the projects we have, some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years. So I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward."

And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lessen as foreign exchange lessens. But then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selected markets. All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter.
As you will hear in more detail as I go through the divisions, our market shares around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, and our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong, and working capital is under very good control.
And as you read in this morning's press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015, to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements as we stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations will be about negative $0.10 for the full year, and we'd expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.
So let's turn to the divisions. First, with North America. We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you'd expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results. 
In the third quarter 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. 
In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are 2x more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015.
Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last read of 2015 thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. 
And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we're launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White, which provides 4 shades visibly whiter teeth in 6 weeks and starts working in just 3 days. Also, we're introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel. 
To bolster our toothbrush business, we're launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking powered toothbrush featuring kids' favorite licensed characters, which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a 2-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing.
Also in the first quarter, Tom's of Maine is launching Tom's Natural Rapid Relief Sensitive Toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid relief and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium priced. 
Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date, and our year-to-date body wash increased 80 basis points. More innovation this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we're launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes hand washing fun as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye free, alcohol free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies. And in body wash, we're launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony -- designed to leave skin feeling soft. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioners. In the toothpaste category, we've seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date.
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market shares are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the U.K., which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up 1 full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full.
In the toothpaste category, we're introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high-cleaning prophy silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we're restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.
In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate 360 Degree Expert White Toothbrush plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. 
And in Personal Care, we're relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high-quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch will enchant consumers at point of sale.
Also in Personal Care is the Palmolive Skin Garden line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances; natural ingredients rooted in the garden, such as violet and honey, peony, pear and mirabelle plum; sensorial and vivid textures; and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive equity. 
And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well, and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced Shower Oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced Body Balms in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. 
Sanex Men will also be launched, which is the first mass personal care range truly focused on men's skin health. 
As you know, we have a very strong market-leading home care business in this region, and an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays, which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces: the oven and microwave, vitroceramic and stainless steel.
So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, shampoos and liquid cleaners. 
In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb, up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most recent read at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success.
In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar, increased 70 basis points and is now almost to 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the superpremium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360.
In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the #1 and #2 positions in the region, and we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. 
In oral care whitening category, we have 3 exciting launches. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers 3 shades whiter teeth. A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol-free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in 2 days will both be launched later this year. 
In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefit, ""see the removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth"" and should drive growth for the category.
In personal care, under the Protex name, we're launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soap: Protex Pro-Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin, it's necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing. This innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive Almond and Omega Oil with a nourishing formula. 
In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skincare. 
Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses, Greater China and India, and this despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth.
 
In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and the relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal, with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces, has added market share.
Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis, but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. 
A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01-millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points, respectively, in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Whitening Pen, and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read.
Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year with the most recent read at 26.5%. 
And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are 5 variants, Tea Tree Oil Gum Care, Lemon Zesty Radiating White, Jasmine Chamomile Healthy Refreshing, Lotus Jade Green Soothing Gum and Seaweed Salt Pure White. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients. 
And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category: Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black with a flexible neck and improved handle and a line of mid-tier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. 
To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we're launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection.
Then going to Africa/Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. 
Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up 1 full point from the year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.
In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution played an important role in these results. In Israel, 2 new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2% with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%.
Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points. 
And we have some exciting innovation for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste across the division. This -- the differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breath-freshening technology: ON12 Complex.
Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng. 
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding 2 new variants: Feel Good and So Dynamic.
Finally, with Hill's. Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All 3 bands -- Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance -- are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic pet foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and Petco, which contributed to our solid results. 
In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We're seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. 
And we're very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's available in dry and delicious stew forms and, of course, will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population.
Hill's will also be entering the wearable space. Hill's has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary health care with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it's designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis or obesity. 
New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill's Science Diet Healthy Cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new alginate technology to deliver superior-looking tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.
So before I wrap up, quickly, I want to cover 2 more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million per quarter with the loss of the interest income from Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were $896.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter 2015 due to the onetime charge for Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercise of in-the-money stock options as they're anti-dilutive. We'd expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we're extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world. Our gross margin increased, and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby, delivering these consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, as is our ongoing Funding the Growth program. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
So Chanel, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn that over now to Q&A."

But the volume reaction looked more severe than what we've seen traditionally in your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macro environment if you're seeing any different behavior versus the past with the macro slowdown we're seeing in Latin America and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure. And then that's at the consumer level, but at the competitor level, what are you generally seeing from your competitors? Are they following?

262247,322238631,2485283,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in",619,"Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year, and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in 2 years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers; then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the longer term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we want for the future; and then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that's required to deal with events as they unfold. Now if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there, as it was in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brands. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took a conscious decision to take pricing, to help recover gross margin and suffer the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares, whether you look at the value market share in local currency as being a talk to -- specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they're up. So the consumer is staying with us, and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that we have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say, and it relates to the gross margin: First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it'll be at a lesser level; second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down; third, we have our funding-the-growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we had less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing, and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down-trading, and we're confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business."

But then, broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you're seeing there, it surprises me that we're seeing a slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get it in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically, China and India, I think you called out? Do you think there's something more structural there? Do you think there's -- going to take a longer time? Do you really think it's an economic factor that's leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you can talk about that, that'd be great."

We haven't seen anything dramatic in terms of a change in behavior thus far. We're obviously very focused on that, Wendy, as you would suppose we would be. And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India, as Bina mentioned with India, are both up nicely in 2015. So we stay close to it. Right now, we continue to see categories growing around mid-single digits in local currency terms."

It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you're taking pricing in. On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased the product, to engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital but also the so-called traditional media and then, of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level, where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected, as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where he -- we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising -- the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and, of course, on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation."

Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points positive, 2.9%. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, a modest negative with all other, and you get to the 59%. Now as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less-aggressive foreign exchange headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less but half of it rollover. We have funding the growth, which you know very well. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016."

And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create a trial and repeat of our brands, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the schoolroom to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including television, including magazine advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of the brand than you were putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance. We think we've kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix, and we will monitor very, very closely the trial-and-repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world because we're a marketing company, and that's what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74% share in Brazil. That's how much of the shelf you have. You can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of overproliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one-in, one-out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now within that, you have cycles when you're replacing and you've got a double count, but it's something we watch really at the top of the house. And it's a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything: the factory, the inventory. You can imagine all of the touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we're at risk of overproliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year-upon-year."

As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity costs with oil at -- even at $35 are basically flat to modestly down. That's a favorable.

The first is a lot more discussion about the local brands and things like that, yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what you've seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint? And then the second question, Ian, is probably it's a little bit of a devil's advocate question and probably not one you're expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you've had over the last 6 to 12 months, wouldn't that argue that, longer term, that the gross margin expansion, which we've been looking for, is less relevant, right. It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the gross margin. So I guess, sort of putting it back into your court in that regard, doesn't the gross margin lose some of its importance over time if you're moving these buckets around more?"

I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies.

I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say, I can't give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they've stayed there, or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is, against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points we have in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of mums today in Latin America are millennials, that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that's a great place to go to touch those kinds of consumers. And I think, personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lauren's point about premium innovation. And it's off that fulcrum everything else comes. Because otherwise, from an operating point of view, you're only leaving yourself really leverage, overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses. Okay. Well, I'm pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter.
As you will hear in more detail as I go through the divisions, our market shares around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, and our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong, and working capital is under very good control.
And as you read in this morning's press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015, to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements as we stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations will be about negative $0.10 for the full year, and we'd expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.
So let's turn to the divisions. First, with North America. We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you'd expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results. 
In the third quarter 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. 
In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are 2x more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015.
Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last read of 2015 thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. 
And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we're launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White, which provides 4 shades visibly whiter teeth in 6 weeks and starts working in just 3 days. Also, we're introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel. 
To bolster our toothbrush business, we're launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking powered toothbrush featuring kids' favorite licensed characters, which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a 2-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing.
Also in the first quarter, Tom's of Maine is launching Tom's Natural Rapid Relief Sensitive Toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid relief and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium priced. 
Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date, and our year-to-date body wash increased 80 basis points. More innovation this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we're launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes hand washing fun as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye free, alcohol free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies. And in body wash, we're launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony -- designed to leave skin feeling soft. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioners. In the toothpaste category, we've seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date.
Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market shares are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the U.K., which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up 1 full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full.
In the toothpaste category, we're introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high-cleaning prophy silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we're restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.
In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate 360 Degree Expert White Toothbrush plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. 
And in Personal Care, we're relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high-quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch will enchant consumers at point of sale.
Also in Personal Care is the Palmolive Skin Garden line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances; natural ingredients rooted in the garden, such as violet and honey, peony, pear and mirabelle plum; sensorial and vivid textures; and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive equity. 
And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well, and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced Shower Oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced Body Balms in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. 
Sanex Men will also be launched, which is the first mass personal care range truly focused on men's skin health. 
As you know, we have a very strong market-leading home care business in this region, and an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays, which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces: the oven and microwave, vitroceramic and stainless steel.
So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, shampoos and liquid cleaners. 
In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb, up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most recent read at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success.
In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar, increased 70 basis points and is now almost to 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the superpremium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360.
In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the #1 and #2 positions in the region, and we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. 
In oral care whitening category, we have 3 exciting launches. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers 3 shades whiter teeth. A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol-free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in 2 days will both be launched later this year. 
In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefit, ""see the removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth"" and should drive growth for the category.
In personal care, under the Protex name, we're launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soap: Protex Pro-Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin, it's necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing. This innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive Almond and Omega Oil with a nourishing formula. 
In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skincare. 
Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses, Greater China and India, and this despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth.
 
In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and the relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal, with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces, has added market share.
Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis, but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. 
A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01-millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points, respectively, in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Whitening Pen, and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read.
Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year with the most recent read at 26.5%. 
And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are 5 variants, Tea Tree Oil Gum Care, Lemon Zesty Radiating White, Jasmine Chamomile Healthy Refreshing, Lotus Jade Green Soothing Gum and Seaweed Salt Pure White. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients. 
And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category: Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black with a flexible neck and improved handle and a line of mid-tier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. 
To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we're launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection.
Then going to Africa/Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. 
Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up 1 full point from the year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.
In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution played an important role in these results. In Israel, 2 new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2% with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%.
Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points. 
And we have some exciting innovation for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste across the division. This -- the differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breath-freshening technology: ON12 Complex.
Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng. 
In the Personal Care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding 2 new variants: Feel Good and So Dynamic.
Finally, with Hill's. Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All 3 bands -- Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance -- are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic pet foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and Petco, which contributed to our solid results. 
In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We're seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. 
And we're very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It's available in dry and delicious stew forms and, of course, will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population.
Hill's will also be entering the wearable space. Hill's has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary health care with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it's designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis or obesity. 
New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill's Science Diet Healthy Cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new alginate technology to deliver superior-looking tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.
So before I wrap up, quickly, I want to cover 2 more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million per quarter with the loss of the interest income from Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were $896.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter 2015 due to the onetime charge for Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercise of in-the-money stock options as they're anti-dilutive. We'd expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we're extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world. Our gross margin increased, and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby, delivering these consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, as is our ongoing Funding the Growth program. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
So Chanel, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn that over now to Q&A."

But the volume reaction looked more severe than what we've seen traditionally in your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macro environment if you're seeing any different behavior versus the past with the macro slowdown we're seeing in Latin America and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure.

262247,322238631,2485285,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in",619,"Yes. Thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year, and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in 2 years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers; then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the longer term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we want for the future; and then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that's required to deal with events as they unfold. Now if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there, as it was in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brands. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took a conscious decision to take pricing, to help recover gross margin and suffer the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares, whether you look at the value market share in local currency as being a talk to -- specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they're up. So the consumer is staying with us, and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that we have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say, and it relates to the gross margin: First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it'll be at a lesser level; second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down; third, we have our funding-the-growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we had less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing, and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down-trading, and we're confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business."

I know the comps in Latin America on the volume side are really tough in the first half of '16. So do you think we're going to see negative volume growth maybe for the next quarter or 2, potentially even worse than we just saw in the fourth quarter in Latin America? But then, broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you're seeing there, it surprises me that we're seeing a slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get it in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically, China and India, I think you called out? Do you think there's something more structural there? Do you think there's -- going to take a longer time? Do you really think it's an economic factor that's leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you can talk about that, that'd be great."

But no, we don't expect a repeat of that level. When you turn to Asia and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in categories is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen anything dramatic in terms of a change in behavior thus far. We're obviously very focused on that, Wendy, as you would suppose we would be. And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India, as Bina mentioned with India, are both up nicely in 2015. So we stay close to it. Right now, we continue to see categories growing around mid-single digits in local currency terms."

It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you're taking pricing in. On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased the product, to engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital but also the so-called traditional media and then, of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level, where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected, as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where he -- we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising -- the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and, of course, on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation."

And perhaps I should take the opportunity now before Lauren comes on and chides me of going through the roll-forward for that fourth quarter gross profit. So if you go to the gross profit in the prior year, it was 58.8%. Pricing, our strongest showing for the year, up 1.6 percentage points, so positive 1.6 points. Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points positive, 2.9%. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, a modest negative with all other, and you get to the 59%. Now as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less-aggressive foreign exchange headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less but half of it rollover. We have funding the growth, which you know very well. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016."

And then on nonadvertising -- ex advertising SG&A, I thought we would see more benefit because of the hubbing and the restructuring and everything that we talked about there. Why are we not seeing more there? So that's the SG&A question. And then on the SKU proliferation or innovation question, do you -- how do you guys -- so every quarter, we hear really interesting things. Bina is basically out of breath describing them at the start of every quarter. How do you guys deal with SKU proliferation? Is there a very clear discipline of put one in, take one out?

And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create a trial and repeat of our brands, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the schoolroom to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including television, including magazine advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of the brand than you were putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance. We think we've kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix, and we will monitor very, very closely the trial-and-repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world because we're a marketing company, and that's what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74% share in Brazil. That's how much of the shelf you have. You can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of overproliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one-in, one-out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now within that, you have cycles when you're replacing and you've got a double count, but it's something we watch really at the top of the house. And it's a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything: the factory, the inventory. You can imagine all of the touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we're at risk of overproliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year-upon-year."

Now of course, that improvement builds over the year. But still, overall, it is less negative. As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity costs with oil at -- even at $35 are basically flat to modestly down. That's a favorable.

The first is a lot more discussion about the local brands and things like that, yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what you've seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint? And then the second question, Ian, is probably it's a little bit of a devil's advocate question and probably not one you're expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you've had over the last 6 to 12 months, wouldn't that argue that, longer term, that the gross margin expansion, which we've been looking for, is less relevant, right. It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the gross margin. So I guess, sort of putting it back into your court in that regard, doesn't the gross margin lose some of its importance over time if you're moving these buckets around more?"

I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say, I can't give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they've stayed there, or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is, against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points we have in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of mums today in Latin America are millennials, that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that's a great place to go to touch those kinds of consumers. And I think, personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lauren's point about premium innovation. And it's off that fulcrum everything else comes. Because otherwise, from an operating point of view, you're only leaving yourself really leverage, overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses. Okay. Well, I'm pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions, and we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much."
