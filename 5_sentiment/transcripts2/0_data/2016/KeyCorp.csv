Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; E.J. Burke; and Dennis Devine, co- presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question and answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter closes out what has been a very significant year for our company. We improved our operating performance, continued our credit discipline, maintained our strong capital position and made investments that will drive future growth and profitability. For the year, Key generated positive operating leverage that we believe was among the strongest in our peer group. Our revenues were up 3% and our pre-provision net revenue was up 5%, both compared to the prior year. These results reflect our success in continuing to grow and expand client relationships in both the Community Bank and the Corporate Bank, and these new clients contributed to our 5% growth in average loans and 12% growth in CF&A balances. We also increased our core fee-based income including investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up 12%, another record year for us. Corporate services and cards and payments were both up over 10%. And I think it's worth noting that these are areas where we have made recent investments that are generating growth and positive returns. 
Expense management also remained an area of focus. During the year, we continue to execute on opportunities to rightsize our business, reduce occupancy costs and improve operational efficiency. Expense trends reflect our investments to drive future growth and profitability as well as merger-related charges and those related to our continuous improvement and efficiency effort. Investments during the year included remixing our headcount to increase client facing roles in both the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank. We also enhanced our payments capability, which have driven strong growth in purchase and prepaid card as well as a 13% increase year-over-year in credit card sales. And we continue to invest in our digital and mobile offerings as well as ongoing enhancements to our compliance and regulatory processes. These were good investments that help drive our revenue growth in 2015 and they will make an even larger contribution in the future as they fully mature. While these investments, including the addition of 60 senior bankers in our Corporate and Community Bank, as well as Pacific Crest Securities, position us for growth, they offset some of the efficiency improvements made in other areas of our company last year. Importantly, we remain committed to further improvement in the targets that we have established. 
Credit quality remained a good story in 2015 but nonperforming loans down for the year and net charge-offs of 24 basis points which is below our targeted range. We remain committed to strong risk management practices and staying true to our relationship focus. The final item on the slide is capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 11% which we believe positions us well for the 2016 CCAR process and we expect both share repurchases and a dividend increase to be part of the capital plan we will submit. 
I'm now moving to Slide 4 which provides some highlights of our announced acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to make good progress as we move toward our anticipated closing in the third quarter of this year. Under the leadership of Chris Gorman, we have established integration teams with some of the top talent from both Key and First Niagara and these teams have been focused on developing detailed assessments and moving forward with our integration plan. As we move through these early stages, I'm even more confident in this be the right opportunity for Key and our ability to realize the cost-savings. The combined company will generate attractive financial returns and create value for our shareholders and accelerates our progress towards becoming a high-performing regional bank. And although not included in our financial projections, we will realize additional value from revenue synergies that will also add to the financial performance. We look forward to sharing more developments with you in the coming quarter as we move towards closing. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to close my remarks by saying that it was a good year for Key. We executed against our strategic and financial goals and took steps to accelerate our progress going forward. I'm proud of our team and of our performance and I'm excited about the opportunity that we have ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results. Don?"

That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, K",1465,"Thanks, and I'm on Slide 6. That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Key incurred $10 million of charges related to pension settlement and the acquisition of First Niagara. The combined impact was $0.01 per common share. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations was $0.28 per common share, the same as the year-ago quarter. However, it's worth noting in comparison with the year-ago period, that the current quarter includes $23 million in higher provision expense and $18 million of lower principal investing gains, given such strong finish to the year. Also, not on the slide is the revenue growth. For the quarter, revenue was up 2% from the prior year and up 3% from the prior quarter. For the full year, Key had a revenue growth of over 3%, reflecting the success we've had in growing our businesses. This revenue growth has allowed us to grow our pre-provision net revenues 5% year-over-year. I will cover the other items in the rest of my presentations. I'm now turning over to Slide 7. Average loan balances were up $3 billion or 5% compared to year ago quarter and up $295 million from third quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.7 billion or 14% compared to the prior year, or $510 million or 2% on annualized from the third quarter. During the current quarter, we continued to generate strong customer growth that was muted by pay down of lines with existing customers. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office totaled $71.5 million for the fourth quarter 2015, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase is reflective of growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. Compared to the third quarter 2015, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office increased by $1.5 billion. The growth was driven by both seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and certificate of. 
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter 2015. Net interest margin was 2.87%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter 2014. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in net interest margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $12 million and the net interest margin was unchanged. The increase in net interest income and the stable net interest margin were to attributable to higher earnings asset yields and loan fees and while net interest margin was stable, it was negatively impacted by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by short-term composite growth. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income which accounted for 44% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $485 million, down $5 million or 1% from the prior year and up $15 million or 3% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to lower net gains from principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market viability. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million increase in other income gains in our real estate capital line of business along with growth in some of Key's other core fee base businesses including $4 million of higher cards of payments income and a $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees. Compared to last quarter, noninterest income improved by $15 million. That was notably due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, marking a strong finish to a record year. Additionally, other income was higher once again related to gains in real estate capital. And corporate owned life insurance increased reflecting normal seasonality. These items were offset by lower net gains from principal investing. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on this slide, expense levels were elevated and reflected a number of moving pieces. I'll start with the current quarter. Noninterest expense was $736 million which included $20 million of charges consisting of $10 million of efficiency charges primarily related to branch closures and severance, $6 million of merger-related cost and $4 million of pension settlement income. Next, compared to the fourth quarter last year, our noninterest expense is up 5%. The increase was primarily attributed to $20 million of higher personnel costs, reflecting an $11 million increase in benefit cost. The investments in client fee and personnel cost across the company and higher severance expense. We also had a $6 million of merger-related costs. And finally, linked quarter expenses were up 2% related to $12 million of higher incentive compensation related to strong capital market performance and end-of-the-year accruals, $6 million of merger-related costs incurred in the fourth quarter and $6 million of higher efficiency related charges. These were partially offset by the lower pension settlement charge. Once again, the current quarter included elevated levels of expenses reflecting the cost noted above in normal seasonal trends. We would expect first quarter expense levels to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Also, we would expect the full year 2016 expenses to be relatively stable in 2015, adjusted for merger-related costs. 
Turning to slide 12, net charge-offs were $37 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter which continued to be below our target range. In the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses of $45 million, slightly above the level of charge-offs, reflecting current trends in our portfolio. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were both down relative to prior quarter and year ago period. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for total loan losses represented 1.33% of period and loans and 206% coverage of our nonperforming loans. It's also worth noting that our energy exposure is small, representing 2% of our total portfolio and has performed in line with our expectations. We built reserves throughout the year which currently represents 6% of outstanding loans. 
Turning to slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at December 31, 2015 at 10.95%. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $460 million of common shares. We expect share repurchases and an increased dividend to be included in our upcoming 2015 CCAR submission. 
Now moving on to slide 14. For our 2016 outlook, we're providing guidance on our standalone Key operations. In 2016, we expect to continue to drive positive operating leverage. Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from a strength of our commercial businesses. We anticipate that net interest income growth and the low single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit rates. It's also important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases. Noninterest income is expected to be up in mid-single percentage range for the year. This assumes continued strong improvement in investing banking and debt placement fees as well as continued growth in cards and payment income. We're also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains for 2016. Full year reported expenses should be relatively stable in 2015. We would expect to see normal seasonal trends and expenses with first quarter expenses down significantly from the fourth quarter level. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to maintain a stable level of allowance of total loans. And finally, we expect our dividend to increase in the second quarter to $0.085 per share and the 2016 CCAR plan to include both common share repurchases and an increased dividend. Our guidance explicitly impact our merger-related charges as well as the acquisition of First Niagara. If the acquisition closes in the third quarter as planned, we would expect EPS impact with a slight dilution of 1% to 2% in 2016 and accretive in 2017.

And you're correct that I'm even more confident. We feel even stronger about the path and quality of what will be the value of this combined company. The cost-savings, as you know, we had targeted $400 million or approximately 40% of their cost and while it is early days, the integration teams have been identified and are working 2 by 2 to map out those plans and as we really understand the underlying cost structure, particularly in technology, operations, vendor expense, there are significant savings in all of those areas that probably contribute to over 40% of that $400 million. So out of the gate as we look for the path, while nothing is ever easy, we also see very real savings that are easy to garner and will also be realize fairly early within the time after our acquisition. We're also looking complementary  business capabilities and revenue synergies that we continue to gain confidence about the value that will be created there.

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; E.J. Burke; and Dennis Devine, co-presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter closes out what has been a very significant year for our company. We improved our operating performance, continued our credit discipline, maintained our strong capital position and made investments that will drive future growth and profitability. For the year, Key generated positive operating leverage that we believe was among the strongest in our peer group. Our revenues were up 3% and our pre-provision net revenue was up 5%, both compared to the prior year. These results reflect our success in continuing to grow and expand client relationships in both the Community Bank and the Corporate Bank, and these new clients contributed to our 5% growth in average loans and 12% growth in CF&A balances. We also increased our core fee-based income including investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up 12%, another record year for us. Corporate services and cards and payments were both up over 10%. And I think it's worth noting that these are areas where we have made recent investments that are generating growth and positive returns. 
Expense management also remained an area of focus. During the year, we continue to execute on opportunities to rightsize our business, reduce occupancy costs and improve operational efficiency. Expense trends reflect our investment to drive future growth and profitability as well as merger-related charges and those related to our continuous improvement and efficiency efforts. Investments during the year included remixing our headcount to increase client-facing roles in both the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank. We also enhanced our payments capability, which have driven strong growth in purchase and prepaid card as well as a 13% increase year-over-year in credit card sales. And we continue to invest in our digital and mobile offerings as well as ongoing enhancements to our compliance and regulatory processes. These were good investments that help drive our revenue growth in 2015 and they will make an even larger contribution in the future as they fully mature. While these investments, including the addition of 60 senior bankers in our Corporate and Community Bank as well as Pacific Crest Securities, position us for growth, they offset some of the efficiency improvements made in other areas of our company last year. Importantly, we remain committed to further improvement in the targets that we have established. 
Credit quality remained a good story in 2015 but nonperforming loans down for the year and net charge-offs of 24 basis points which is below our targeted range. We remain committed to strong risk management practices and staying true to our relationship focus. The final item on the slide is capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 11% which we believe positions us well for the 2016 CCAR process and we expect both share repurchases and a dividend increase to be part of the capital plan we will submit. 
I'm now moving to Slide 4 which provides some highlights of our announced acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to make good progress as we move toward our anticipated closing in the third quarter of this year. Under the leadership of Chris Gorman, we have established integration teams with some of the top talent from both Key and First Niagara and these teams have been focused on developing detailed assessments and moving forward with our integration plan. As we move through these early stages, I'm even more confident in this being the right opportunity for Key and our ability to realize the cost-savings. The combined company will generate attractive financial returns and create value for our shareholders and accelerates our progress towards becoming a high-performing regional bank. And although not included in our financial projections, we will realize additional value from revenue synergies that will also add to the financial performance. We look forward to sharing more developments with you in the coming quarters as we move towards closing. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to close my remarks by saying that it was a good year for Key. We executed against our strategic and financial goals and took steps to accelerate our progress going forward. I'm proud of our team and of our performance and I'm excited about the opportunity that we have ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Don, to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results. Don?"

That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, K",1468,"Thanks, and I'm on Slide 6. That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Key incurred $10 million of charges related to pension settlement and the acquisition of First Niagara. The combined impact was $0.01 per common share. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations was $0.28 per common share, the same as the year-ago quarter. However, it's worth noting in comparison with the year-ago period, that the current quarter includes $23 million in higher provision expense and $18 million in lower principal investing gains, giving such strong finish to the year. Also, not on the slide is the revenue growth. For the quarter, revenue was up 2% from the prior year and up 3% from the prior quarter. For the full year, Key had a revenue growth of over 3%, reflecting the success we've had in growing our businesses. This revenue growth has allowed us to grow our pre-provision net revenues 5% year-over-year. I will cover the other items in the rest of my presentations. I'm now turning over to Slide 7. Average loan balances were up $3 billion or 5% compared to year ago quarter and up $295 million from the third quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.7 billion or 14% compared to the prior year, or $510 million or 2% on annualized from the third quarter. During the current quarter, we continue to generate strong customer growth that was muted by pay downs of lines with existing customers. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office totaled $71.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2015, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase is reflective of growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. Compared to the third quarter 2015, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office increased by $1.5 billion. The growth was driven by both seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and  certificates of deposit. 
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter 2015. Net interest margin was 2.87%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter 2014. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in net interest margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $12 million and the net interest margin was unchanged. The increase in net interest income and the stable net interest margin were to attributable to higher earnings asset yields and loan fees and while net interest margin was stable, it was negatively impacted by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by short-term commercial deposit growth. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income which accounted for 44% of our total revenues. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $485 million, down $5 million or 1% from the prior year and up $15 million or 3% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to lower net gains from principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market variability. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million increase in other income gains in our real estate capital line of business along with growth in some of Key's other core fee based businesses including $4 million of higher cards and payments income and a $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees. Compared to last quarter, noninterest income improved by $15 million. That was notably due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, marking a strong finish to a record year. Additionally, other income was higher once again related to gains in real estate capital. And corporate-owned life insurance increased reflecting normal seasonality. These items were offset by lower net gains from principal investing. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on this slide, expense levels were elevated and reflected a number of moving pieces. I'll start with the current quarter. Noninterest expense was $736 million which included $20 million of charges consisting of $10 million of efficiency charges primarily related to branch closures and severance, $6 million of merger-related costs and $4 million of pension settlement expense. Next, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our noninterest expense is up 5%. The increase was primarily attributed to $20 million of higher personnel costs, reflecting an $11 million increase in benefit cost. The investments in client fee and personnel cost across the company and higher severance expense. We also had a $6 million of merger-related costs. And finally, linked quarter expenses were up 2% related to $12 million of higher incentive compensation related to strong capital market performance and end-of-the-year accruals, $6 million of merger-related costs incurred in the fourth quarter and $6 million of higher efficiency related charges. These were partially offset by the lower pension settlement charge. Once again, the current quarter included elevated levels of expenses reflecting the cost noted above and normal seasonal trends. We would expect first quarter expense levels to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Also, we would expect the full year 2016 expenses to be relatively stable in 2015, adjusted for merger-related costs. 
Turning to slide 12, net charge-offs were $37 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter which continues to be below our target range. In the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses of $45 million, slightly above the level of charge-offs, reflecting current trends in our portfolio. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were both down relative to prior quarter and year ago period. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for total loan losses represented 1.33% of period and loans and 206% coverage of our nonperforming loans. It's also worth noting that our energy exposure is small, representing 2% of our total portfolio and has performed in line with our expectations. We built reserves throughout the year which currently represent 6% of outstanding loans. 
Turning to slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at December 31, 2015 at 10.95%. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $460 million of common shares. We expect share repurchases and an increased dividend to be included in our upcoming 2015 CCAR submission. 
Now moving on to slide 14. For our 2016 outlook, we're providing guidance on our standalone Key operations. In 2016, we expect to continue to drive positive operating leverage. Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from the strength in our commercial businesses. We anticipate that net interest income growth and the low single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit range. It's also important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases. Noninterest income is expected to be up in mid-single percentage range for the year. This assumes continued strong improvement in investing banking and debt placement fees as well as continued growth in cards and payments incomes. We're also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains for 2016. Full year reported expenses should be relatively stable in 2015. We would expect to see normal seasonal trends and expenses with first quarter expenses down significantly from the fourth quarter level. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to maintain a stable level of allowance to total loans. And finally, we expect our dividend to increase in the second quarter to $0.085 per share and the 2016 CCAR plan to include both common share repurchases and an increased dividend. Our guidance explicitly impact our merger-related charges as well as the acquisition of First Niagara. If the acquisition closes in the third quarter as planned, we would expect EPS impact with a slight dilution of 1% to 2% in 2016 and accretive in 2017. With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

And you're correct that I'm even more confident. We feel even stronger about the path and quality of what will be the value of this combined company. On the cost-savings, as you know, we had targeted $400 million or approximately 40% of their cost and while it is early days, the integration teams have been identified and are working 2 by 2 to map out those plans and as we really understand the underlying cost structure, particularly in technology, operations, vendor expense, there are significant savings in all of those areas that probably contribute to over 40% of that $400 million. So out of the gate as we look for the path, while nothing is ever easy, we also see very real savings that are easy to garner and will also be realized fairly early within the time after our acquisition. We're also looking at complementary  business capabilities and revenue synergies that we continue to gain confidence about the value that will be created there. So in all, I do think you hear a continued tone of confidence as well as a path forward that we feel strongly about."

So just, in general, as we firm up path and plans, I think we're feeling stronger and better and if we look at the revenue synergies, we quoted in our call that we had in late October around $300 million in revenue synergies was the number that we had put out there. Obviously with some offsetting costs on net numbers, less than that around 200. And I think what we're really seeing is more confidence around the places and the way that we would realize those revenue synergies. We see the complementary nature of our business models.

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; E.J. Burke and Dennis Devine, co-presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter closes out what has been a very significant year for our company. We improved our operating performance, continued our credit discipline, maintained our strong capital position and made investments that will drive future growth and profitability. For the year, Key generated positive operating leverage that we believe was among the strongest in our peer group. Our revenues were up 3% and our pre-provision net revenue was up 5%, both compared to the prior year. These results reflect our success in continuing to grow and expand client relationships in both the Community Bank and the Corporate Bank, and these new clients contributed to our 5% growth in average loans and 12% growth in CF&A balances. We also increased our core fee-based income including investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up 12%, another record year for us. Corporate services and cards and payments were both up over 10%. And I think it's worth noting that these are areas where we have made recent investments that are generating growth and positive returns. 
Expense management also remained an area of focus. During the year, we continue to execute on opportunities to rightsize our business, reduce occupancy costs and improve operational efficiency. Expense trends reflect our investment to drive future growth and profitability as well as merger-related charges and those related to our continuous improvement and efficiency efforts. Investments during the year included remixing our headcount to increase client-facing roles in both the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank. We also enhanced our payments capability, which have driven strong growth in purchase and prepaid card as well as a 13% increase year-over-year in credit card sales. And we continue to invest in our digital and mobile offerings as well as ongoing enhancements to our compliance and regulatory processes. These were good investments that help drive our revenue growth in 2015 and they will make an even larger contribution in the future as they fully mature. While these investments, including the addition of 60 senior bankers in our Corporate and Community Bank as well as Pacific Crest Securities, position us for growth, they offset some of the efficiency improvements made in other areas of our company last year. Importantly, we remain committed to further improvement in the targets that we have established. 
Credit quality remained a good story in 2015, with nonperforming loans down for the year and net charge-offs of 24 basis points, which is below our targeted range. We remain committed to strong risk management practices and staying true to our relationship focus. The final item on this slide is capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 11%, which we believe positions us well for the 2016 CCAR process and we expect both share repurchases and a dividend increase to be part of the capital plan we will submit. 
I'm now moving to Slide 4, which provides some highlights of our announced acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to make good progress as we move toward our anticipated closing in the third quarter of this year. Under the leadership of Chris Gorman, we have established integration teams with some of the top talent from both Key and First Niagara and these teams have been focused on developing detailed assessments and moving forward with our integration plan. As we move through these early stages, I'm even more confident in this being the right opportunity for Key and our ability to realize the cost savings. The combined company will generate attractive financial returns and create value for our shareholders and accelerates our progress towards becoming a high-performing regional bank. And although not included in our financial projections, we will realize additional value from revenue synergies that will also add to the financial performance. We look forward to sharing more developments with you in the coming quarters as we move towards closing. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to close my remarks by saying that it was a good year for Key. We executed against our strategic and financial goals and took steps to accelerate our progress going forward. I'm proud of our team and of our performance and I'm excited about the opportunity that we have ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Don, to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results. Don?"

That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, K",1465,"Thanks, and I'm on Slide 6. That said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share. This compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Key incurred $10 million of charges related to pension settlement and the acquisition of First Niagara. The combined impact was $0.01 per common share. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations was $0.28 per common share, the same as the year-ago quarter. However, it's worth noting in comparison with the year-ago period, that the current quarter includes $23 million in higher provision expense and $18 million in lower principal investing gains, giving us a strong finish to the year. Also, not on the slide is the revenue growth. For the quarter, revenue was up 2% from the prior year and up 3% from the prior quarter. For the full year, Key had a revenue growth of over 3%, reflecting the success we've had in growing our businesses. This revenue growth has allowed us to grow our pre-provision net revenues 5% year-over-year. I will cover the other items in the rest of my presentation. I'm now turning over to Slide 7. Average loan balances were up $3 billion or 5% compared to year ago quarter and up $295 million from the third quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.7 billion or 14% compared to the prior year, or $510 million or 2% on annualized from the third quarter. During the current quarter, we continue to generate strong customer growth that was muted by pay downs of lines with existing customers. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $71.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2015, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase is reflective of growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. Compared to the third quarter 2015, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office increased by $1.5 billion. The growth was driven by both seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and  certificates of deposit. 
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter 2015. Net interest margin was 2.87%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter 2014. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in net interest margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $12 million and the net interest margin was unchanged. The increase in net interest income and the stable net interest margin were attributable to higher earnings asset yields and loan fees and while net interest margin was stable, it was negatively impacted by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by short-term commercial deposit growth. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of our total revenues. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $485 million, down $5 million or 1% from the prior year and up $15 million or 3% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to lower net gains from principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market variability. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million increase in other income gains in our real estate capital line of business along with growth in some of Key's other core fee based businesses, including $4 million of higher cards and payments income and a $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees. Compared to last quarter, noninterest income improved by $15 million. That was notably due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, marking a strong finish to a record year. Additionally, other income was higher once again related to gains in real estate capital. And corporate-owned life insurance increased, reflecting normal seasonality. These items were offset by lower net gains from principal investing. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on this slide, expense levels were elevated and reflected a number of moving pieces. I'll start with the current quarter. Noninterest expense was $736 million, which included $20 million of charges consisting of $10 million of efficiency charges primarily related to branch closures and severance, $6 million of merger-related costs and $4 million of pension settlement expense. Next, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our noninterest expense is up 5%. The increase was primarily attributed to $20 million of higher personnel costs, reflecting an $11 million increase in benefit cost, the investments in client-facing personnel cost across the company and higher severance expense. We also had a $6 million of merger-related costs. And finally, linked quarter expenses were up 2% related to $12 million of higher incentive compensation related to strong capital market performance and end-of-the-year accruals, $6 million of merger-related costs incurred in the fourth quarter and $6 million of higher efficiency related charges. These were partially offset by the lower pension settlement charge. Once again, the current quarter included elevated levels of expenses reflecting the cost noted above and normal seasonal trends. We would expect first quarter expense levels to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Also, we would expect the full year 2016 expenses to be relatively stable in 2015, adjusted for merger-related costs. 
Turning to slide 12, net charge-offs were $37 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. In the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses of $45 million, slightly above the level of charge-offs, reflecting current trends in our portfolio. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were both down relative to prior quarter and year ago period. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for total loan losses represented 1.33% of period-end loans and 206% coverage of our nonperforming loans. It's also worth noting that our energy exposure is small, representing 2% of our total portfolio and has performed in line with our expectations. We've built reserves throughout the year, which currently represent 6% of outstanding loans. 
Turning to slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at December 31, 2015 at 10.95%. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $460 million of common shares. We expect share repurchases and an increased dividend to be included in our upcoming 2015 CCAR submission. 
Now moving on to slide 14. For our 2016 outlook, we're providing guidance on our standalone Key operations. In 2016, we expect to continue to drive positive operating leverage. Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from the strength in our commercial businesses. We anticipate that net interest income growth and the low single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit range. It's also important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases. Noninterest income is expected to be up in mid-single percentage range for the year. This assumes continued strong improvement in investing banking and debt placement fees as well as continued growth in cards and payments incomes. We're also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains for 2016. Full year reported expenses should be relatively stable in 2015. We would expect to see normal seasonal trends and expenses with first quarter expenses down significantly from the fourth quarter level. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to maintain a stable level of allowance to total loans. And finally, we expect our dividend to increase in the second quarter to $0.085 per share and the 2016 CCAR plan to include both common share repurchases and an increased dividend. Our guidance explicitly impact our merger-related charges as well as the acquisition of First Niagara. If the acquisition closes in the third quarter as planned, we would expect EPS impact be a slight dilution of 1% to 2% in 2016 and accretive in 2017. With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

And you're correct that I'm even more confident. We feel even stronger about the path and quality of what will be the value of this combined company. On the cost savings, as you know, we had targeted $400 million or approximately 40% of their cost and while it is early days, the integration teams have been identified and are working 2 by 2 to map out those plans and as we really understand the underlying cost structure, particularly in technology, operations, vendor expense, there are significant savings in all of those areas that probably contribute to over 40% of that $400 million. So out of the gate as we look for the path, while nothing is ever easy, we also see very real savings that are easy to garner and will also be realized fairly early within the time after our acquisition. We're also looking at complementary business capabilities and revenue synergies that we continue to gain confidence about the value that will be created there.

And I believe that they're obviously in the process with the Department of Justice, who will make the determinations on the divestiture numbers and working through our plans and our process and I think we will be a good and significant partner and good for those communities and those customers."

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm nor turning to Slide 3. Our first quarter results reflect momentum in our core businesses and continued progress on our strategic initiative despite a more challenging operating environment. Excluding merger-related expense, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter and grew pre-provision net revenue by 6%. We also lowered our cash efficiency ratio for the first quarter to 64%. Revenue was up 3% from last year, driven by a 6% growth in net interest income. Average loans were up 5% from the year-ago period with the 12% increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans. 
In our noninterest income, we saw year-over-year improvement in areas such as corporate services and cards and payments, reflecting investments that we had made in these businesses. Market sensitive businesses, such as investment banking and debt placement fees, were impacted by the weak Capital Market environment. Don will provide more detail and our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments. 
Credit quality measures this quarter were impacted by migration and our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting current market conditions, the rest of the loan portfolio continued to perform well and within our expectations with overall net charge-offs remaining below our targeted range. We maintained our strong capital position and subject to board approval, we struck an increase in a quarterly common stock dividend to $0.085 per share in May of this year. 
Slide 4  is an update on our First Niagara acquisition. We were very pleased that the shareholders of both companies approved the merger last month. This was an important step in the process and we appreciate the support of our shareholders. We also announced our community benefits plan, which is a comprehensive blueprint  for the community investments that we will be making over the next 5 years. This underscores our commitment to the areas we serve across our footprint. 
I have commented before about the cultural fit between Key and First Niagara and that continues to be evident in the way our 2 teams are working together. We have made significant progress in developing detailed business plans and our target environment, including talent assessment and selection. 
As we move forward, I'm even more confident in achieving our cost savings and revenue synergies and ultimately delivering on our commitment for valued creation for our shareholders. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. 
We look forward to completing the next stages of the approval process and continued to expect the acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year. Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our first quarter results. Don?"

First quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.24 per common share after adjusting for $24 million or $0.02 per common share with the expense related to the acquisition of First Niagara. This compared to $0.26 in",1399,"Thanks, and I'm on Slide 6. 
First quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.24 per common share after adjusting for $24 million or $0.02 per common share with the expense related to the acquisition of First Niagara. This compared to $0.26 in the year-ago period and $0.27 from the fourth quarter. As Beth mentioned, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio. The rest of our loan portfolio continued to perform well. 
Also worth noting is despite weak market conditions, our revenue was up 3% from the prior year. After excluding merger-related expense, pre-provision net revenue was up 6% and we generated positive operating leverage compared to the first quarter of last year. I will cover the other line items in the rest of my presentation so now, I'm turning over to Slide 7. 
Average loan balances were up $2.6 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $580 million from the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. 
Average CF&A loans were up $3.3 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $706 million or 2% on annualized compared to the fourth quarter. 
Continued on to Slide 8. From the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $71.6 billion from the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $2.8 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business, inflows from commercial and consumer clients and growth in time deposits. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office increased by $131 million. Growth in time deposits was largely offset by decline in the seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients that we experienced during the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $612 million for the first quarter of 2016 and the net interest margin was 2.89%. These results compared to the taxable equivalent net next income of $577 million and the net interest margin of 2.91% for the first quarter of 2015. The 6% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields. The net interest margin remain relatively stable, benefiting from higher earning asset yields which were offset by higher levels of liquidity and various other items including lower loan fees. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, net interest income was relatively stable and the net interest margin increased by 2 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin was attributed to the higher earning asset balances and an increase in earning asset yields, which was largely the result of loan portfolio repricing to the higher short-term rates that resulted from the December rate price. The benefit of these items were partially offset by various other items including lower loan fees and lower yield on our Fed stocks. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the first quarter was $431 million, down $6 million or 1% from the prior year and $54 million or 11% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year, which attributed to a lower net gains from principal investing of $29 million, which were offset by continued growth in several of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting our relationship strategy in the investments we have been making in our products and capabilities. 
Relative to a year-ago period, corporate services income was up 16%. Cards and payments was up 10% and service charges on deposit accounts increased by 7%. Compared to the last quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by weaker capital market activity, which resulted in $56 million on lower investment banking in debt placement fees. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned earlier, reported noninterest expense of $703 million includes $24 million of expense related to the acquisition First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $679 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed break out of our major-related expense in the appendix of the materials. 
Compared to the first quarter of last year and after adjusting for the merger-related expense, noninterest expense was up $10 million or 1%. The increase was primarily attributed to slight increases across various nonpersonnel areas. Excluding merger-related expense, link-quarter expenses were down $51 million or 7%. The decrease largely reflected lower performance-based compensation, marketing and business services and professional fees. 
Our cash efficiency ratio was 64% in the first quarter after adjusting for merger-related expense with results showing improvement from both the year-ago period and the linked quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. As Beth mentioned earlier, credit quality measures were impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio while the rest of the portfolio's continued to perform well. Our increased level of provision this quarter reflects the build in the reserves for oil  and gas credits to 8% of outstanding. 
Overall, net charge-offs were $46 million or 31 basis points of average loans in the first quarter. Which continues to be below our targeted range. First quarter provision for credit losses was $89 million, an increase of $54 million from the year-ago period and $44 million from the linked quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the prior quarter and year-ago period. 90% of the change was related to our oil and gas portfolio. 
At March 31, our reserves loan losses represented 1.37% of period end loans and 122% coverage of nonperforming loans. Despite this movement that we saw in the first quarter, our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year with provision levels modestly exceeding that charge-offs which will support the continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period in loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter level. 
I'm turning to Slide 13. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at March 31, 2016, at 11.11%. We submitted our capital plan during the current quarter which included both common share repurchases and increased dividends. We look forward to sharing the results with you. 
As previously communicated, we plan to increase our common share dividend in the second quarter of this year by 13% subject to board approval. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Our 2016 outlook is for the stand-alone key operations and does not reflect the impact of First Niagara nor the merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the first quarter results. Importantly, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage and our outlook for the remainder of the year has not changed. 
Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from strength in our commercial businesses. We now anticipate net interest income growth in the low to mid-single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from further rate increases. This increase in our outlook reflects the benefit from the December rate rise flowing through the bottom line. 
With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit range. It's important to note that we have assumed the deposit rates will increase with future rate increases. 
Noninterest income is expected to be up in the low to mid-single digit percentage range for the year, which primarily reflects weaker revenue from our market sensitive businesses in the first quarter. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in investment banking and debt placement fees as well as other core fee-based businesses where our investments are continuing to mature such as cards and payments. We are also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains in 2016. Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable in 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to remain below our target range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to modestly exceed net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance of percentage of period end loans was anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter results. 
With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Shawn?"

And so, where we see pressure on the margin, it's more from the ballooning up of that liquidity position on the balance sheet, that we are seeing poor performance in the other categories maintained and loan prices have stabilized across our footprint and -- so we would expect to have a relatively stable margin absent any changes in liquidity."

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our first quarter results reflect momentum in our core businesses and continued progress on our strategic initiative despite a more challenging operating environment. Excluding merger-related expense, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter and grew pre-provision net revenue by 6%. We also lowered our cash efficiency ratio for the first quarter to 64%. Revenue was up 3% from last year, driven by a 6% growth in net interest income. Average loans were up 5% from the year-ago period with a 12% increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans.
In our noninterest income, we saw year-over-year improvement in areas such as corporate services and cards and payments, reflecting investments that we had made in these businesses. Market-sensitive businesses, such as investment banking and debt placement fees, were impacted by the weak capital market environment. Don will provide more detail and our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Credit quality measures this quarter were impacted by migration in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting current market conditions. The rest of the loan portfolio continue to perform well and within our expectations, with overall net charge-offs remaining below our targeted range. We maintained our strong capital position and subject to board approval, we've got an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.085 per share in May of this year.
Slide 4 is an update on our First Niagara acquisition. We were very pleased that the shareholders of both companies approved the merger last month. This was an important step in the process and we appreciate the support of our shareholders. We also announced our Community Benefits Plan, which is a comprehensive blueprint for the community investments that we will be making over the next 5 years. This underscores our commitment to the areas we serve across our footprint.
I have commented before about the cultural fit between Key and First Niagara, and that continues to be evident in the way our 2 teams are working together. We have made significant progress in developing detailed business plans and our target environment, including talent assessment and selection.
As we move forward, I'm even more confident in achieving our cost savings and revenue synergies and ultimately delivering on our commitment for value creation for our shareholders. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital.
We look forward to completing the next stages of the approval process and continue to expect the acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our first quarter results. Don?"

First quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.24 per common share after adjusting for $24 million or $0.02 per common share of expense related to the acquisition of First Niagara. This compared to $0.26 in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the fourth quarter. As Beth mentioned, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio. The rest of our loan portfolio continued to perform well.
Also worth noting is despite weak market conditions, our revenue was up 3% from the prior year. After excluding merger-related expense, pre-provision net revenue was up 6%, and we generated positive operating leverage compared to the first quarter of last year. I will cover the other line items in the rest of my presentation so now I'm turning to Slide 7.
Average loan balances were up $2.6 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $580 million from the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments.
Average CF&A loans were up $3.3 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $706 million or 2% on annualized compared to the fourth quarter.
Continuing on to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $71.6 billion for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $2.8 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business, inflows from commercial and consumer clients and growth in time deposits. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, increased by $131 million. Growth in time deposits was largely offset by decline in the seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients that we experienced during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $612 million for the first quarter of 2016 and the net interest margin was 2.89%. These results compare to the taxable equivalent net interest income of $577 million and a net interest margin of 2.91% for the first quarter of 2015. The 6% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields. The net interest margin remained relatively stable, benefiting from higher earning asset yields, which were offset by higher levels of liquidity and various other items including lower loan fees.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, net interest income was relatively stable and the net interest margin increased by 2 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin was attributed to the higher earning asset balances and an increase in earning asset yields, which was largely the result of loan portfolio repricing to the higher short-term rates that resulted from the December rate rise. The benefit of these items was partially offset by various other items, including lower loan fees and lower yield on our Fed stock.
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the first quarter was $431 million, down $6 million or 1% from the prior year and $54 million or 11% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to the lower net gains from principal investing of $29 million, which were offset by continued growth in several of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting our relationship strategy and the investments we have been making in our products and capabilities.
Relative to year-ago period, corporate services income was up 16%. Cards and payments was up 10% and service charges on deposit accounts increased by 7%. Compared to the last quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by weaker capital markets activity, which resulted in $56 million in lower investment banking and debt placement fees.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned earlier, reported noninterest expense of $703 million includes $24 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $679 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of the materials.
Compared to the first quarter of last year and after adjusting for the merger-related expense, noninterest expense was up $10 million or 1%. The increase was primarily attributed to slight increases across various nonpersonnel areas. Excluding merger-related expense, linked quarter expenses were down $51 million or 7%. The decrease largely reflected lower performance-based compensation, marketing and business services and professional fees.
Our cash efficiency ratio was 64% in the first quarter after adjusting for merger-related expense, with results showing improvement from both the year-ago period and the linked quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. As Beth mentioned earlier, credit quality measures were impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio while the rest of the portfolio have continued to perform well. Our increased level of provision this quarter reflects the build in the reserves for oil and gas credit to 8% of outstanding.
Overall, net charge-offs were $46 million or 31 basis points of average loans in the first quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. First quarter provision for credit losses was $89 million, an increase of $54 million from the year-ago period and $44 million from the linked quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the prior quarter and year-ago period as 90% of the change was related to our oil and gas portfolio.
At March 31, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.37% of period end loans and 122% coverage of our nonperforming loans. Despite this movement we saw in the first quarter, our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter level.
I'm turning to Slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at March 31, 2016 at 11.11%. We submitted our capital plan during the current quarter which included both common share repurchases and increased dividends. We look forward to sharing the results with you.
As previously communicated, we plan to increase our common share dividend in the second quarter of this year by 13%, subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. Our 2016 outlook is for the stand-alone Key operations and does not reflect the impact of First Niagara nor the merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the first quarter results. Importantly, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage and our outlook for the remainder of the year has not changed.
Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from strength in our commercial businesses. We now anticipate net interest income growth in the low to mid-single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from further rate increases. This increase in our outlook reflects the benefit from the December rate rise flowing through to the bottom line.
With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit range. It's important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases.
Noninterest income is expected to be up in the low to mid-single digit percentage range for the year, which primarily reflects weaker revenue from our market-sensitive businesses in the first quarter. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in investment banking and debt placement fees as well as other core fee-based businesses where our investments are continuing to mature such as cards and payments. We are also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains in 2016.
Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to remain below our target range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to modestly exceed net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter results.
With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Sean?"

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our first quarter results reflect momentum in our core businesses and continued progress on our strategic initiative despite a more challenging operating environment. Excluding merger-related expense, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter and grew pre-provision net revenue by 6%. We also lowered our cash efficiency ratio for the first quarter to 64%. Revenue was up 3% from last year, driven by a 6% growth in net interest income. Average loans were up 5% from the year-ago period with a 12% increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans.
In our noninterest income, we saw year-over-year improvement in areas such as corporate services and cards and payments, reflecting investments that we had made in these businesses. Market-sensitive businesses, such as investment banking and debt placement fees, were impacted by the weak capital market environment. Don will provide more detail and our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Credit quality measures this quarter were impacted by migration in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting current market conditions. The rest of the loan portfolio continued to perform well and within our expectations, with overall net charge-offs remaining below our targeted range. We maintained our strong capital position and subject to board approval, we've got an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.085 per share in May of this year.
Slide 4 is an update on our First Niagara acquisition. We were very pleased that the shareholders of both companies approved the merger last month. This was an important step in the process and we appreciate the support of our shareholders. We also announced our Community Benefits Plan, which is a comprehensive blueprint for the community investments that we will be making over the next 5 years. This underscores our commitment to the areas we serve across our footprint.
I have commented before about the cultural fit between Key and First Niagara, and that continues to be evident in the way our 2 teams are working together. We have made significant progress in developing detailed business plans and our target environment, including talent assessment and selection.
As we move forward, I'm even more confident in achieving our cost savings and revenue synergies and ultimately delivering on our commitment for value creation for our shareholders. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital.
We look forward to completing the next stages of the approval process and continue to expect the acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our first quarter results. Don?"

First quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.24 per common share after adjusting for $24 million or $0.02 per common share of expense related to the acquisition of First Niagara. This compared to $0.26 in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the fourth quarter. As Beth mentioned, this quarter's results were negatively impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio. The rest of our loan portfolio continued to perform well.
Also worth noting is despite weak market conditions, our revenue was up 3% from the prior year. After excluding merger-related expense, pre-provision net revenue was up 6%, and we generated positive operating leverage compared to the first quarter of last year. I will cover the other line items in the rest of my presentation so now I'm turning to Slide 7.
Average loan balances were up $2.6 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $580 million from the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments.
Average CF&A loans were up $3.3 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $706 million or 2% on annualized compared to the fourth quarter.
Continuing on to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $71.6 billion for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $2.8 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business, inflows from commercial and consumer clients and growth in time deposits. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, increased by $131 million. Growth in time deposits was largely offset by decline in the seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients that we experienced during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $612 million for the first quarter of 2016 and the net interest margin was 2.89%. These results compare to the taxable equivalent net interest income of $577 million and a net interest margin of 2.91% for the first quarter of 2015. The 6% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields. The net interest margin remained relatively stable, benefiting from higher earning asset yields, which were offset by higher levels of liquidity and various other items including lower loan fees.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, net interest income was relatively stable and the net interest margin increased by 2 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin was attributed to the higher earning asset balances and an increase in earning asset yields, which was largely the result of loan portfolio repricing to the higher short-term rates that resulted from the December rate rise. The benefit of these items was partially offset by various other items, including lower loan fees and lower yield on our Fed stock.
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the first quarter was $431 million, down $6 million or 1% from the prior year and $54 million or 11% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to the lower net gains from principal investing of $29 million, which were offset by continued growth in several of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting our relationship strategy and the investments we have been making in our products and capabilities.
Relative to the year-ago period, corporate services income was up 16%. Cards and payments was up 10% and service charges on deposit accounts increased by 7%. Compared to the last quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by weaker capital markets activity, which resulted in $56 million in lower investment banking and debt placement fees.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned earlier, reported noninterest expense of $703 million includes $24 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $679 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of the materials.
Compared to the first quarter of last year and after adjusting for the merger-related expense, noninterest expense was up $10 million or 1%. The increase was primarily attributed to slight increases across various nonpersonnel areas. Excluding merger-related expense, linked quarter expenses were down $51 million or 7%. The decrease largely reflected lower performance-based compensation, marketing and business services and professional fees.
Our cash efficiency ratio was 64% in the first quarter after adjusting for merger-related expense, with results showing improvement from both the year-ago period and the linked quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. As Beth mentioned earlier, credit quality measures were impacted by the migration in our oil and gas portfolio while the rest of the portfolio has continued to perform well. Our increased level of provision this quarter reflects the build in the reserves for oil and gas credit to 8% of outstanding.
Overall, net charge-offs were $46 million or 31 basis points of average loans in the first quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. First quarter provision for credit losses was $89 million, an increase of $54 million from the year-ago period and $44 million from the linked quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the prior quarter and year-ago period as 90% of the change was related to our oil and gas portfolio.
At March 31, our reserves through loan losses represented 1.37% of period end loans and 122% coverage of our nonperforming loans. Despite this movement we saw in the first quarter, our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter level.
I'm turning to Slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at March 31, 2016 at 11.11%. We submitted our capital plan during the current quarter which included both common share repurchases and increased dividends. We look forward to sharing the results with you.
As previously communicated, we plan to increase our common share dividend in the second quarter of this year by 13%, subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. Our 2016 outlook is for the stand-alone Key operations and does not reflect the impact of First Niagara nor the merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the first quarter results. Importantly, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage and our outlook for the remainder of the year has not changed.
Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from strength in our commercial businesses. We now anticipate net interest income growth in the low to mid-single digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from further rate increases. This increase in our outlook reflects the benefit from the December rate rise flowing through to the bottom line.
With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid-single digit range. It's important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases.
Noninterest income is expected to be up in the low to mid-single digit percentage range for the year, which primarily reflects weaker revenue from our market-sensitive businesses in the first quarter. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in investment banking and debt placement fees as well as other core fee-based businesses where our investments are continuing to mature such as cards and payments. We are also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains in 2016.
Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to modestly exceed net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our first quarter results.
With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Sean?"

Excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage and improved pre-provision net revenue relative to the year-ago period. Revenue was stable with the same period last year and up 3% from the last quarter despite low interest rates and challenging market conditions. Loan growth was solid again this quarter, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Our core fee-based businesses continued to perform well, with corporate services and cards and payment both posting double-digit year-over-year gain. Market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees, improved from last quarter but are below the record pace of the year-ago period. Commercial mortgage banking continues to generate strong growth while other areas are being impacted by challenging market conditions. Don will provide more detail and our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Expenses have remained well-controlled and our ongoing efficiency efforts have allowed us to continue to invest to drive growth. Credit quality was a good story once again, with our net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted level. And capital management remains an area of focus. We increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.085 [ph] per share or 13% during the quarter and we were pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We expect to resume common share repurchases after we complete our acquisition. And subject to board approval, we plan to increase our common share dividend to $0.095 [ph] per share next year. 
Now I'm turning to Slide 4. We're very excited to be on a path to close our First Niagara acquisition, which is expected on August 1. The merger of Key Bank and First Niagara Bank is planned for the fourth quarter subject to the approval by the OCC. We would also expect systems and client conversions to take place during the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the plans for our combined branch network, including the consolidation of over 100 existing First Niagara and Key branches. We also plan to continue to invest and grow in New York, which will include in-sourcing some functions and our build-out of the First Niagara's residential mortgage and auto lending businesses to support our broader franchise. 
I've been extremely pleased with the way our 2 companies have worked together to position us to be successful in meeting our commitments to clients, communities, employees and shareholders. And I remain confident in, and committed to, achieving our financial targets and creating value for our shareholders in this low growth, low rate environment. The combination of Key and First Niagara accelerates our performance beyond what either company could've otherwise achieved. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. 
And as I've said before, our internal targets for cost savings is higher than our external target of $400 million, and developments this quarter have only reinforced our confidence in achieving our commitments. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. Don?"
329376,365601112,1011826,"KeyCorp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thanks, Beth. I'm on Slide 6.

This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which ex",1577,"Thanks, Beth. I'm on Slide 6. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per common share after excluding $0.04 of merger-related expense. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which excluded $0.02 of merger-related expense. 
As Beth mentioned, excluding merger expense, we grew pre-provisioned net revenue and generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenue was stable from the same period last year and up 3% from the first quarter despite the headwind from low interest rates and the challenging market conditions. Core expenses were well managed. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for merger expense was 64.8%. I'll cover many of these items in this slide and the rest of my presentation so I'm now turning it to Slide 7. 
Average loan balances were up $3.2 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $1 billion or 2% from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.6 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $1 billion or 3% on annualized for the first quarter. 
Continuing to Slide 8. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $73.9  billion [ph] for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.6 billion [ph] compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business and commercial deposit inflows. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion. Higher escrow balances, short-term inflows from our commercial clients and core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise contributed to the linked quarter increase.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $605 million for the second quarter of 2016 and net interest margin was 2.76%. These results compared to the tax book equivalent net interest income of $591 million and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the second quarter of 2015. The 2% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields from the securities and derivatives portfolio. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, net interest income was down 1% and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. The net interest margin reduction in the second quarter was driven by excess liquidity, which was a function of 3 things,the first two of which related to our upcoming First Niagara acquisition. First, we retained higher cash balances needed for funding the First Niagara purchase price and branch divestiture. Second, liquidity was held to position our balance sheet to put LCR compliance following the close of the acquisition. And third, during the quarter we had elevated levels of short term escrow deposits some of which are seasonal. Higher levels of liquidity translated into a $2.1 billion linked-quarter increase in our account at the Federal Reserve, which resulted in a 7 basis point decline in our net interest margin. The average balances for the quarter of $5.6 billion was well above the historic levels of approximately $1 billion. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the second quarter was $473 million, down $15 million or 3% from the prior year and up $42 million or 10% from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year was largely attributed to lower investment banking and debt placement fees. Although we saw growth in commercial mortgage banking fees, it was more than offset by weaker market conditions resulting in lower revenue compared to the prior year -- excuse me, year-ago record quarter.
In the second half of the year, we expect good overall growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, more in line with our regional outlook for the business. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've made over the last few years. Corporate Services income was up 23% and cards and payments income was up 11% from the year-ago period. We've also seen a positive trend in service charges on deposit accounts.
The growth in other income reflected a number of items, including higher gains from real estate investment -- real-estate-related investments. Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by $27 million in the higher investment banking and debt placement fees. We also saw growth across various other line items, including cards and payments, corporate services, service charge on deposit accounts and net gains from principal investing.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see in this slide, reported noninterest expense of $751 million includes $45 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $706 million for the quarter. We have provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the second quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger-related expense, noninterest expense was down $5 million or 1%. The decline reflects lower performance-based compensation, occupancy and business services and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher expense related to certain real estate investments and increased nonmerger-related marketing.
Excluding the merger-related expense, linked-quarter expenses were up $27 million or 4%. The increase is primarily in nonpersonnel, including other expense and nonmerger-related marketing. The quarter also reflected an increase in personnel expense related to higher performance-based compensation. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall net charge-offs were $43 million or 28 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was $52 [ph] million, an increase of $11 million in the year-ago period and a decrease of $37 million from a linked-quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the year-ago period but decreased from the prior quarter. At June 30, 2016, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period in loans and 138% coverage of nonperforming loans. Our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. We continue to anticipate the allowance as a percentage of period in loans to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%, up from 10.7% in the year-ago period. As Beth highlighted, disciplined capital management remains a priority for us. Last month, we announced a 13% increase on our quarterly common share dividend. We were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan, which included up to $350 million in share purchases and had an additional increase to our common share dividend next year subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. The top portion of the slide provides our 2016 outlook for standalone Key, excluding merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the second quarter results. Despite continued headwinds from our lower interest rates and more challenging market conditions, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect average loans to grow in the mid-single digit range driven by continued strength in our commercial businesses. Net interest income growth should be in the low to mid-single digit range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of the year compared to both the first half of this year and the year-ago period. Our guidance now reflects the weaker capital markets conditions experienced in the first half of this year. Importantly, our expectations for the second half of this year remain in line with our original outlook. Based on this, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable to up low single digits for the year. 
Full year reported expenses excluding merger-related expense should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to be modestly -- to modestly exceed net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of the period end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our second quarter level. 
We've also included some guidance for the expected impact of First Niagara, which is scheduled to close next week on August 1. Branch and systems conversions are anticipated for the fourth quarter, after which we expect to begin to see the cost savings. We expect majority of the benefit to be realized in 2017. 
Revenue and expense should be generally consistent with the First Niagara's first quarter operating results, including 10-Q adjusted for the 5-month period they would be part of Key. Expenses will also reflect approximately $30 million of incremental amortization expense in 2016.
Key share comp will also increase by about 240 million shares from the acquisition. 
As Beth said, we are excited about the opportunity to bring these 2 companies together and our confidence in delivering our financial commitments remain strong.

So as we talked therefore, 7 basis points is the increased liquidity level, which really didn't drive any net interest income from it. So that was purely a balance sheet component. The rest of it were up 5 basis points. Typically in the second quarter we would see an increase in loan fees. And this quarter, we actually saw a decline. And so that swing from what our original expectations would've been to what we actually realized cost us about 3 basis points or about $5 million in the quarter compared to what we would have expected going into the quarter. And then beyond that, we had 2 other components that impacted it, one was the full quarter impact of the nonaccrual loans related to oil and gas, and then a third piece really was the reinvestment in our investment portfolio. But the securities that we were buying had an average yield of about 1.9% compared to, say, 20 or 30 basis points higher than that. That would've been our expectation and that probably caused us an additional basis point during the quarter. And so those are the primary factors. As far as the growth going forward, while we're not counting on recouping the loan fees that we didn't realize in the current quarter, we would expect to see some normal trends as far as seasonal activity and continued strong loan growth that we've been able to produce so far this year."

And I will tell you it is consistent with the way we have been planning for both our internal targets as well as you heard us discuss, our confidence about being able to meet the cost synergies. Some piece of how we have structured bringing these 2 companies together is around the notion that we can leverage what is an attractive, well skilled, low-cost workforce in Buffalo and in Western New York. So we are looking at -- we indicated in sourcing some functions or work that is done elsewhere, not necessarily just within First Niagara but within broader KeyCorp, and that work could be moved to Buffalo and utilized, as I said, that low-cost talent base. We also looked at some of our operations network within, and we'll consolidate those into Western New York and bring down costs or jobs elsewhere within Key. And then the biggest driver over time for the job number is what we talked about was the fact that they have residential mortgage from originations through servicing as well as the indirect auto business, both of which, one was a business we were trying to stand up with Key and one that was new to Key. And that we will build on those businesses within Western New York as we scale on the cost of our broader franchise, which we expect will create opportunities for many folks in Western New York to support that and the corresponding revenue that we would expect again as we introduced that to the broader Key franchise and there will be some leverage on the call center capabilities. So as we look at it, again it is a portfolio of businesses between Key and First Niagara and there were some opportunities to really leverage Western New York. But consistent with how we've thought of our expense synergies, we get there in a very, very solid path through the ability to look at in sourcing growth. And as we look at the mix of the 400 [ph] and Don will have some thoughts to add to this as well, a big, big driver of that is vendor savings. There is the outsourced technology environment at First Niagara is a huge driver of the 400 [ph]. And then as we look at additional outsourcing to bring that work back in, we really are being able to get a huge piece of that pass through exiting third-party relationships."

Good morning, and welcome to the KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. 
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum in our core businesses and the progress we have made to complete the acquisition of First Niagara on August 1. Excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage and improved pre-provision net revenue relative to the year-ago period. Revenue was stable with the same period last year and up 3% from the last quarter despite low interest rates and challenging market conditions. Loan growth was solid again this quarter, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Our core fee-based businesses continued to perform well, with corporate services and cards and payment both posting double-digit year-over-year gain. Market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees, improved from last quarter but are below the record pace of the year-ago period. Commercial mortgage banking continues to generate strong growth while other areas are being impacted by challenging market conditions. Don will provide more detail in our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Expenses have remained well controlled and our ongoing efficiency efforts have allowed us to continue to invest to drive growth. Credit quality was a good story once again, with our net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted level. And capital management remains an area of focus. We increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.085 per share or 13% during the quarter and we were pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We expect to resume common share repurchases after we complete our acquisition, and subject to board approval, we plan to increase our common share dividend to $0.095 per share next year. 
Now I'm turning to Slide 4. We're very excited to be on a path to close our First Niagara acquisition, which is expected on August 1. The merger of KeyBank and First Niagara Bank is planned for the fourth quarter, subject to the approval by the OCC. We would also expect systems and client conversions to take place during the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the plans for our combined branch network, including the consolidation of over 100 existing First Niagara and Key branches. We also plan to continue to invest and grow in New York, which will include in-sourcing some functions and our build-out of the First Niagara's residential mortgage and auto lending businesses to support our broader franchise. I've been extremely pleased with the way our 2 companies have worked together to position us to be successful in meeting our commitments to clients, communities, employees and shareholders. And I remain confident in, and committed to, achieving our financial targets and creating value for our shareholders in this slow growth, low rate environment. The combination of Key and First Niagara accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. 
And as I've said before, our internal target for cost savings is higher than our external target of $400 million, and developments this quarter have only reinforced our confidence in achieving our commitments. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. Don?"

Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per common share after excluding $0.04 of merger-related expense. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which excluded $0.02 of merger-related expense. As Beth mentioned, excluding merger expense, we grew pre-provision net revenue and generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenue was stable from the same period last year and up 3% from the first quarter despite the headwinds from low interest rates and the challenging market conditions. Core expenses were well managed. Our efficiency ratio, adjusted for merger expense, was 64.8%. I'll cover many of these items on this slide and the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to Slide 7. 
Average loan balances were up $3.2 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $1 billion or 2% from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.6 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $1 billion or 3% on annualized for the first quarter. 
Continuing to Slide 8. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $73.9  billion for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.6 billion compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business and commercial deposit inflows. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion. Higher escrow balances, short-term inflows from our commercial clients and core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise contributed to the linked-quarter increase.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $605 million for the second quarter of 2016, and net interest margin was 2.76%. These results compare to a taxable equivalent net interest income of $591 million and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the second quarter of 2015. The 2% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields from the securities and derivatives portfolio. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, net interest income was down 1% and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. The net interest margin reduction in the second quarter was driven by excess liquidity, which was a function of 3 things, the first two of which related to our upcoming First Niagara acquisition. First, we retained higher cash balances needed for funding the First Niagara purchase price and branch divestiture. Second, liquidity was held to position our balance sheet to put LCR compliance following the close of the acquisition. And third, during the quarter, we had elevated levels of short-term escrow deposits, some of which are seasonal. Higher levels of liquidity translated into a $2.1 billion linked-quarter increase in our account at the Federal Reserve, which resulted in a 7 basis point decline in our net interest margin. The average balances for the quarter of $5.6 billion was well above the historic levels of approximately $1 billion. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the second quarter was $473 million, down $15 million or 3% from the prior year and up $42 million or 10% from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year was largely attributed to lower investment banking and debt placement fees. Although we saw growth in commercial mortgage banking fees, it was more than offset by weaker market conditions resulting in lower revenue compared to the prior year -- excuse me, year-ago record quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect good overall growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, more in line with our original outlook for the business. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we made over the last few years. Corporate services income was up 23% and cards and payments income was up 11% from the year-ago period. We've also seen a positive trend in service charges on deposit accounts. The growth in other income reflected a number of items, including higher gains from real estate investment -- real estate-related investments. Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by $27 million in higher investment banking and debt placement fees. We also saw growth across various other line items, including cards and payments, corporate services, service charge on deposit accounts and net gains from principal investing.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see in this slide, reported noninterest expense of $751 million includes $45 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $706 million for the quarter. We have provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the second quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger-related expense, noninterest expense was down $5 million or 1%. The decline reflects lower performance-based compensation, occupancy and business services and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher expense related to certain real estate investments and increased nonmerger-related marketing. Excluding the merger-related expense, linked-quarter expenses were up $27 million or 4%. The increase is primarily in nonpersonnel, including other expense and nonmerger-related marketing. The quarter also reflected an increase in personnel expense related to higher performance-based compensation. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall net charge-offs were $43 million or 28 basis points of the average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was $52 million, an increase of $11 million in the year-ago period and a decrease of $37 million from a linked-quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the year-ago period but decreased from the prior quarter. At June 30, 2016, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period-end loans and a 138% coverage of nonperforming loans. Our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. We continue to anticipate the allowance as a percentage of period-end loans to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%, up from 10.7% in the year-ago period. As Beth highlighted, disciplined capital management remains a priority for us. Last month, we announced a 13% increase on our quarterly common share dividend. We were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan, which included up to $350 million in share purchases and an additional increase to our common share dividend next year subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. The top portion of the slide provides our 2016 outlook for standalone Key, excluding merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the second quarter results. Despite continued headwinds from our lower interest rates and more challenging market conditions, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect average loans to grow in the mid-single digit range driven by continued strength in our commercial businesses. Net interest income growth should be in the low to mid-single digit range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of the year compared to both the first half of this year and a year-ago period. Our guidance now reflects the weaker capital markets conditions experienced in the first half of this year. Importantly, our expectations for the second half of this year remain in line with our original outlook. Based on this, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable to up low single digits for the year. 
Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to be modestly -- to modestly exceed net charge-offs which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our second quarter level. 
We've also included some guidance for the expected impact of First Niagara, which is scheduled to close next week on August 1. Branch and systems conversions are anticipated for the fourth quarter, after which we expect to begin to see the cost savings. We expect majority of the benefit to be realized in 2017. Revenue and expense should be generally consistent with the First Niagara's first quarter operating results, included in their 10-Q adjusted for the 5-month period they would be part of Key. Expenses will also reflect approximately $30 million of incremental amortization expense in 2016. 
Key's share count will also increase by about 240 million shares from the acquisition. 
As Beth said, we are excited about the opportunity to bring these 2 companies together and our confidence in delivering our financial commitments remain strong.

So as we talked therefore, 7 basis points is related to the increased liquidity level, which really didn't drive any net interest income from it and so that was purely a balance sheet component. The rest of it about 5 basis points, typically in the second quarter we would see an increase in loan fees. And this quarter, we actually saw a decline. And so that swing from what our original expectations would have been to what we actually realized, cost us about 3 basis points or about $5 million in the quarter compared to what we would have expected going into the quarter. And then beyond that, we had 2 other components that impacted it. One was the full quarter impact of the nonaccrual loans related to oil and gas. And then a third piece really was the reinvestment in our investment portfolio. But the securities that we were buying had an average yield of about 1.9% compared to, say, 20 or 30 basis points higher than that, that would have been our expectation and that probably cost us an additional basis point during the quarter. And so those are the primary factors. As far as the growth going forward, while we're not counting on recouping the loan fees that we didn't realize in the current quarter, we would expect to see some normal trends as far as seasonal activity and continued strong loan growth that we had been able to produce so far this year."

And I will tell you that it is consistent with the way we have been planning for both our internal targets as well as you've heard us discuss our confidence about being able to meet the cost synergies. Some piece of how we have structured bringing these 2 companies together is around the notion that we can leverage what is an attractive, well skilled, low-cost workforce in Buffalo and in Western New York. So we are looking at -- we indicated in-sourcing some functions or work that is done elsewhere, not necessarily just within First Niagara but within broader KeyCorp, and that, that work could be moved to Buffalo and utilize, as I said, that low-cost talent base. We've also looked at some of our operations network within Key, and we'll consolidate those into Western New York and bring down costs or jobs elsewhere within Key. And then the biggest driver over time for the job number is what we talked about was the fact that they have residential mortgage from origination through servicing as well as the indirect auto business, both of which -- one was a business we are trying to stand up within Key and one that is new to Key. And that we will build on those businesses within Western New York as we scale them across our broader franchise, which we expect will create opportunities for many folks in Western New York to support that and the corresponding revenue that we would expect to gain as we introduced that to the broader Key franchise and then there will be some leveraging on the call center capabilities. So as we look at it, again it is a portfolio of businesses between Key and First Niagara and there were some opportunities to really leverage Western New York. But consistent with how we thought of our expense synergies, we get there in a very, very solid path through the ability to look at in-sourcing growth. And as we look at the mix of the $400 million and Don will have some thoughts to add on this as well, a big, big driver of that is vendor savings. There is -- the outsourced technology environment at First Niagara is a huge driver of the $400 million. And then as we look at additional outsourcing to bring that work back in, we really are being able to get a huge piece of that pass through exiting third-party relationships."

Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum in our core businesses and the progress we have made to complete the acquisition of First Niagara on August 1. Excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage and improved pre-provision net revenue relative to the year-ago period. Revenue was stable with the same period last year and up 3% from the last quarter despite low interest rates and challenging market conditions. Loan growth was solid again this quarter, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Our core fee-based businesses continued to perform well, with corporate services and cards and payments both posting double-digit year-over-year gains. Market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees, improved from last quarter but are below the record pace of the year-ago period. Commercial mortgage banking continues to generate strong growth while other areas are being impacted by challenging market conditions. Don will provide more detail in our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Expenses have remained well controlled and our ongoing efficiency efforts have allowed us to continue to invest to drive growth. Credit quality was a good story once again, with our net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted level. And capital management remains an area of focus. We increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.085 per share or 13% during the quarter and we were pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We expect to resume common share repurchases after we complete our acquisition, and subject to board approval, we plan to increase our common share dividend to $0.095 per share next year. 
Now I'm turning to Slide 4. We're very excited to be on a path to close our First Niagara acquisition, which is expected on August 1. The merger of KeyBank and First Niagara Bank is planned for the fourth quarter, subject to the approval by the OCC. We would also expect systems and client conversions to take place during the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the plans for our combined branch network, including the consolidation of over 100 existing First Niagara and Key branches. We also plan to continue to invest and grow in New York, which will include in-sourcing some functions and our build-out of the First Niagara's residential mortgage and auto lending businesses to support our broader franchise. I've been extremely pleased with the way our 2 companies have worked together to position us to be successful in meeting our commitments to clients, communities, employees and shareholders. And I remain confident in, and committed to, achieving our financial targets and creating value for our shareholders in this slow growth, low rate environment. The combination of Key and First Niagara accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. 
And as I've said before, our internal target for cost savings is higher than our external target of $400 million, and developments this quarter have only reinforced our confidence in achieving our commitments. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. Don?"

This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which",1572,"Thanks, Beth. I'm on Slide 6. 
Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per common share after excluding $0.04 of merger-related expense. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which excluded $0.02 of merger-related expense. As Beth mentioned, excluding merger expense, we grew pre-provision net revenue and generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenue was stable from the same period last year and up 3% from the first quarter despite the headwinds from low interest rates and the challenging market conditions. Core expenses were well managed. Our efficiency ratio, adjusted for merger expense, was 64.8%. I'll cover many of these items on this slide and the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to Slide 7. 
Average loan balances were up $3.2 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $1 billion or 2% from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.6 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $1 billion or 3% on annualized for the first quarter. 
Continuing to Slide 8. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $73.9 billion for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.6 billion compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business and commercial deposit inflows. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion. Higher escrow balances, short-term inflows from our commercial clients and core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise contributed to the linked-quarter increase.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $605 million for the second quarter of 2016, and net interest margin was 2.76%. These results compare to a taxable equivalent net interest income of $591 million and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the second quarter of 2015. The 2% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields from the securities and derivatives portfolio. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, net interest income was down 1% and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. The net interest margin reduction in the second quarter was driven by excess liquidity, which was a function of 3 things, the first 2 of which are related to our upcoming First Niagara acquisition. First, we retained higher cash balances needed for funding the First Niagara purchase price and branch divestiture. Second, liquidity was held to position our balance sheet for LCR compliance following the close of the acquisition. And third, during the quarter, we had elevated levels of short-term escrow deposits, some of which are seasonal. Higher levels of liquidity translated into a $2.1 billion linked-quarter increase in our account at the Federal Reserve, which resulted in a 7 basis point decline in our net interest margin. The average balances for the quarter of $5.6 billion was well above the historic levels of approximately $1 billion. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the second quarter was $473 million, down $15 million or 3% from the prior year and up $42 million or 10% from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year was largely attributed to lower investment banking and debt placement fees. Although we saw growth in commercial mortgage banking fees, it was more than offset by weaker market conditions resulting in lower revenue compared to the prior year -- excuse me, year-ago record quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect good overall growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, more in line with our original outlook for the business. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've made over the last few years. Corporate services income was up 23% and cards and payments income was up 11% from the year-ago period. We've also seen a positive trend in service charges on deposit accounts. The growth in other income reflected a number of items, including higher gains from real estate investment -- real estate-related investments. Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by $27 million in higher investment banking and debt placement fees. We also saw growth across various other line items, including cards and payments, corporate services, service charge on deposit accounts and net gains from principal investing.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see in this slide, reported noninterest expense of $751 million includes $45 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $706 million for the quarter. We have provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the second quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger-related expense, noninterest expense was down $5 million or 1%. The decline reflects lower performance-based compensation, occupancy and business services and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher expense related to certain real estate investments and increased nonmerger-related marketing. Excluding the merger-related expense, linked-quarter expenses were up $27 million or 4%. The increase is primarily in nonpersonnel, including other expense and nonmerger-related marketing. The quarter also reflected an increase in personnel expense related to higher performance-based compensation. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall net charge-offs were $43 million or 28 basis points of the average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was $52 million, an increase of $11 million from the year-ago period and a decrease of $37 million from the linked quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the year-ago period but decreased from the prior quarter. At June 30, 2016, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period-end loans and a 138% coverage of nonperforming loans. Our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. We continue to anticipate the allowance as a percentage of period-end loans to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%, up from 10.7% in the year-ago period. As Beth highlighted, disciplined capital management remains a priority for us. Last month, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly common share dividend. We were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan, which included up to $350 million in share purchases and an additional increase to our common share dividend next year subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. The top portion of the slide provides our 2016 outlook for standalone Key, excluding merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the second quarter results. Despite continued headwinds from our lower interest rates and more challenging market conditions, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect average loans to grow in the mid-single digit range driven by continued strength in our commercial businesses. Net interest income growth should be in the low to mid-single digit range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of the year compared to both the first half of this year and a year-ago period. Our guidance now reflects the weaker capital markets conditions experienced in the first half of this year. Importantly, our expectations for the second half of this year remain in line with our original outlook. Based on this, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable to up low single digits for the year. 
Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to be modestly -- to modestly exceed net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our second quarter level. 
We've also included some guidance for the expected impact of First Niagara, which is scheduled to close next week on August 1. Branch and systems conversions are anticipated for the fourth quarter, after which we expect to begin to see the cost savings. We expect majority of the benefit to be realized in 2017. Revenue and expense should be generally consistent with the First Niagara's first quarter operating results, included in their 10-Q adjusted for the 5-month period that they would be part of Key. Expenses will also reflect approximately $30 million of incremental amortization expense in 2016. 
Key's share count will also increase by about 240 million shares from the acquisition. 
As Beth said, we are excited about the opportunity to bring these 2 companies together and our confidence in delivering on our financial commitments remain strong. 
With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. John?"

So as we've talked therefore, 7 basis points is related to the increased liquidity level, which really didn't drive any net interest income from it and so that was purely a balance sheet component. The rest of it, about 5 basis points, typically in the second quarter we would see an increase in loan fees. And this quarter, we actually saw a decline. And so that swing from what our original expectations would have been to what we actually realized, cost us about 3 basis points or about $5 million in the quarter compared to what we would have expected going into the quarter. And then beyond that, we had 2 other components that impacted it. One was the full quarter impact of the nonaccrual loans related to the oil and gas. And then a third piece really was the reinvestment in our investment portfolio. But the securities that we were buying had an average yield of about 1.9% compared to, say, 20 or 30 basis points higher than that; that would have been our expectation and that probably cost us an additional basis point during the quarter. And so those are the primary factors. As far as the growth going forward, while we're not counting on recouping the loan fees that we didn't realize in the current quarter, we would expect to see some normal trends as far as seasonal activity and continued strong loan growth that we had been able to produce so far this year."

And I will tell you that it is consistent with the way we have been planning for both our internal targets as well as, you've heard us discuss, our confidence about being able to meet the cost synergies. Some piece of how we have structured bringing these 2 companies together is around the notion that we can leverage what is an attractive, well-skilled, low-cost workforce in Buffalo and in Western New York. So we are looking at -- we indicated in-sourcing some functions or work that is done elsewhere, not necessarily just within First Niagara but within broader KeyCorp, and that, that work could be moved to Buffalo and utilize, as I said, that low-cost talent base. We've also looked at some of our operations network within Key, and we'll consolidate those into Western New York and bring down costs or jobs elsewhere within Key. And then the biggest driver over time for the job number is what we talked about was the fact that they have residential mortgage from origination through servicing as well as the indirect auto business, both of which -- one was a business we are trying to stand up within Key and one that is new to Key. And that we will build on those businesses within Western New York as we scale them across our broader franchise, which we expect will create opportunities for many folks in Western New York to support that and the corresponding revenue that we would expect to gain as we introduce that to the broader Key franchise, and then there will be some leveraging on the call center capabilities. So as we look at it, again it is a portfolio of businesses between Key and First Niagara and there were some opportunities to really leverage Western New York. But consistent with how we thought of our expense synergies, we get there in a very, very solid path through the ability to look at in-sourcing growth. And as we look at the mix of the $400 million and Don will have some thoughts to add on this as well, a big, big driver of that is vendor savings. There is -- the outsourced technology environment at First Niagara is a huge driver of the $400 million. And then as we look at additional outsourcing to bring that work back in, we really are being able to get a huge piece of that pass through exiting third-party relationships."

That was highly unusual and we would expect a normal recurring level to be in the $1 million to $2 million a quarter as opposed to $7 million to $8 million. And so that did inflate that expense category and is why we are showing a significant increase there."

But we also had several situations where there would be prepayments in the commercial mortgage servicing area that had cash idle for weeks at a time, and that resulted in some over or outsized increases in those deposit balances. As far as our commercial customers, we're still seeing and hearing from them that they continue to be fairly cautious.

Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum in our core businesses and the progress we have made to complete the acquisition of First Niagara on August 1. Excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage and improved pre-provision net revenue relative to the year-ago period. Revenue was stable with the same period last year and up 3% from the last quarter despite low interest rates and challenging market conditions. Loan growth was solid again this quarter, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Our core fee-based businesses continued to perform well, with corporate services and cards and payments both posting double-digit year-over-year gains. Market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees, improved from last quarter but are below the record pace of the year-ago period. Commercial mortgage banking continues to generate strong growth while other areas are being impacted by challenging market conditions. Don will provide more detail in our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.
Expenses have remained well controlled and our ongoing efficiency efforts have allowed us to continue to invest to drive growth. Credit quality was a good story once again, with our net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted level. And capital management remains an area of focus. We increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.085 per share or 13% during the quarter and we were pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We expect to resume common share repurchases after we complete our acquisition, and subject to board approval, we plan to increase our common share dividend to $0.095 per share next year. 
Now I'm turning to Slide 4. We're very excited to be on a path to close our First Niagara acquisition, which is expected on August 1. The merger of KeyBank and First Niagara Bank is planned for the fourth quarter, subject to the approval by the OCC. We would also expect systems and client conversions to take place during the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the plans for our combined branch network, including the consolidation of over 100 existing First Niagara and Key branches. We also plan to continue to invest and grow in New York, which will include in-sourcing some functions and our build-out of the First Niagara's residential mortgage and auto lending businesses to support our broader franchise. I've been extremely pleased with the way our 2 companies have worked together to position us to be successful in meeting our commitments to clients, communities, employees and shareholders. And I remain confident in, and committed to, achieving our financial targets and creating value for our shareholders in this slow growth, low rate environment. The combination of Key and First Niagara accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS upon the full realization of cost savings. We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. 
And as I've said before, our internal target for cost savings is higher than our external target of $400 million, and developments this quarter have only reinforced our confidence in achieving our commitments. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. Don?"

This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which",1572,"Thanks, Beth. I'm on Slide 6. 
Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per common share after excluding $0.04 of merger-related expense. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which excluded $0.02 of merger-related expense. As Beth mentioned, excluding merger expense, we grew pre-provision net revenue and generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenue was stable from the same period last year and up 3% from the first quarter despite the headwinds from low interest rates and the challenging market conditions. Core expenses were well managed. Our efficiency ratio, adjusted for merger expense, was 64.8%. I'll cover many of these items on this slide and the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to Slide 7. 
Average loan balances were up $3.2 billion or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $1 billion or 2% from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.6 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $1 billion or 3% on annualized for the first quarter. 
Continuing to Slide 8. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $73.9 billion for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.6 billion compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business and commercial deposit inflows. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion. Higher escrow balances, short-term inflows from our commercial clients and core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise contributed to the linked-quarter increase.
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $605 million for the second quarter of 2016, and net interest margin was 2.76%. These results compare to a taxable equivalent net interest income of $591 million and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the second quarter of 2015. The 2% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields from the securities and derivatives portfolio. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, net interest income was down 1% and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. The net interest margin reduction in the second quarter was driven by excess liquidity, which was a function of 3 things, the first 2 of which are related to our upcoming First Niagara acquisition. First, we retained higher cash balances needed for funding the First Niagara purchase price and branch divestiture. Second, liquidity was held to position our balance sheet for LCR compliance following the close of the acquisition. And third, during the quarter, we had elevated levels of short-term escrow deposits, some of which are seasonal. Higher levels of liquidity translated into a $2.1 billion linked-quarter increase in our account at the Federal Reserve, which resulted in a 7 basis point decline in our net interest margin. The average balances for the quarter of $5.6 billion was well above the historic levels of approximately $1 billion. 
Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the second quarter was $473 million, down $15 million or 3% from the prior year and up $42 million or 10% from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year was largely attributed to lower investment banking and debt placement fees. Although we saw growth in commercial mortgage banking fees, it was more than offset by weaker market conditions resulting in lower revenue compared to the prior year -- excuse me, year-ago record quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect good overall growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, more in line with our original outlook for the business. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've made over the last few years. Corporate services income was up 23% and cards and payments income was up 11% from the year-ago period. We've also seen a positive trend in service charges on deposit accounts. The growth in other income reflected a number of items, including higher gains from real estate investment -- real estate-related investments. Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income was most notably impacted by $27 million in higher investment banking and debt placement fees. We also saw growth across various other line items, including cards and payments, corporate services, service charge on deposit accounts and net gains from principal investing.
Turning to Slide 11. As you can see in this slide, reported noninterest expense of $751 million includes $45 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $706 million for the quarter. We have provided a detailed break out of our merger-related expense in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the second quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger-related expense, noninterest expense was down $5 million or 1%. The decline reflects lower performance-based compensation, occupancy and business services and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher expense related to certain real estate investments and increased nonmerger-related marketing. Excluding the merger-related expense, linked-quarter expenses were up $27 million or 4%. The increase is primarily in nonpersonnel, including other expense and nonmerger-related marketing. The quarter also reflected an increase in personnel expense related to higher performance-based compensation. 
Turning to Slide 12. Overall net charge-offs were $43 million or 28 basis points of the average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was $52 million, an increase of $11 million from the year-ago period and a decrease of $37 million from the linked quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to the year-ago period but decreased from the prior quarter. At June 30, 2016, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period-end loans and a 138% coverage of nonperforming loans. Our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. We continue to anticipate the allowance as a percentage of period-end loans to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%, up from 10.7% in the year-ago period. As Beth highlighted, disciplined capital management remains a priority for us. Last month, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly common share dividend. We were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan, which included up to $350 million in share purchases and an additional increase to our common share dividend next year subject to board approval.
Moving on to Slide 14. The top portion of the slide provides our 2016 outlook for standalone Key, excluding merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the second quarter results. Despite continued headwinds from our lower interest rates and more challenging market conditions, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect average loans to grow in the mid-single digit range driven by continued strength in our commercial businesses. Net interest income growth should be in the low to mid-single digit range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of the year compared to both the first half of this year and a year-ago period. Our guidance now reflects the weaker capital markets conditions experienced in the first half of this year. Importantly, our expectations for the second half of this year remain in line with our original outlook. Based on this, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable to up low single digits for the year. 
Full year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense, should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to be modestly -- to modestly exceed net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our second quarter level. 
We've also included some guidance for the expected impact of First Niagara, which is scheduled to close next week on August 1. Branch and systems conversions are anticipated for the fourth quarter, after which we expect to begin to see the cost savings. We expect majority of the benefit to be realized in 2017. Revenue and expense should be generally consistent with the First Niagara's first quarter operating results, included in their 10-Q adjusted for the 5-month period that they would be part of Key. Expenses will also reflect approximately $30 million of incremental amortization expense in 2016. 
Key's share count will also increase by about 240 million shares from the acquisition. 
As Beth said, we are excited about the opportunity to bring these 2 companies together and our confidence in delivering on our financial commitments remain strong.

So as we've talked therefore, 7 basis points is related to the increased liquidity level, which really didn't drive any net interest income from it and so that was purely a balance sheet component. The rest of it, about 5 basis points, typically in the second quarter we would see an increase in loan fees. And this quarter, we actually saw a decline. And so that swing from what our original expectations would have been to what we actually realized, cost us about 3 basis points or about $5 million in the quarter compared to what we would have expected going into the quarter. And then beyond that, we had 2 other components that impacted it. One was the full quarter impact of the nonaccrual loans related to the oil and gas. And then a third piece really was the reinvestment in our investment portfolio. But the securities that we were buying had an average yield of about 1.9% compared to, say, 20 or 30 basis points higher than that; that would have been our expectation and that probably cost us an additional basis point during the quarter. And so those are the primary factors. As far as the growth going forward, while we're not counting on recouping the loan fees that we didn't realize in the current quarter, we would expect to see some normal trends as far as seasonal activity and continued strong loan growth that we had been able to produce so far this year."

And I will tell you that it is consistent with the way we have been planning for both our internal targets as well as, you've heard us discuss, our confidence about being able to meet the cost synergies. Some piece of how we have structured bringing these 2 companies together is around the notion that we can leverage what is an attractive, well-skilled, low-cost workforce in Buffalo and in Western New York. So we are looking at -- we indicated in-sourcing some functions or work that is done elsewhere, not necessarily just within First Niagara but within broader KeyCorp, and that, that work could be moved to Buffalo and utilize, as I said, that low-cost talent base. We've also looked at some of our operations network within Key, and we'll consolidate those into Western New York and bring down costs or jobs elsewhere within Key. And then the biggest driver over time for the job number is what we talked about was the fact that they have residential mortgage from origination through servicing as well as the indirect auto business, both of which -- one was a business we are trying to stand up within Key and one that is new to Key. And that we will build on those businesses within Western New York as we scale them across our broader franchise, which we expect will create opportunities for many folks in Western New York to support that and the corresponding revenue that we would expect to gain as we introduce that to the broader Key franchise, and then there will be some leveraging on the call center capabilities. So as we look at it, again it is a portfolio of businesses between Key and First Niagara and there were some opportunities to really leverage Western New York. But consistent with how we thought of our expense synergies, we get there in a very, very solid path through the ability to look at in-sourcing growth. And as we look at the mix of the $400 million and Don will have some thoughts to add on this as well, a big, big driver of that is vendor savings. There is -- the outsourced technology environment at First Niagara is a huge driver of the $400 million. And then as we look at additional outsourcing to bring that work back in, we really are being able to get a huge piece of that pass through exiting third-party relationships."

And so in order to make sure that they are LCR compliant as part of Key, our plans are to shift out that $3.5 billion of credit-oriented securities and have their investment portfolio look more like legacy Key. And so that process would take place throughout the third quarter, and we believe that we'd be in a good position at that point in time. As far as Key, that -- we have been continuing to reassess our overall strategy as far as the duration of the portfolio given these low rates and the timing of certain purchases, but the composition and nature of that portfolio really hasn't changed over the last couple of quarters."

Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. 
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measure, and covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I'm now turning to Slide 3. Third quarter was pivotal for our company in terms of both financial results and executing our strategy. We successfully closed our acquisition of First Niagara, adding over $35 billion in assets, 300 new branches and $1 million new customers to Key and while a lot of time and resources have been devoted to making sure our acquisition and conversion went smoothly, we've also stayed focus on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses. Importantly, both our community back and Corporate Bank delivered strong results this quarter. And Don will cover our outlook in his remarks, but let me just say, we remain confident in meeting our commitments, including the achieving the financial targets for our acquisition. 
I am now moving to Slide 4. Before I provide highlights of our quarter, I do want to share that throughout our presentation, we have provided important details and transparency for key stand-alone operations and the impact of our acquisitions. As we move forward, we will be reporting consolidated results with Key and First Niagara combined. But this quarter, we thought it would be useful to provide additional detail. Slide 4 provides some highlights for stand-alone Key and the strong performance we saw this quarter. Our Community Bank and Corporate Bank are performing well and we are realizing benefit from the investments we have made in recent years. As shown in our recent earnings release, we reported EPS of $0.16 and it is $0.30, excluding the impact of merger-related charges. First Niagara operations were relatively neutral to our EPS this quarter. 
Compared to the year-ago period, stand-alone Key delivered positive operating leverage and we are well-positioned as we move forward as a combined company, having generated positive operating leverage for 9 of the past 11 quarters on a stand-alone basis. Revenue grew 6% from the prior year as we benefited from another quarter of solid loan and deposit growth and an 8% increase in noninterest income. 
Standouts for the quarter include a record level of investment banking and debt placement fees along with double-digit growth in cards and payments income. Expenses continue to be well managed and reflected higher performance-based compensation this quarter along with an increased FDIC assessments. Not on this slide but worth noting, we had another solid quarter in terms of credit quality with our net charge-off ratio remaining below our targeted range. And although this slide focuses on the stand-alone results, the performance of First Niagara since our acquisition announcement has exceeded our initial projection, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to grow this new part of our company. 
Moving now to Slide 5. As I've said, this has been a pivotal time for our company and I'm extremely proud of the dedication and hard work of our teams from both Key and First Niagara. During the last 3 months, we completed our regulatory approval process and closed our acquisition. We also completed the divestiture of 18 branches on September 9, and we executed our client outreach plan which were comprehensive in scale and scope. We mailed out 4 million pieces of mail to our new customers and our bankers have personally touched tens of thousands of clients in every business to welcome them to the new Key bank. 
I am now on Slide 6. Over Columbus Day weekend, we completed the branch and conversion which included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients onto the Key platform. We converted over 300 branches which reopened at Key and consolidated 70 former First Niagara branches, and additional Key branches are targeted for consolidated for the fourth quarter. The conversion went well. Our detailed plans were well executed and we were open for business across our franchise as planned, on Tuesday morning. Our 3 million customers, including  the 1 million from First Niagara to bank with Key throughout our 1,300 branches, 1,500 ATMs and across our digital channels from consumer online banking to our sophisticated treasury management portal. For our new customers, the systems converted as planned, their account information was transferred and products and services like credit card, debit cards and bill pay capabilities all remain fully functional. During the conversion, as issues surfaced that impacted a very small percentage of our client base, our teams worked hard to quickly resolve them and make it right for our customers. Our planning and hard work over the past 12 months paid off and execution was solid.  Although we are still in early stages, the overall feedback from legacy First Niagara customers have been positive. 
Turning to Slide 7. As I said, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our financial target. More specifically, I want to affirm our prior commitment that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our cost savings target of $400 million. As I've said before, our internal target is higher and has remained consistent. We expect to achieve our full run rate savings by the back half of 2017, which means that will be fully reflected in our 2018 results. 
Most of the outsourced technology and operation, which are a significant part of the overall cost savings should be terminated by early next year with associated savings realized by that time. Benefits from occupancy, the remaining 36 branch consolidation and corporate function will be realized throughout 2017. As we look forward, we continue to believe that Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination that accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved, improving our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points. And not included in our target but something that continues to provide real opportunity is the $300 million in revenue synergies that we have identified. But leveraging our products and capabilities in areas like payment, treasury management and commercial mortgage banking, we have the opportunity to better serve First Niagara's client base, and we've already seen some early wins and are confident that continues to grow in achieving our revenue plan. That will conclude my remarks by recognizing the hard work and dedication of our teams over the past year. I'm incredibly proud that we were able to successfully close and integrate our acquisition while at the same time, accelerate our momentum and team reflected in our Community Bank and Corporate Bank performed. And as we move forward as 1 company, I'm even more excited for the opportunity. We have to accelerates our performance, drive growth and create long-term value for our clients, community, employees and most importantly, our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Don to drive more detail on our quarterly results. Don?"

Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.30 per common share after excluding $0.14 of merger-related charges. This compared to $0.26 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the second quarter, which excluded $0.04 of merger-related charges. As Beth mentioned, after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger charges, we generated positive operating leverages relative to the year-ago quarter. On a stand-alone basis, Key revenue were up 6% from the prior year and up 5% [ph] from the second quarter. The EPS impact of First Niagara was relatively neutral to our third quarter results. Results not only reflect the impact of First Niagara's operations 2 months, but also the accounting adjustments and the impact from divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. I'll cover many of these atoms in this slide the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to Slide 10. 
Average loan balances were up $18 billion or 31% compared to a year ago quarter and up $17 billion or 27% compared from the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $15 billion of loans for the third quarter results on an average basis or $23 billion on a period end basis. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average loans grew 5% year-over-year driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans up 11%. We've seen double-digit year-over-year growth and 18 [ph] over the past 20 quarters for CF&A loans, reflecting our investment from senior banks, and we've also maintained our moderate risk profile. 
Average loans were up $1 billion or 2% on annualized from the second quarter excluding the impact of First Niagara, driven primarily from growth in commercial loan. Our estimated fair value adjustments on acquired First Niagara loans was 2.8% or $686 million. Importantly, this adjustment is an estimate and we expect additional refinement in the fourth quarter of this year as we work to finalize our purchase accounting. Also during the quarter, our branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $439 million in loans. 
Continuing on to Slide 11. Average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled $95 billion for the third quarter 2016, an increase of $25 billion compared to the year-ago period, and $21 billion compared to the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $19 billion of deposits to the third quarter results on an average basis or a $27 million on a period end basis. In our appendix materials, you will see that we recorded an estimated $356 million of core deposit and tangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
Excluding First Niagara, the I% year-over-year increase in deposit balances primary reflects core growth in our retail banking franchise and higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the second quarter 2016, our average deposits growth of 3% excluding First Niagara reflects higher escrow balances from our commercial mortgage servicing business, core deposit growth and retail banking franchise and inflows from our commercial clients. 
During the quarter, the branch divestiture resulted in a reduction $1.6 billion in deposits. 
Slide 12 shows our investment portfolio and the highlights changes that occurred over the quarter. Average total investment securities were $24 billion for the third quarter, which is up $5 billion from both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Growth compared to the prior year in the prior quarter reflects the acquisition of First Niagara's portfolio, which added $4.7 billion on average fifth [ph] balance basis and $9 billion on a period end basis. During the quarter, we completed planned sales and the repositioning of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with KEy's portfolio and investment philosophy. Proceeds of the portfolio sales are primarily used to pay down FHLB advances. 
The average yield on our investment portfolio decreased 13 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter which reflect\s the impact of First Niagara portfolio and the continued pressure from lower reinvestment yields. 
Turning to Slide 13.  Taxable equivalent net interest income of $788 million for the third quarter 2016. The net interest margin was 2.85%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. First Niagara contributed $175 million for the third quarter net interest income. Included in this figure is $19 million from purchase accounting accretion. The purchase accounting accretion on the loans in the third quarter was estimated which is not reflecting any loan payment. In the fourth quarter, we will finalize purchase accounting marks which we expect will result in increase in net interest income. 
Reported results for the quarter also includes $6 million of merger-related charges. Excluding First Niagara and the merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter, with both increases driven primarily by higher earning asset balances. 
The third quarter net interest margin up 2.85% was 9 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Purchase accounting contributed 6 basis points of the growth with all other items providing the benefit of 3 basis points on a combined basis. 
Slide 14 shows a summary of noninterest income which accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the third quarter was $549 million, up $79 million or 17% from the prior year, and up $76 million or 16% from the prior quarter. Our results this quarter included $53 million from First Niagara, which reflected 2 months worth of impact. Additionally within noninterest income, we incurred $12 million of merger-related charges, including  losses realized from repositioning of the investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and merger-related charges, noninterest income was up 8% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. We saw a continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've been, we have made over the past few years. As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees at a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, and including  commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets and M&A advisory fees, reflecting the strength of the Key relationship model. And while not a material growth driver, trading income did increase but included elsewhere in the income statement. 
Charge and payment income also contributed to our strong results are double-digit growth, excluding the impact of the acquisition compared to both the year-ago and prior quarters. In service charges on deposit accounts continue to move higher as our number of customers and related activities grow. 
During the third quarter, operating lease income and other leasing gains reflecting $12 million of lease residual losses. 
And turning to Slide 15. As you can see on this slide, reported noninterest expense of $1.1 billion includes $189 million of merger charges and $140 million of expense related to 2 months of First Niagara operation. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $753 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed breakdown of our merger-related charges i of the apprentice of our materials. Compared to the third quarter of last year and after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, noninterest expense was up $29 million or 4%. Linked quarter expenses also adjusted for the acquisition were up $47 million or 7%. Both comparisons reflect higher performance-based compensation and an increased FDIC assessment. 
Expenses related to the First Niagara operations were lower than previous guidance provided. This improvement reflects some acceleration and merger cost savings and lower-than-expected core deposit intangible amortization. 
Turning to Slide 16. Overall net charge-offs of $44 million or 23 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter which continues to be below our targeted range. Third quarter provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $14 million from the year-ago period and $7 million from the linked-quarter. Impact from First Niagara resulted in an $18 million of provision expense for the third quarter, $12 million of which related to the purchase credit card portfolio, which was initially recorded at a premium.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to year-ago period in the prior quarter, reflecting $150 million of nonperforming loans and $167 million of nonperforming assets from the First Niagara acquisition. At September 30, 2016, our total reserves for loan losses represented a 1.01% of period end loan, and 120% coverage of our nonperforming loans, and reflects the acquisition of First Niagara loans at fair value. 
And turning to Slide 17, our Common Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 9.55% which reflects the impact of First Niagara. With the completion of the acquisition, we did resume our common share repurchase program, and we repurchased $65 million in common shares during the quarter. This linked capital management will remain a priority for us. 
Moving on to Slide 18. This quarter, we have provided you with our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter on a combined company basis. Importantly, our 2016 full year outlook for stand-alone Key remains consistent with what we have provided earlier in the year. We expect average loans to benefit from a full quarter impact of First Niagara and continued core portfolio loan growth driven by strength in our commercial businesses. 
Net interest income is also expected to benefit from one additional month of the impact of First Niagara, along with normal growth in NII. Further, as we noted earlier, we anticipate of having an adjustment to purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter resulting in an increase to net income. Noninterest income will also reflect Q additional month benefit from the acquisition, and we expect the investment banking and debt placement fees for the full year of 2016 to be equal to or slightly higher than our full year 2015 results. 
In addition to a full quarter impact of noninterest expense from First Niagara, we're also anticipating a limited merger-related charges to continue in the fourth quarter. To date, we've recognized about half of our expected $550 million in merger charges. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable with our  third quarter reported results and below our targeted range of 40 to 50 [ph] basis points. Provision is to expected to be -- to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs. 
As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we have laid out for the acquisition. We continue to expect to exceed our $400 million of cost savings targets by the back half of 2017, which would then be reflected in our full year 2018 run rate. With the conversion complete, we expect to show meaningful progress towards cost savings targets as well as savings from consolidated branches, third-party and technology cost and redundancies across the franchise. With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

And so I would say that in the current run rate, we were already reflecting about $100 million of that $400 million targeted level. As we have said before that the fourth quarter won't show a meaningful increase as far as the level of cost saves, we would expect to see many of those occur in the first half of next year, with the realization of the systems conversion, the branch consolidations [indiscernible] will occur in the fourth quarter and some of the other steps we start to realize in the first half of next year. And so I would say by the end of the first half, we would be well past the 50% of attainment of that value from the cost savings."

And as far as the accounting treatment, we took a look at the $23 billion portfolio, and divided it into 2 primary pieces; one is purchase credit impaired which is just shy of $1 billion, and the other piece is the nonpurchase credit impaired. So the purchase credit impaired $1 billion, they're primarily commercial loans, and those are loans where we don't think that people will be able to live up to the commitments required and the loan agreements and they're included in that category and their marked net of reserves and net of interest rate mark. And so they don't bring over any allowance associated with that and that interest rate mark will be accretive back in the income over time. Because they are recognized as purchase credit impaired, they're excluded from the nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans. Now the rest of the $22 billion in loan portfolio, we did also record a mark on that portfolio, and it includes both credit and interest rates. We did not have any additional allows related to that. But since it's not purchase credit impaired, we did carry over the status as far as the nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. And so that's why we show $150 million coming over in NPLs from the First Niagara acquisition because many of those loans included in that nonpurchase credit impaired are reviewed on a portfolio basis as opposed to an individual loan bases.

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. 
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I'm now turning to Slide 3. Third quarter was pivotal for our company, in terms of both financial results and executing our strategy. We successfully closed our acquisition of First Niagara, adding over $35 billion in assets, 300 new branches, and $1 million new customers to Key. And while a lot of time and resources have been devoted to making sure our acquisition and conversion went smoothly, we've also stayed focused on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses. Importantly, both our community bank and corporate bank delivered strong results this quarter. And Don will cover our outlook in his remarks, but let me just say, we remain confident in meeting our commitments, including the achieving of financial targets for our acquisition.
I am now moving to Slide 4. Before I provide highlights of our quarter, I do want to share that throughout our presentation, we have provided important details and transparency for Key's stand-alone operations and the impact of our acquisition. As we move forward, we will be reporting consolidated results, with Key and First Niagara combined. But this quarter, we thought it would be useful to provide additional detail. Slide 4 provides some highlights for stand-alone Key and the strong performance we saw this quarter. Our community bank and corporate bank are performing well, and we are realizing benefit from the investments we have made in recent years. As shown in our recent earnings release, we reported EPS of $0.16, and it is $0.30, excluding the impact of merger-related charges. First Niagara operations were relatively neutral to our EPS this quarter.
Compared to the year-ago period, stand-alone Key delivered positive operating leverage. And we are well-positioned as we move forward as a combined company, having generated positive operating leverage for 9 of the past 11 quarters on a stand-alone basis. Revenue grew 6% from the prior year, as we benefited from another quarter of solid loans and deposit growth and an 8% increase in noninterest income.
Standouts for the quarter include a record level of investment banking and debt placement fees, along with double-digit growth in cards and payments income. Expenses continue to be well managed and reflected higher performance-based compensation this quarter along with an increased FDIC assessment. Not on this slide, but worth noting, we had another solid quarter in terms of credit quality with our net charge-off ratio remaining below our targeted range. And although this slide focuses on Key's stand-alone results, the performance of First Niagara, since our acquisition announcement, has exceeded our initial projection, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to grow this new part of our company.
Moving now to Slide 5. As I said, this has been a pivotal time for our company, and I'm extremely proud of the dedication and hard work of our teams from both Key and First Niagara. During the last 3 months, we completed our regulatory approval process and closed our acquisition. We also completed the divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. And we executed our client outreach plans, which were comprehensive in scale and scope. We mailed out 4 million pieces of mail to our new customers and our bankers have personally touched tens of thousands of clients in every business to welcome them to the new Key bank. 
I am now on Slide 6. Over Columbus Day weekend, we completed the branch and client conversion, which included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients onto the Key platform. We converted over 300 branches, which reopened as Key, and consolidated 70 former First Niagara branches, and additional 36 Key branches are targeted for consolidated in the fourth quarter. The conversion went well. Our detailed plans were well executed, and we were open for business across our franchise as planned, on Tuesday morning. Our 3 million customers, including  the 1 million from First Niagara, could bank with Key throughout our 1,300 branches, 1,500 ATMs and across our digital channels from consumer online banking to our sophisticated treasury management portal. For our new customers, the systems converted as planned, their account information was transferred and products and services like credit card, debit cards and bill pay capabilities all remained fully functional. During the conversion, as issues surfaced that impacted a very small percentage of our client base, our teams worked hard to quickly resolve them and make it right for our customers. Our planning and hard work over the past 12 months paid off and execution was solid. Although we are still in early stages, the overall feedback from legacy First Niagara customers has been positive.
Turning to Slide 7. As I said, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our financial target. More specifically, I want to affirm our prior commitment that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our cost savings target of $400 million. As I've said before, our internal target is higher and has remained consistent. We expect to achieve our full run rate savings by the back half of 2017, which means that it'll be fully reflected in our 2018 results.
Most of the outsourced technology and operations, which are a significant part of the overall cost savings, should be terminated by early next year with associated savings realized by that time. Benefits from occupancy, the remaining 36 branch consolidations and corporate function will be realized throughout 2017. As we look forward, we continue to believe that Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination that accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved, improving our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points. And not included in our target, but something that continues to provide real opportunity, is the $300 million in revenue synergies that we have identified. By leveraging our products and capabilities in areas like payment, treasury management and commercial mortgage banking, we have the opportunity to better serve First Niagara's client base, and we've already seen some early wins and are confident it continues to grow in achieving our revenue plans. 
Let me conclude my remarks by recognizing the hard work and dedication of our teams over the past year. I'm incredibly proud that we were able to successfully close and integrate our acquisition, while at the same time, accelerate our momentum that has been reflected in our community bank and corporate bank performance. And as we move forward as 1 company, I'm even more excited for the opportunity, we have to accelerates our performance, drive growth and create long-term value for our clients, communities, employees and most importantly, our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Don to provide more detail on our quarterly results. Don?"

Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.30 per common share after excluding $0.14 of merger-related charges. This compares to $0.26 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the second quarter, which excluded $0.04 of merger-related charges. As Beth mentioned, after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger charges, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. On a stand-alone basis, Key's revenues were up 6% from the prior year and up 5% from the second quarter. The EPS impact of First Niagara was relatively neutral to our third quarter results. Results not only reflect the impact of First Niagara's operations for 2 months, but also the estimated purchase accounting adjustments and the impact from our divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. I'll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. So I'm now turning to Slide 10.
Average loan balances were up $18 billion or 31% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $17 billion or 27% compared from the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $15 billion of loans for the third quarter results on an average basis or $23 billion on a period end basis. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average loans grew 5% year-over-year, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans up 11%. We've seen double-digit year-over-year growth in 18 of the past 20 quarters for CF&A loans, reflecting our investments in senior banks, and we've also maintained our moderate risk profile.
Average loans were up $1 billion or 2% on annualized from the second quarter, excluding the impact of First Niagara, driven primarily by growth in commercial loans. Our estimated fair value adjustments on acquired First Niagara loans was 2.8% or $686 million. Importantly, this adjustment is an estimate, and we expect to see additional refinement in the fourth quarter of this year as we work to finalize our purchase accounting. Also during the quarter, our branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $439 million in loans.
Continuing on to Slide 11. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $95 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $25 billion compared to the year-ago period and $21 billion compared to the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $19 billion of deposits to the third quarter results on an average basis or $27 million on a period end basis. In our appendix materials, you will see that we recorded an estimated $356 million of core deposit in tangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
Excluding First Niagara, the 9% year-over-year increase in deposit balances primary reflects core growth in our retail banking franchise and higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, our average deposit growth of 3%, excluding First Niagara, reflects higher escrow balances from our commercial mortgage servicing business, core deposit growth and retail banking franchise and inflows from our commercial clients. During the quarter, the branch divestiture resulted in a reduction $1.6 billion in deposits.
Slide 12 shows our investment portfolio and highlights changes that occurred over the quarter. Average total investment securities were $24 billion for the third quarter, which was up $5 billion from both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Growth compared to the prior year in the prior quarter reflects the acquisition of First Niagara's portfolio, which added $4.7 billion on an average balance basis and $9 billion on a period end basis. During the quarter, we completed planned sales and the repositioning of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with Key's portfolio and investment philosophy. Proceeds from the portfolio sales were primarily used to pay down FHLB advances.
The average yield on our investment portfolio decreased 13 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter, which reflects the impact of First Niagara portfolio and the continued pressure from lower reinvestment yields.
Turning to Slide 13. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 2.85%. These results compare to a taxable-equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. First Niagara contributed to $175 million to third quarter net interest income. Included in this figure is $19 million from purchase accounting accretion. The purchase accounting accretion on the loans for the third quarter was estimated, which does not reflect any loan prepayment. In the fourth quarter, we will finalize the purchase accounting marks, which we expect will result in an increase in net interest income.
Reported results for the quarter also include $6 million of merger-related charges. Excluding First Niagara and the merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter, with both increases driven primarily by higher earning asset balances. The third quarter net interest margin up 2.85% was 9 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Purchase accounting contributed to 6 basis points of the growth, with all other items providing a benefit of 3 basis points on a combined basis. 
Slide 14 shows a summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the third quarter was $549 million, up $79 million or 17% from the prior year and up $76 million or 16% from the prior quarter. Our results this quarter included $53 million from First Niagara, which reflected 2 months worth of impact. Additionally within noninterest income, we incurred $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses realized from repositioning of the investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and merger-related charges, noninterest income was up 8% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. We saw a continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've been -- we have made over the past few years. As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees had a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, including commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets and M&A advisory fees, reflecting the strength of the Key relationship model. And while not a material growth driver, trading income did increase, but is included elsewhere on the income statement.
Cards and payments income also contributed to our strong results with double-digit growth, excluding the impact of the acquisition compared to both the year-ago and prior quarters. And service charges on deposit accounts continued to move higher, as our number of customers and related activities grow.
During the third quarter, operating lease income and other leasing gains reflected $12 million of lease residual losses.
Turning to Slide 15. As you can see on this slide, reported noninterest expense of $1.1 billion includes $189 million of merger charges and $140 million of expense related to 2 months of First Niagara operations. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $753 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed breakout of our merger-related charges in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the third quarter of last year, and after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, noninterest expense was up $29 million or 4%. Linked-quarter expenses also adjusted for the acquisition were up $47 million or 7%. Both comparisons reflect higher performance-based compensation and an increased FDIC assessment.
Expenses related to the First Niagara operations were lower than previous guidance provided. This improvement reflects some acceleration of merger cost savings and lower-than-expected core deposits in tangible amortization.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall net charge-offs were $44 million or 23 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Third quarter provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $14 million from the year-ago period and $7 million from the linked-quarter. Impact from First Niagara resulted in an $18 million of provision expense for the third quarter, $12 million of which related to the purchase credit card portfolio, which was initially recorded at a premium.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to year-ago period in the prior quarter, reflecting $150 million of nonperforming loans and $167 million of nonperforming assets from the First Niagara acquisition. At September 30, 2016, our total reserves for loan losses represent a 1.01% of period end loans, and 120% coverage of our nonperforming loans, and reflects the acquisition of First Niagara portfolios at fair value.
And turning to Slide 17. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 9.55%, which reflects the impact of First Niagara. With the completion of the acquisition, we did resume our common share repurchase program and repurchased $65 million in common shares during the quarter. Disciplined capital management will remain a priority for us.
Moving on to Slide 18. This quarter, we have provided you with our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter on a combined company basis. Importantly, our 2016 full year outlook for stand-alone Key remains consistent with what we've provided earlier in the year. We expect average loans to benefit from a full quarter impact of First Niagara, and continued core portfolio loan growth driven by strength in our commercial businesses. 
Net interest income is also expected to benefit from 1 additional month of the impact of First Niagara along with normal growth in NII. Further, as we noted earlier, we anticipate having an adjustment to purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter resulting in an increase to net interest income. Noninterest income will also reflect 1 additional month benefit from the acquisition, and we expect investment banking and debt placement fees for the full year of 2016 to be equal to or slightly higher than our full year 2015 results.
In addition to a full quarter impact of noninterest expense from First Niagara, we're also anticipating elevated merger-related charges to continue in the fourth quarter. To date, we've recognized about half of our expected $550 million in merger charges. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable with our third quarter reported results and below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Provision is expected to be -- to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs.
As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we've laid out for the acquisition. We continue to expect to exceed our $400 million of cost savings targets by the back half of 2017, which would then be reflected in our full year 2018 run rate. With the conversion complete, we expect to show meaningful progress toward our cost savings target as we realize savings from the consolidated branches, third-party and technology costs and redundancies across the franchise. With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

And so I would say that in the current run rate, we were already reflecting about $100 million of that $400 million targeted level. As we've said before that the fourth quarter won't show a meaningful increase as far as the level of cost saves. We would expect to see many of those occur in the first half of next year, with the realization of the systems conversions, the branch consolidations that remain, which will occur here in the fourth quarter, and some of the other steps that will start to be realized in the first half of next year. And so I would say by the end of the first half, we would be well past the 50% of attainment of that value from the cost savings."

What's unique about those credit card portfolios is that we recorded at our premium, and so the value of that portfolio was higher than par.

For the purchase credit impaired $1 billion portfolio, they're primarily commercial loans, and those are loans where we don't think they're going to be able to live up to the commitments required in the loan agreements and they're included in that category and their marked net of reserves and net of interest rate mark. And so they don't bring over any allowance associated with that and that interest rate mark will be accretive back into income over time. Because they are recognized as purchase credit impaired, they're excluded from the nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans. Now the rest of the $22 billion in loan portfolio, we did also record a mark on that portfolio, and it includes both credit and interest rates. We did not have any additional allowance related to that. But since it's not purchase credit impaired, we did carry over the status as far as the nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. And so that's why we show $150 million coming over in NPLs from the First Niagara acquisition because many of those loans included in that nonpurchase credit impaired are reviewed on a portfolio basis as opposed to an individual loan basis.

Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call. I'm now turning to Slide 3. Third quarter was pivotal for our company, in terms of both financial results and executing our strategy. We successfully closed our acquisition of First Niagara, adding over $35 billion in assets, 300 new branches, and $1 million new customers to Key. And while a lot of time and resources have been devoted to making sure our acquisition and conversion went smoothly, we've also stayed focused on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses. Importantly, both our community bank and corporate bank delivered strong results this quarter. And Don will cover our outlook in his remarks, but let me just say, we remain confident in meeting our commitments, including the achieving of financial targets for our acquisition.
I am now moving to Slide 4. Before I provide highlights of our quarter, I do want to share that throughout our presentation, we have provided important details and transparency for Key's stand-alone operations and the impact of our acquisition. As we move forward, we will be reporting consolidated results, with Key and First Niagara combined. But this quarter, we thought it would be useful to provide additional detail. Slide 4 provides some highlights for stand-alone Key and the strong performance we saw this quarter. Our community bank and corporate bank are performing well, and we are realizing benefit from the investments we have made in recent years. As shown in our recent earnings release, we reported EPS of $0.16, and it is $0.30, excluding the impact of merger-related charges. First Niagara operations were relatively neutral to our EPS this quarter.
Compared to the year-ago period, stand-alone Key delivered positive operating leverage. And we are well-positioned as we move forward as a combined company, having generated positive operating leverage for 9 of the past 11 quarters on a stand-alone basis. Revenue grew 6% from the prior year, as we benefited from another quarter of solid loans and deposit growth and an 8% increase in noninterest income.
Standouts for the quarter include a record level of investment banking and debt placement fees, along with double-digit growth in cards and payments income. Expenses continue to be well managed and reflected higher performance-based compensation this quarter along with an increased FDIC assessment. Not on this slide, but worth noting, we had another solid quarter in terms of credit quality with our net charge-off ratio remaining below our targeted range. And although this slide focuses on Key's stand-alone results, the performance of First Niagara, since our acquisition announcement, has exceeded our initial projection, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to grow this new part of our company.
Moving now to Slide 5. As I said, this has been a pivotal time for our company, and I'm extremely proud of the dedication and hard work of our teams from both Key and First Niagara. During the last 3 months, we completed our regulatory approval process and closed our acquisition. We also completed the divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. And we executed our client outreach plans, which were comprehensive in scale and scope. We mailed out 4 million pieces of mail to our new customers and our bankers have personally touched tens of thousands of clients in every business to welcome them to the new Key bank. 
I am now on Slide 6. Over Columbus Day weekend, we completed the branch and client conversion, which included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients onto the Key platform. We converted over 300 branches, which reopened as Key, and consolidated 70 former First Niagara branches, and additional 36 Key branches are targeted for consolidation in the fourth quarter. The conversion went well. Our detailed plans were well executed, and we were open for business across our franchise as planned, on Tuesday morning. Our 3 million customers, including  the 1 million from First Niagara, could bank with Key throughout our 1,300 branches, 1,500 ATMs and across our digital channels from consumer online banking to our sophisticated treasury management portal. For our new customers, the systems converted as planned, their account information was transferred and products and services like credit card, debit cards and bill pay capabilities all remained fully functional. During the conversion, as issues surfaced that impacted a very small percentage of our client base, our teams worked hard to quickly resolve them and make it right for our customers. Our planning and hard work over the past 12 months paid off and execution was solid. Although we are still in early stages, the overall feedback from legacy First Niagara customers has been positive.
Turning to Slide 7. As I said, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets. More specifically, I want to affirm our prior commitment that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our cost savings target of $400 million. As I've said before, our internal target is higher and has remained consistent. We expect to achieve our full run rate savings by the back half of 2017, which means that it will be fully reflected in our 2018 results.
Most of the outsourced technology and operations, which are a significant part of the overall cost savings, should be terminated by early next year with associated savings realized by that time. Benefits from occupancy, the remaining 36 branch consolidations and corporate function will be realized throughout 2017. As we look forward, we continue to believe that Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination that accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved, improving our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points. And not included in our target, but something that continues to provide real opportunity, is the $300 million in revenue synergies that we have identified. By leveraging our products and capabilities in areas like payments, treasury management and commercial mortgage banking, we have the opportunity to better serve First Niagara's client base, and we've already seen some early wins and are confidence continues to grow in achieving our revenue plans. 
Let me conclude my remarks by recognizing the hard work and dedication of our teams over the past year. I'm incredibly proud that we were able to successfully close and integrate our acquisition, while at the same time, accelerate our momentum that has been reflected in our community bank and corporate bank performance. And as we move forward as 1 company, I'm even more excited for the opportunities we have to accelerates our performance, drive growth and create long-term value for our clients, communities, employees and most importantly, our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Don to provide more detail on our quarterly results. Don?"

Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.30 per common share after excluding $0.14 of merger-related charges. This compares to $0.26 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the second quarter, which excluded $0.04 of merger-related charges. As Beth mentioned, after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger charges, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. On a stand-alone basis, Key's revenues were up 6% from the prior year and up 5% from the second quarter. The EPS impact of First Niagara was relatively neutral to our third quarter results. Results not only reflect the impact of First Niagara's operations for 2 months, but also the estimated purchase accounting adjustments and the impact from our divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. I'll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. So I'm now turning to Slide 10.
Average loan balances were up $18 billion or 31% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $17 billion or 27% compared from the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $15 billion of loans for the third quarter results on an average basis or $23 billion on a period end basis. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average loans grew 5% year-over-year, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans up 11%. We've seen double-digit year-over-year growth in 18 of the past 20 quarters for CF&A loans, reflecting our investments in senior banks, and we've also maintained our moderate risk profile.
Average loans were up $1 billion or 2% on annualized from the second quarter, excluding the impact of First Niagara, driven primarily by growth in commercial loans. Our estimated fair value adjustment on acquired First Niagara loans was 2.8% or $686 million. Importantly, this adjustment is an estimate, and we expect to see additional refinement in the fourth quarter of this year as we work to finalize our purchase accounting. Also during the quarter, our branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $439 million in loans.
Continuing on to Slide 11. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $95 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $25 billion compared to the year-ago period and $21 billion compared to the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $19 billion of deposits to the third quarter results on an average basis or $27 billion on a period end basis. In our appendix materials, you will see that we recorded an estimated $356 million of core deposit in tangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
Excluding First Niagara, the 9% year-over-year increase in deposit balances primary reflects core growth in our retail banking franchise and higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, our average deposit growth of 3%, excluding First Niagara, reflects higher escrow balances from our commercial mortgage servicing business, core deposit growth and retail banking franchise and inflows from our commercial clients. During the quarter, the branch divestiture resulted in a reduction $1.6 billion in deposits.
Slide 12 shows our investment portfolio and highlights changes that occurred over the quarter. Average total investment securities were $24 billion for the third quarter, which was up $5 billion from both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Growth compared to the prior year in the prior quarter reflects the acquisition of First Niagara's portfolio, which added $4.7 billion on an average balance basis and $9 billion on a period end basis. During the quarter, we completed planned sales and the repositioned of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with Key's portfolio and investment philosophy. Proceeds from the portfolio sales were primarily used to pay down FHLB advances.
The average yield on our investment portfolio decreased 13 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter, which reflects the impact of First Niagara portfolio and the continued pressure from lower reinvestment yields.
Turning to Slide 13. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 2.85%. These results compare to a taxable-equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. First Niagara contributed to $175 million to third quarter net interest income. Included in this figure is $19 million from purchase accounting accretion. The purchase accounting accretion on the loans for the third quarter was estimated, which does not reflect any loan prepayment. In the fourth quarter, we will finalize the purchase accounting marks, which we expect will result in an increase in net interest income.
Reported results for the quarter also include $6 million of merger-related charges. Excluding First Niagara and the merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter, with both increases driven primarily by higher earning asset balances. The third quarter net interest margin of 2.85% was 9 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Purchase accounting contributed to 6 basis points of the growth, with all other items providing a benefit of 3 basis points on a combined basis. 
Slide 14 shows a summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the third quarter was $549 million, up $79 million or 17% from the prior year and up $76 million or 16% from the prior quarter. Our results this quarter included $53 million from First Niagara, which reflected 2 months worth of impact. Additionally within noninterest income, we incurred $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses realized from repositioning of the investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and merger-related charges, noninterest income was up 8% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've been -- we have made over the past few years. As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees had a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, including commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets and M&A advisory fees, reflecting the strength of the Key relationship model. And while not a material growth driver, trading income did increase, but is included elsewhere on the income statement.
Cards and payments income also contributed to our strong results with double-digit growth, excluding the impact of the acquisition compared to both the year-ago and prior quarters. And service charges on deposit accounts continued to move higher, as our number of customers and related activities grow.
During the third quarter, operating lease income and other leasing gains reflected $12 million of lease residual losses.
Turning to Slide 15. As you can see on this slide, reported noninterest expense of $1.1 billion includes $189 million of merger charges and $140 million of expense related to 2 months of First Niagara operations. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $753 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed breakout of our merger-related charges in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the third quarter of last year, and after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, noninterest expense was up $29 million or 4%. Linked-quarter expenses also adjusted for the acquisition were up $47 million or 7%. Both comparisons reflect higher performance-based compensation and an increased FDIC assessment.
Expenses related to the First Niagara operations were lower than previous guidance provided. This improvement reflects some acceleration of merger cost savings and lower-than-expected core deposits in tangible amortization.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall net charge-offs were $44 million or 23 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Third quarter provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $14 million from the year-ago period and $7 million from the linked-quarter. Impact from First Niagara resulted in an $18 million of provision expense for the third quarter, $12 million of which related to the purchase credit card portfolio, which was initially recorded at a premium.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to year-ago period in the prior quarter, reflecting $150 million of nonperforming loans and $167 million of nonperforming assets from the First Niagara acquisition. At September 30, 2016, our total reserves for loan losses represent a 1.01% of period end loans, and 120% coverage of our nonperforming loans, and reflects the acquisition of First Niagara portfolios at fair value.
And turning to Slide 17. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 9.55%, which reflects the impact of First Niagara. With the completion of the acquisition, we did resume our common share repurchase program and repurchased $65 million in common shares during the quarter. Disciplined capital management will remain a priority for us.
Moving on to Slide 18. This quarter, we have provided you with our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter on a combined company basis. Importantly, our 2016 full year outlook for stand-alone Key remains consistent with what we've provided earlier in the year. We expect average loans to benefit from a full quarter impact of First Niagara, and continued core portfolio loan growth driven by strength in our commercial businesses. 
Net interest income is also expected to benefit from 1 additional month of the impact of First Niagara along with normal growth in NII. Further, as we noted earlier, we anticipate having an adjustment to purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter resulting in an increase to net interest income. Noninterest income will also reflect 1 additional month benefit from the acquisition, and we expect investment banking and debt placement fees for the full year of 2016 to be equal to or slightly higher than our full year 2015 results.
In addition to a full quarter impact of noninterest expense from First Niagara, we're also anticipating elevated merger-related charges to continue in the fourth quarter. To date, we've recognized about half of our expected $550 million in merger charges. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable with our third quarter reported results and below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Provision is expected to be -- to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs.
As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we've laid out for the acquisition. We continue to expect to exceed our $400 million of cost savings targets by the back half of 2017, which would then be reflected in our full year 2018 run rate. With the conversion complete, we expect to show meaningful progress toward our cost savings target as we realize savings from the consolidated branches, third-party and technology costs and redundancies across the franchise. With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

I would start off by saying that if you take a look at the run rate of expenses for First Niagara that's included in our third quarter results, it shows an average monthly run rate of about $70 million a month. That compares with the run rate before acquisition of over $80 million. And so I would say that in the current run rate, we were already reflecting about $100 million of that $400 million targeted level. As we've said before that the fourth quarter won't show a meaningful increase as far as the level of cost saves. We would expect to see many of those occur in the first half of next year, with the realization of the systems conversions, the branch consolidations that remain, which will occur here in the fourth quarter, and some of the other steps that will start to be realized in the first half of next year. And so I would say by the end of the first half, we would be well past the 50% of attainment of that value from the cost savings."

If you look at the growth of the experience from the time of acquisition to the time of closing, it was in excess of what we would have expected. They showed growth in customers, in households, they've showed growth in deposit balances and loan balances. And so they were able to continue to grow that franchise, despite the fact that this merger was going on. And then, you combine that with the expense saves that we realized here in the third quarter, that would have been earlier than what we would have expected as well. And so it feels like and it shows that they're exceeding in all fronts."

We've had some early comments about the low tax rate for the quarter. And if you take a look at our reported earnings and backout the related merger charges and assume a 35% tax rate on those merger charges, the effective tax rate for the current quarter was 22.4% for core operations. On a year-to-date basis, that's 24.4%. And so we benefited in the third quarter from some higher credits associated with some equipment leasing activities. We also had a slight charge in the second quarter, and so we would expect those credits to continue.

For the purchase credit impaired $1 billion portfolio, they're primarily commercial loans, and those are loans where we don't think they're going to be able to live up to the commitments required in the loan agreements and they're included in that category and their marked net of reserves and net of interest rate mark. And so they don't bring over any allowance associated with that and that interest rate mark will be accretive back into income over time. Because they are recognized as purchase credit impaired, they're excluded from the nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans. Now the rest of the $22 billion in loan portfolio, we did also record a mark on that portfolio, and it includes both credit and interest rates. We did not have any additional allowance related to that. But since it's not purchase credit impaired, we did carry over the status as far as the nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets.

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. 
Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. I'm now turning to Slide 3. Third quarter was pivotal for our company, in terms of both financial results and executing our strategy. We successfully closed our acquisition of First Niagara, adding over $35 billion in assets, 300 new branches, and $1 million new customers to Key. And while a lot of time and resources have been devoted to making sure our acquisition and conversion went smoothly, we've also stayed focused on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses. Importantly, both our community bank and corporate bank delivered strong results this quarter. And Don will cover our outlook in his remarks, but let me just say, we remain confident in meeting our commitments, including the achieving of financial targets for our acquisition.
I am now moving to Slide 4. Before I provide highlights of our quarter, I do want to share that throughout our presentation, we have provided important details and transparency for Key's stand-alone operations and the impact of our acquisition. As we move forward, we will be reporting consolidated results, with Key and First Niagara combined. But this quarter, we thought it would be useful to provide additional detail. Slide 4 provides some highlights for stand-alone Key and the strong performance we saw this quarter. Our community bank and corporate bank are performing well, and we are realizing benefit from the investments we have made in recent years. As shown in our recent earnings release, we reported EPS of $0.16, and it is $0.30, excluding the impact of merger-related charges. First Niagara operations were relatively neutral to our EPS this quarter.
Compared to the year-ago period, stand-alone Key delivered positive operating leverage. And we are well-positioned as we move forward as a combined company, having generated positive operating leverage for 9 of the past 11 quarters on a stand-alone basis. Revenue grew 6% from the prior year, as we benefited from another quarter of solid loans and deposit growth and an 8% increase in noninterest income.
Standouts for the quarter include a record level of investment banking and debt placement fees, along with double-digit growth in cards and payments income. Expenses continue to be well managed and reflected higher performance-based compensation this quarter along with an increased FDIC assessment. Not on this slide, but worth noting, we had another solid quarter in terms of credit quality with our net charge-off ratio remaining below our targeted range. And although this slide focuses on Key's stand-alone results, the performance of First Niagara, since our acquisition announcement, has exceeded our initial projection, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to grow this new part of our company.
Moving now to Slide 5. As I said, this has been a pivotal time for our company, and I'm extremely proud of the dedication and hard work of our teams from both Key and First Niagara. During the last 3 months, we completed our regulatory approval process and closed our acquisition. We also completed the divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. And we executed our client outreach plans, which were comprehensive in scale and scope. We mailed out 4 million pieces of mail to our new customers and our bankers have personally touched tens of thousands of clients in every business to welcome them to the new Key bank. 
I am now on Slide 6. Over Columbus Day weekend, we completed the branch and client conversion, which included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients onto the Key platform. We converted over 300 branches, which reopened as Key, and consolidated 70 former First Niagara branches, and additional 36 Key branches are targeted for consolidation in the fourth quarter. The conversion went well. Our detailed plans were well executed, and we were open for business across our franchise as planned, on Tuesday morning. Our 3 million customers, including the 1 million from First Niagara, could bank with Key throughout our 1,300 branches, 1,500 ATMs and across our digital channels from consumer online banking to our sophisticated treasury management portal. For our new customers, the systems converted as planned, their account information was transferred and products and services like credit card, debit cards and bill pay capabilities all remained fully functional. During the conversion, as issues surfaced that impacted a very small percentage of our client base, our teams worked hard to quickly resolve them and make it right for our customers. Our planning and hard work over the past 12 months paid off and execution was solid. Although we are still in early stages, the overall feedback from legacy First Niagara customers has been positive.
Turning to Slide 7. As I said, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets. More specifically, I want to affirm our prior commitment that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our cost savings target of $400 million. As I've said before, our internal target is higher and has remained consistent. We expect to achieve our full run rate savings by the back half of 2017, which means that it will be fully reflected in our 2018 results.
Most of the outsourced technology and operations, which are a significant part of the overall cost savings, should be terminated by early next year with associated savings realized by that time. Benefits from occupancy, the remaining 36 branch consolidations and corporate function will be realized throughout 2017. As we look forward, we continue to believe that Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination that accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved, improving our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points. And not included in our target, but something that continues to provide real opportunity, is the $300 million in revenue synergies that we have identified. By leveraging our products and capabilities in areas like payments, treasury management and commercial mortgage banking, we have the opportunity to better serve First Niagara's client base, and we've already seen some early wins and are confidence continues to grow in achieving our revenue plans. 
Let me conclude my remarks by recognizing the hard work and dedication of our teams over the past year. I'm incredibly proud that we were able to successfully close and integrate our acquisition, while at the same time, accelerate our momentum that has been reflected in our community bank and corporate bank performance. And as we move forward as 1 company, I'm even more excited for the opportunities we have to accelerates our performance, drive growth and create long-term value for our clients, communities, employees and most importantly, our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Don to provide more detail on our quarterly results. Don?"

Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.30 per common share after excluding $0.14 of merger-related charges. This compares to $0.26 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the second quarter, which excluded $0.04 of merger-related charges. As Beth mentioned, after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger charges, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. On a stand-alone basis, Key's revenues were up 6% from the prior year and up 5% from the second quarter. The EPS impact of First Niagara was relatively neutral to our third quarter results. Results not only reflect the impact of First Niagara's operations for 2 months, but also the estimated purchase accounting adjustments and the impact from our divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. I'll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. So I'm now turning to Slide 10.
Average loan balances were up $18 billion or 31% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $17 billion or 27% compared from the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $15 billion of loans for the third quarter results on an average basis or $23 billion on a period end basis. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average loans grew 5% year-over-year, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans up 11%. We've seen double-digit year-over-year growth in 18 of the past 20 quarters for CF&A loans, reflecting our investments in senior banks, and we've also maintained our moderate risk profile.
Average loans were up $1 billion or 2% on annualized from the second quarter, excluding the impact of First Niagara, driven primarily by growth in commercial loans. Our estimated fair value adjustment on acquired First Niagara loans was 2.8% or $686 million. Importantly, this adjustment is an estimate, and we expect to see additional refinement in the fourth quarter of this year as we work to finalize our purchase accounting. Also during the quarter, our branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $439 million in loans.
Continuing on to Slide 11. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $95 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $25 billion compared to the year-ago period and $21 billion compared to the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $19 billion of deposits to the third quarter results on an average basis or $27 billion on a period end basis. In our appendix materials, you will see that we recorded an estimated $356 million of core deposit in tangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
Excluding First Niagara, the 9% year-over-year increase in deposit balances primary reflects core growth in our retail banking franchise and higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, our average deposit growth of 3%, excluding First Niagara, reflects higher escrow balances from our commercial mortgage servicing business, core deposit growth and retail banking franchise and inflows from our commercial clients. During the quarter, the branch divestiture resulted in a reduction $1.6 billion in deposits.
Slide 12 shows our investment portfolio and highlights changes that occurred over the quarter. Average total investment securities were $24 billion for the third quarter, which was up $5 billion from both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Growth compared to the prior year in the prior quarter reflects the acquisition of First Niagara's portfolio, which added $4.7 billion on an average balance basis and $9 billion on a period end basis. During the quarter, we completed planned sales and the repositioned of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with Key's portfolio and investment philosophy. Proceeds from the portfolio sales were primarily used to pay down FHLB advances.
The average yield on our investment portfolio decreased 13 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter, which reflects the impact of First Niagara portfolio and the continued pressure from lower reinvestment yields.
Turning to Slide 13. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 2.85%. These results compare to a taxable-equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. First Niagara contributed to $175 million to third quarter net interest income. Included in this figure is $19 million from purchase accounting accretion. The purchase accounting accretion on the loans for the third quarter was estimated, which does not reflect any loan prepayment. In the fourth quarter, we will finalize the purchase accounting marks, which we expect will result in an increase in net interest income.
Reported results for the quarter also include $6 million of merger-related charges. Excluding First Niagara and the merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter, with both increases driven primarily by higher earning asset balances. The third quarter net interest margin of 2.85% was 9 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Purchase accounting contributed to 6 basis points of the growth, with all other items providing a benefit of 3 basis points on a combined basis. 
Slide 14 shows a summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the third quarter was $549 million, up $79 million or 17% from the prior year and up $76 million or 16% from the prior quarter. Our results this quarter included $53 million from First Niagara, which reflected 2 months’ worth of impact. Additionally within noninterest income, we incurred $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses realized from repositioning of the investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and merger-related charges, noninterest income was up 8% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've been -- we have made over the past few years. As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees had a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, including commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets and M&A advisory fees, reflecting the strength of the Key relationship model. And while not a material growth driver, trading income did increase, but is included elsewhere on the income statement.
Cards and payments income also contributed to our strong results with double-digit growth, excluding the impact of the acquisition compared to both the year-ago and prior quarters. And service charges on deposit accounts continued to move higher, as our number of customers and related activities grow.
During the third quarter, operating lease income and other leasing gains reflected $12 million of lease residual losses.
Turning to Slide 15. As you can see on this slide, reported noninterest expense of $1.1 billion includes $189 million of merger charges and $140 million of expense related to 2 months of First Niagara operations. Excluding these costs, noninterest expense was $753 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed breakout of our merger-related charges in the appendix of our materials. Compared to the third quarter of last year, and after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, noninterest expense was up $29 million or 4%. Linked-quarter expenses also adjusted for the acquisition were up $47 million or 7%. Both comparisons reflect higher performance-based compensation and an increased FDIC assessment.
Expenses related to the First Niagara operations were lower than previous guidance provided. This improvement reflects some acceleration of merger cost savings and lower-than-expected core deposits in tangible amortization.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall net charge-offs were $44 million or 23 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Third quarter provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $14 million from the year-ago period and $7 million from the linked-quarter. Impact from First Niagara resulted in an $18 million of provision expense for the third quarter, $12 million of which related to the purchase credit card portfolio, which was initially recorded at a premium.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets both increased relative to year-ago period in the prior quarter, reflecting $150 million of nonperforming loans and $167 million of nonperforming assets from the First Niagara acquisition. At September 30, 2016, our total reserves for loan losses represent a 1.01% of period end loans, and 120% coverage of our nonperforming loans, and reflects the acquisition of First Niagara portfolios at fair value.
And turning to Slide 17. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 9.55%, which reflects the impact of First Niagara. With the completion of the acquisition, we did resume our common share repurchase program and repurchased $65 million in common shares during the quarter. Disciplined capital management will remain a priority for us.
Moving on to Slide 18. This quarter, we have provided you with our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter on a combined company basis. Importantly, our 2016 full year outlook for stand-alone Key remains consistent with what we've provided earlier in the year. We expect average loans to benefit from a full quarter impact of First Niagara, and continued core portfolio loan growth driven by strength in our commercial businesses. 
Net interest income is also expected to benefit from 1 additional month of the impact of First Niagara along with normal growth in NII. Further, as we noted earlier, we anticipate having an adjustment to purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter resulting in an increase to net interest income. Noninterest income will also reflect 1 additional month benefit from the acquisition, and we expect investment banking and debt placement fees for the full year of 2016 to be equal to or slightly higher than our full year 2015 results.
In addition to a full quarter impact of noninterest expense from First Niagara, we're also anticipating elevated merger-related charges to continue in the fourth quarter. To date, we've recognized about half of our expected $550 million in merger charges. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable with our third quarter reported results and below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Provision is expected to be -- to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs.
As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we've laid out for the acquisition. We continue to expect to exceed our $400 million of cost savings targets by the back half of 2017, which would then be reflected in our full year 2018 run rate. With the conversion complete, we expect to show meaningful progress toward our cost savings target as we realize savings from the consolidated branches, third-party and technology costs and redundancies across the franchise. 
With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

That compares with the run rate before acquisition of over $80 million. And so I would say that in the current run rate, we were already reflecting about $100 million of that $400 million targeted level. As we've said before that the fourth quarter won't show a meaningful increase as far as the level of cost saves. We would expect to see many of those occur in the first half of next year, with the realization of the systems conversions, the branch consolidations that remain, which will occur here in the fourth quarter, and some of the other steps that will start to be realized in the first half of next year. And so I would say by the end of the first half, we would be well past the 50% of attainment of that value from the cost savings."

And as far as the accounting treatment, we took a look at the $23 billion portfolio, and divided it into 2 primary pieces; one is purchase credit impaired, which was just shy of $1 billion, and the other piece is the nonpurchase credit impaired. For the purchase credit impaired $1 billion portfolio, they're primarily commercial loans, and those are loans where we don't think they're going to be able to live up to the commitments required in the loan agreements and they're included in that category and their marked net of reserves and net of interest rate mark. And so they don't bring over any allowance associated with that and that interest rate mark will be accretive back into income over time. Because they are recognized as purchase credit impaired, they're excluded from the nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans. Now the rest of the $22 billion in loan portfolio, we did also record a mark on that portfolio, and it includes both credit and interest rates. We did not have any additional allowance related to that. But since it's not purchase credit impaired, we did carry over the status as far as the nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. And so that's why we show $150 million coming over in NPLs from the First Niagara acquisition because many of those loans included in that nonpurchase credit impaired are reviewed on a portfolio basis as opposed to an individual loan basis. And so on a portfolio basis, we believe that the portfolio will be able to perform in line with expectations."
