We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $187 million, ending a strong year with $2.85 billion in earnings. These results include a $370 million pretax charge to value our inventory at lower cost to market. We remained very encouraged by the environment for U.S. refiners and we're pleased to see resilient supported by attractive product price realizations and continued strong gasoline demand in the fourth quarter. We believe lower prices at the pump will remain constructive for retail demand as we move through 2016.
Crude oil prices continued to see pressure with the lifting of the Iranian sanctions, resiliency of domestic producers and sentiment in the market. Crude differentials have been and will likely remain volatile.
WTI has traded at parity, and in fact, higher than Brent recently, and we expect this trading pattern could continue in the near term. However, longer-term, we believe it will revert back to a differential based on product quality and transportation cost between the grades.
We believe more favorable sweet sour spread will continue to exist and had benefit MPC's complex refinery configuration in the Midwest and Gulf Coast.
In December, the South Texas Extension Pipeline, or SAX, came online provided increased logistics flexibility in crude optionality, allowing us to more cost-effectively move Bakken and Canadian crudes into our Midwest refineries.
SAX allows MPC to access additional advantage crudes and adjust our slate based on the best economics. Speedway continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with nearly $1 billion of EBITDA.
I want to recognize Tony Kenney and his team's efforts in completing the planned conversions of our East Coast and Southeast retail locations to the Speedway brand well ahead of schedule. The team's aggressive execution strategy facilitated the realization of these synergies from these locations much sooner than anticipated and beyond our original projections.
The acquisition of these high-quality assets has been a tremendous value driver and has exceeded our expectations in virtually every area. In addition to our strong financial and operational results in 2015, we also made tremendous progress in our strategic objectives of growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business and enhancing our refining margins. An example of enhancing our refining margins is a condensate split that came online in 2015 at our refinery, which allows the refinery to process condensate produced in the region and thus improve its realized margins. 
Completion of the MPLX and MarkWest merger in early December was a significant accomplishment in the company strategy. Through this combination, we have created a diversified, large-cap MLP that positions the partnership as a midstream leader with compelling long-term growth opportunities.
We continued to believe MPLs have create substantial value to MPC shareholders through its general partner interest and associated incentive distribution rights and we are eager to develop the numerous commercial synergies available to the combined partnership.
I would also like to comment on our long-term commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Through share buyback programs and dividends, we returned a total of $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015, included $362 million during the fourth quarter.
Delivering attractive capital returns to our shareholders continues to be an instrumental part of our strategy. To year end 2015, we have purchased over $7 billion of MPC common stock or approximately 28% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. Our approach for the allocation of capital continues to be balanced and long-term in nature, taking into consideration the requirements of the business, returns to our shareholders and our overall capital structure.
As a result, we may increase or decrease the amount of share repurchase activity in any given year based on these variables. Through disciplined strategic investments in our business, and returning capital to shareholders, we remained focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. This discipline and prudent approach carries over to our sponsorship of MPLX. As we evaluate the continued decline in commodity prices, and the market's increasing belief that these price conditions will persist for some period of time, MPLX' producer customers are directly impacted. While MPLX' producers are in some of the best areas and continues to manage their capital and production clients very carefully, changes in volume growth will continue to impact the income growth for the partnership. At the same time, valuations within the MLP space, including MPLX, had been severely impacted, resulting in yield levels that are substantially higher than what we anticipated at the time of the merger, even with the strong support we expect to continue to make available through the partnership. These factors contributed to MPLX' decision to provide new distribution growth guidance.
Current market [indiscernible] to an expected 12% to 15% distribution growth rate for 2016, revised from prior 25%. Even with this change, MPLX' distribution growth continues to be among the highest for large-cap diversified MLPs. We are asked at our Investor Day meeting that there's a tipping point as to when higher growth guidance will not make sense. I share then that if conditions did not improve in MPLX' valuation and resulting yield, we would likely revisit the growth outlook for the partnership. 
Based on the continued deterioration we have seen since then, we have reached that point and this change in distribution growth is necessary. The commodity and equity market conditions we are now experiencing could be temporary and we will assess the growth path for 2017 later this year, providing guidance around the partnership's distribution growth capabilities at that time. We will take into consideration the capital allocation of these both MPC and MPLX but expect to continue providing support to the partnership as it navigates through this challenging environment.
In support of MPLX' 2016 growth plans, MPC offered to contribute its marine Business from MPLX at what we believe will be supported value and we anticipate receiving MPLX equity in exchange for these assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending requisite approvals.
This drop-down of additional logistics assets through the partnership further diversifies its high-quality earnings stream and underscores our flexibility -- our sponsorship at MPLX.
MPC is focused on strengthening the earnings power of all aspects of its business, with the expanded margin enhancing investments across the enterprise. We recently announced plans to invest $2 billion to the Galveston Bay refinery over the next 5 years and investment program referred to as the South Texas Asset Repositioning program, or STAR. The investments planned as part of the STAR program, of which approximately $150 million will be spent in 2016, are intended to increase production of higher value products and improve the facility's reliability as well as increase processing capacity. These high return investments will fully integrate our Galveston Bay refinery with our Texas City refinery, making it the second-largest refinery in the U.S.
We expect a rapid payback on the states investment plan for the STAR program, including an earning stream in 2016. By using the flexibility inherent in our refining system and optimizing our logistics and transportation network, we are able to react quickly to changing crude oil and refined product market conditions, maximizing our profitability.
In addition, as our downstream earnings demonstrate, our business produces strong results in a wide variety of commodity price environments. We remained optimistic on the long-term prospects for our business and continued to believe returns will be compelling, including our sponsorship and GP interest in MPLX.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the fourth quarter. Tim?"

Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and tertiary basis for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2015. Earnings $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 diluted share in la",1973,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and tertiary basis for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2015. Earnings $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 diluted share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year 2015, our earnings were almost $2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share compared to 2014 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.39 per diluted share.
Chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter of 2015. As Gary mentioned, the earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $370 million accrued tax charge to adjusted inventories to market values. $345 million of this charge is included in the Refining & Marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in [indiscernible] segment.
After adjusting for the charge, earnings were down $374 million versus fourth quarter last year, largely attributable to our refining market -- Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments, partially offset by lower income taxes associated with the lower earnings. I'll talk about each of these segments and the changes compared to the prior period shortly.
Results for the quarter also included income from MarkWest since the December 4 merger date with MPLX, which is included in the renamed midstream segment, previously known as Pipeline Transportation, and we'll continue to consolidate MPLX for reporting purposes.
Turning to Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $207 million in the fourth quarter compared to just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrow crude differentials and lower dollar-based refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower refined product prices.
In addition, the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected an unfavorable LIFO accounting effect of approximately $45 million as compared to a favorable effect of approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter of last year. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $784 million other gross margin step on the slide.
In addition, segment results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the $345 million LCM charge I just mentioned, which is broken out separately here. The unfavorable impact on segment income were partially offset by higher LLS spreads in Chicago and the Gulf coast, favorable market structure and improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter, along with slightly higher sour runs.
The blended crack was 6 65 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to 5 42 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '14. You may recall the crack spreads we provided in our market metrics on our website are product and crude prices. The price we actually paid for crude on the other hand is established over the calendar month that we processed the crude, but takes no account the market structure. The contango effect is reflected $192 million favorable difference reflected as market structure on the walk and relates to this difference between the top crude prices we used for market metrics in the actual crude acquisition cost.
Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is nearly $4.2 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a $1.3 billion favorable impact on full-year earnings, the Chicago cracks, $1.11 per barrel better than '15 and Gulf Coast cracks $1.88 per barrel higher.
Based on our estimated mix of 38% Chicago and 62% Gulf Coast, which resulted in the blended crack spread of $9.70 per barrel or about $1.59 better than 2014. In addition, favorable market structure, more favorable product price realizations and lower direct operating costs driven primarily by lower turnaround activity and lower purchase energy cost, had positive impacts on earnings year-over-year. This positive impacts on earnings were partially offset by less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrow crude differentials and lower refinery volumetric gains.
In addition, the LCM and LIFO accounting impacts I described earlier also impacted 2015 full-year earnings. The impact of more favorable product price realizations, less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to market indicators, lower volumetric gains and the unfavorable LIFO impact are all reflected in the $1.5 billion of other gross margin in the graph.
Other Refining & Marketing segments net expenses increased $396 million compared to 2014 as a result of a number of items, including higher terminal and transportation cost and lower equity affiliated income.
Slide 8 shows the Speedway segment earnings both for the fourth quarter and full-year. Speedway's income from operations was $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014 record quarterly income of $273 million. Lower gasoline and distillate margins were significant changes in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, decreasing segment income by $93 million. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged 18.23 cents per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 24.51 cents in the fourth quarter of 2014. The non-cash LCM charge of $25 million and higher operating expenses also had negative impacts on segment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
These unfavorable impact in the income were partially offset by higher merchandise margin, which increased from $324 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $16 million is a result of higher overall merchandise sales in addition to higher margins on those sales.
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were essentially flat, decreasing 3 tenths of a percent and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, decreased 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 2014. Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continue to strive to optimize total gasoline contribution between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
In January 2016, we've seen a slight increase in demand within approximately 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volume versus the prior year, impacted to some extent by the winter storms in the east in the last few weeks.
Speedway's income from operations for full-year 2015 was $673 million compared with $544 million for 2014. Results for 2015 include a full year of income from the operations acquired from Hess, we have 2014 results only include income form those locations in the fourth quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins increased $401 million from 2014, primarily due to higher volumes resulting from additional locations acquired as well as higher margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were 18.23 cents per gallon in 2015 compared to 17.75 cents per gallon in 2014.
Speedway's merchandise margin increased $393 million to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of locations as well as higher margins on the merchandise sold. Partially offsetting increases in Speedway income from operations for the year were higher operating expenses, primarily attributed to increasing in the number of stores.
Turning to Slide 9. As I mentioned, we changed the name of the segment this quarter, instead of a Pipeline Transportation segment, we now report a midstream segment, which continues to include 100% of MPLX' results, including income contributed by MarkWest since the December 4 merger. The addition of MarkWest is the only change to what's included in this segment.
Midstream segment income was $71 million and $289 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 compared with $58 million and $280 million for the comparable period in 2014. The decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest from the December 4 merger date and higher income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by $26 million of transaction costs associated with the merger.
The increase for the full year was primarily due to the MarkWest merger and higher transportation revenue resulting from higher average pipeline tariff rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs associated with the merger and higher pipeline operating expenses.
Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, our cash balance was $1.1 billion. Operating cash flow before changes to working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $340 million use of working capital, noted on the slide, primarily relates to a $693 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $361 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude and refined product prices during the quarter.
We completed a $1.5 billion public debt offering during the quarter, of which a little more than half was used to extinguish our obligation for the March 2016 3.5% notes. These new notes, net of some pay down on MPLX revolver resulted in the $655 million net source of financing cash shown in long term that year.
Cash flow is also impacted by the approximately $1.2 billion paid to former MarkWest unitholders as part of the transaction consideration during the quarter, which is shown separately on the graph.
As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. Returned a total of $362 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to $1.6 billion.
Turning to Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, representing a 28% increase over the dividend paid during the same quarter last year. We've increased our dividend 5x since becoming a stand-alone company in mid-2011, resulting in a 29.5% compound annual growth rate in dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividend demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to share in the success of the business, and we're pleased to affirm that commitment with a $0.32 per share dividend declared earlier this week.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization as of the end of the year. With just under $12 billion of total consolidated debt reflects the $6.7 billion of debt at MPC, plus the $5.3 billion of debt at MPLX, including the $4.1 billion of MarkWest notes assumed in the transaction.
Total debt to book capitalization was about 38% and represented a manageable 1.9x last 12 months consolidated EBITDA. Operating cash flow for the quarter was about $1.2 billion before reflecting the $342 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 13 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2015 capital expenditures and investments, excluding MPLX' acquisition of MarkWest, along with the revised capital plan for 2016.
In light of the challenging commodity price environment that Gary talked about, our focus will be to aggressively manage CapEx spending. As part of this process, MPLX lowered its 2016 capital plan from an estimated $1.7 billion to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the revised range represents a decrease of approximately $450 million from the previous forecast.
Throughout the course of '16, we'll continue to evaluate our capital program carefully and identify further opportunities to reduce or defer investments where appropriate, given the cash and capital constraints of the business.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2016. We're expecting first quarter throughput volumes of 1.7 million barrels per day, which are lower than fourth quarter 2015 volumes due to more planned maintenance this quarter. Our projected first quarter corporate and other unallocated items are expected to be about $85 million for the first quarter.

I guess we were evaluating the full year and there are a number of factors that we considered. Clearly, there is the pressure on volumes, but we're still seeing good volume growth and expect good volume growth in Marcellus and Utica to support our underlying business. We're very confident in the legacy MPLX business or the pipeline business. We're very confident in the steady cash flow of the Marine business that has been offered to MPLX. I would say probably the biggest factor that we have been considering and have been analyzing and evaluating is the yield environment and the pressure that the yield environment puts on growth as we're funding our growth and issuing new units or funding it with debt, that has put -- incremental pressure on that. So I would say that a lot of our decisions and our evaluation has not been based upon the underlying cash flows of the business, but it's really been a function of the way the market has performed since we announced the combination and even since early end of November when we're probably in the 4.5% kind of yield range. We're more than 200 basis points wide of that in just a couple of months time."

We see gasoline demand, as Tim stated, up 1%. And we see that continuing on and I think I stated in our Analyst Day meeting that we expect first quarter to be up over first quarter last year due to continued lower price versus same period last year.

I've always outlined that we believe that the differentiator in the MLP space is a quality of earnings and the quality of distribution growth. We've highlighted very clearly what that quality is and what the flexibilities we have. However, the market is the indicator on how that's going to be recognized. And today the entire market is under complete stress and the MLPs have backed up in that yield value. So we just think it's prudent at this time not to chase that yield. As I said, the last question I had at the Analyst Day meeting, we will continue to assess but there's no reason to chase the yield that is backing up when we have very, very high quality assets, very high distribution growth that we can make happen. I think it's just best that we settle back, we see how the entire market continues to recognize MLP investments.

Before I begin, I want to take the opportunity to introduce Lisa Wilson, our new Director of Investor Relations. Lisa is replacing Geri Ewing who is transferring to our finance department.

Lisa is replacing Geri Ewing who is transferring to our finance department. Lisa has nearly 25 years of experience for the company and was most recently our director of financial services and insurance.
We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $187 million, ending a strong year with $2.85 billion in earnings. These results include a $370 million pretax charge to value our inventory at lower cost to market. We remained very encouraged by the environment for U.S. refiners and we're pleased to see resilient crack spreads supported by attractive product price realizations and continued strong gasoline demand in the fourth quarter. We believe lower prices at the pump will remain constructive for retail demand as we move through 2016.
Crude oil prices continued to see pressure with the lifting of the Iranian sanctions, resiliency of domestic producers and [indiscernible] sentiment in the market. Crude differentials have been and will likely remain volatile.
WTI has traded at parity, and in fact, higher than Brent recently, and we expect this trading pattern could continue in the near term. However, longer-term, we believe it will revert back to a differential based on product quality and transportation cost between the grades.
We believe more favorable sweet/sour spreads will continue to exist and benefit MPC's complex refinery configuration in the Midwest and Gulf Coast.
In December, the Southern Access Extension Pipeline, or SAX, came online provided increased logistics flexibility and crude optionality, allowing us to more cost-effectively move Bakken and Canadian crudes into our Midwest refineries.
SAX allows MPC to access additional advantage crudes and adjust our slate based on the best economics. Speedway continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with nearly $1 billion of EBITDA.
I want to recognize Tony Kenney and his team's efforts in completing the planned conversions of our East Coast and Southeast retail locations to the Speedway brand well ahead of schedule. The team's aggressive execution strategy facilitated the realization of synergies from these locations much sooner than anticipated and beyond our original projections.
The acquisition of these high-quality assets has been a tremendous value driver and has exceeded our expectations in virtually every area. In addition to our strong financial and operational results in 2015, we also made tremendous progress in our strategic objectives of growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business and enhancing our refining margins. An example of enhancing our refining margins is a condensate splitter that came online in 2015 at our Catlettsburg refinery, which allows the refinery to process condensate produced in the region and thus improve its realized margins. 
Completion of the MPLX and MarkWest merger in early December was a significant accomplishment in the company strategy. Through this combination, we have created a diversified, large-cap MLP that positions the partnership as a midstream leader with compelling long-term growth opportunities.
We continued to believe MPLs will create substantial value to MPC shareholders through its general partner interest and associated incentive distribution rights, and we are eager to develop the numerous commercial synergies available to the combined partnership.
I would also like to comment on our long-term commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Through share buyback programs and dividends, we returned a total of $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015, including $362 million during the fourth quarter.
Delivering attractive capital returns to our shareholders continues to be an instrumental part of our strategy. Through year end 2015, we have purchased over $7 billion of MPC common stock or approximately 28% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. Our approach to the allocation of capital continues to be balanced and long-term in nature, taking into consideration the requirements of the business, returns to our shareholders and our overall capital structure.
As a result, we may increase or decrease the amount of share repurchase activity in any given year based on these variables. Through disciplined strategic investments in our business, and returning capital to shareholders, we remained focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. This discipline and prudent approach carries over to our sponsorship of MPLX. As we evaluate the continued decline in commodity prices, and the market's increasing belief that these price conditions will persist for some period of time, MPLX's producer customers are directly impacted. While MPLX's producers are in some of the best areas and continue to manage their capital and production plans very carefully, changes in volume growth will continue to impact the income growth for the partnership. At the same time, valuations within the MLP space, including MPLX, had been severely impacted, resulting in yield levels that are substantially higher than what we anticipated at the time of the merger, even with the strong support we expect to continue to make available through the partnership. These factors contributed to MPLX's decision to provide new distribution growth guidance.
Current market [indiscernible] to an expected 12% to 15% distribution growth rate for 2016, revised from the prior 25%. Even with this change, MPLX distribution growth continues to be among the highest for large-cap diversified MLPs. We were asked at our Investor Day meeting, if there's a tipping point as to when higher growth guidance will not make sense. I share then that if conditions did not improve in MPLX's valuation and resulting yield, we would likely revisit the growth outlook for the partnership. 
Based on the continued deterioration we have seen since then, we have reached that point and this change distribution growth is necessary. The commodity and equity market conditions we are now experience could be temporary and we will assess the growth path for 2017 later this year, providing guidance around the partnership's distribution growth capabilities at that time. We will take into consideration the capital allocation needs of both MPC and MPLX but expect to continue providing support to the partnership as it navigates through this challenging environment.
In support of MPLX's 2016 growth plans, MPC offered to contribute its inland marine business to MPLX at what we believe will be a supportive value and we anticipate receiving MPLX equity in exchange for these assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending requisite approvals.
This drop-down of additional logistics assets through the partnership further diversifies its high-quality earnings stream and underscores our flexibility -- our sponsorship as MPLX.
MPC is focused on strengthening the earnings power of all aspects of its business, with the expanded margin enhancing investments across the enterprise. We recently announced plans to invest $2 billion to our Galveston Bay refinery over the next 5 years and investment program collectively referred to as the South Texas Asset Repositioning program, or STAR. The investments planned as part of the STAR program, of which approximately $150 million will be spent in 2016, are intended to increase production of higher value products and improve the facility's reliability as well as increase processing capacity. These high return investments will fully integrate our Galveston Bay refinery with our Texas City refinery, making it the second-largest refinery in the U.S.
We expect a rapid payback on the stage investments plan for the STAR program, including an earning stream in 2016. By using the flexibility inherent in our refining system and optimizing our logistics and transportation network, we are able to react quickly to changing crude oil and refined product market conditions, maximizing our profitability.
In addition, as our downstream earnings demonstrate, our business produces strong results in a wide variety of commodity price environments. We remained optimistic on the long-term prospects for our business and continued to believe returns will be compelling, including our sponsorship and GP interest in MPLX.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the fourth quarter. Tim?"

Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. MPC had earnings of $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 diluted",1992,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. MPC had earnings of $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 diluted share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year 2015, our earnings were almost $2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share compared to 2014 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.39 per diluted share.
Chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter of 2015. As Gary mentioned, the earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $370 million pretax charge to adjust inventories to market values. $345 million of this charge is included in the Refining & Marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment.
After adjusting for the charge, earnings were down $374 million versus fourth quarter last year, largely attributable to our refining market -- Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments, partially offset by lower income taxes associated with the lower earnings. I'll talk about each of these segments and the changes compared to prior period shortly.
Results for the quarter also include income from the MarkWest since the December 4 merger date with MPLX, which is included in the renamed midstream segment, previously known as Pipeline Transportation, and we'll continue to consolidate MPLX for reporting purposes.
Turning to Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $207 million in the fourth quarter compared to just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower dollar-based refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower refined product prices.
In addition, the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected an unfavorable LIFO accounting effect of approximately $45 million as compared to a favorable effect of approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter of last year. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $784 million other gross margin step on the slide.
In addition, segment results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the $345 million LCM charge I just mentioned, which is broken out separately here. The unfavorable impacts on segment income were partially offset by higher LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads in Chicago and the Gulf coast, favorable market structure and improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter, along with slightly higher sour runs.
The blended crack was $6.65 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.43 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '14. You may recall the crack spreads, the crack spreads we provided in our market metrics on the website are calculated using prompt product and crude prices. The price we actually pay for crude, on the other hand, is established over the calendar month that we processed the crude, but takes no account the market structure. This contango effect is reflected in the $192 million favorable difference reflected as market structure on the walk and relates to this difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics in the actual crude acquisition cost.
Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is nearly $4.2 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a $1.3 billion favorable impact on full year earnings, with Chicago cracks $1.11 per barrel better than '15 and Gulf Coast cracks $1.88 per barrel higher.
Based on our estimated mix of 38% Chicago and 62% in Gulf Coast, resulted in the blended crack spread of $9.70 per barrel or about $1.59 better than 2014. In addition, favorable market structure, more favorable product price realizations and lower direct operating costs driven primarily by lower turnaround activity and lower purchase energy cost, had positive impacts on earnings year-over-year. These positive impacts on earnings were partially offset by less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower refinery volumetric gains.
In addition, the LCM and LIFO accounting impacts I described earlier also impacted 2015 full year earnings. The impact of more favorable product price realizations, less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to market indicators, lower volumetric gains and the unfavorable LIFO impact are all reflected in the $1.5 billion of other gross margin in the graph.
Other Refining & Marketing segment, net expenses increased $396 million compared to 2014 as a result of a number of items, including higher terminal and transportation cost and lower equity affiliated income.
Slide 8 shows the Speedway segment earnings walk for both the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway's income from operations was $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014 record quarterly income of $273 million. Lower gasoline and distillate margins were significant changes in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, decreasing segment income by $93 million. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $18.23 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $24.51 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The non-cash LCM charge of $25 million and higher operating expenses also had negative impacts on segment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
These unfavorable impacts in the income were partially offset by higher merchandise margin, which increased from $324 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $16 million increase is a result of higher overall merchandise sales in addition to higher margins on those sales.
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were essentially flat, decreasing 3/10 of 1% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, decreased 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 2014. Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
In January 2016, we've seen a slight increase in demand within approximately 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volume versus the prior year, impacted to some extent by the winter storms in the east in the last few weeks.
Speedway's income from operations for full year 2015 was $673 million compared with $544 million for 2014. Results for 2015 include a full year of income from the operations acquired from Hess, whereas 2014 results only include income form those locations in the fourth quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins increased $401 million from 2014, primarily due to higher volumes resulting from the additional locations acquired as well as higher margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $18.23 per gallon in 2015 compared to $17.75 per gallon in 2014.
Speedway's merchandise margin increased $393 million to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of locations as well as higher margins on the merchandise sold. Partially offsetting the increases in the Speedway income from operations for the year were higher operating expenses, primarily attributed to an increase in the number of stores.
Turning to Slide 9. As I mentioned, we changed the name of the segment this quarter, instead of a Pipeline Transportation segment, we now report a midstream segment, which continues to include 100% of MPLX's results, including income contributed by MarkWest since the December 4 merger. The addition of MarkWest is the only change to what's included in this segment.
Midstream segment income was $71 million and $289 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 compared with $58 million and $280 million for the comparable period in 2014. The decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest from the December 4 merger date and higher income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by $26 million of transaction costs associated with the merger.
The increase for the full year was primarily due to the MarkWest merger and higher transportation revenue resulting from higher average pipeline tariff rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs associated with the merger and higher pipeline operating expenses.
Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, our cash balance was $1.1 billion. Operating cash flow before changes to working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $343 million use of working capital, noted on the slide, primarily relates to a $693 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $361 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude and refined product prices during the quarter.
We completed a $1.5 billion public debt offering during the quarter, of which a little more than half was used to extinguish our obligation for the March 2016 3.5% notes. These new notes, net of some pay down on the MPLX revolver resulted in the $655 million net source of financing cash shown in long term debt here.
Cash flow is also impacted by the approximately $1.2 billion paid to former MarkWest unitholders as part of the transaction consideration during the quarter, which is shown separately on the graph.
As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We returned a total of $362 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to $1.6 billion.
Turning to Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, representing a 28% increase over the dividend paid during the same quarter last year. We've increased our dividend 5x since becoming a stand-alone company in mid-2011, resulting in a 29.5% compound annual growth rate in dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividend demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to share in the success of the business, and we're pleased to affirm that commitment with a $0.32 per share dividend declared earlier this week.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization as of the end of the year. With just under $12 billion of total consolidated debt reflects the $6.7 billion of debt at MPC, plus the $5.3 billion of debt at MPLX, including the $4.1 billion of MarkWest notes assumed in the transaction.
Total debt to book capitalization was about 38% and represented a manageable 1.9x last 12 months consolidated EBITDA. Operating cash flow for the quarter was about $1.2 billion before reflecting the $343 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 13 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2015 capital expenditures and investments, excluding MPLX's acquisition of MarkWest, along with our revised capital plan for 2016.
In light of the challenging commodity price environment that Gary talked about, our focus will be to aggressively manage CapEx spending. As part of this process, MPLX lowered its 2016 capital plan from an estimated $1.7 billion to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the revised range represents a decrease of approximately $450 million from the previous forecast.
Throughout the course of '16, we'll continue to evaluate our capital program carefully and identify further opportunities to reduce or defer investments where appropriate, given the cash and capital constraints of the business.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2016. We're expecting first quarter throughput volumes of 1.7 million barrels per day, which are lower than fourth quarter 2015 volumes due to more plant maintenance this quarter. Our projected first quarter corporate and other unallocated items are expected to be about $85 million for the first quarter.

So that is why we evolved really ratchet back our distribution growth, which is certainly part of the capital allocation as we look at it into MPLX. Don just mentioned, how far we have gone, so far it cut back to capital of MPLX and in the need -- if need be, we could even trim it back some more on the MPC and -- excuse me, on the MPLX side. What we've -- are clearly going to do and has always been part of our strategy and part of our flexibility is that we will manage to our capital budget if -- whether it's out of refining, whether it's out of midstream or whether it's out of retail, we will be able to ratchet back to maintain a strong balance sheet."

I guess we were evaluating the full year and there are a number of factors that we considered.

We're very confident in the legacy MPLX business or the pipeline business. We're very confident in the steady cash flow of the Marine business that has been offered to MPLX. I would say probably the biggest factor that we have been considering and have been analyzing and evaluating is the yield environment and the pressure that the yield environment puts on growth as we're funding our growth and issuing new units or funding it with that, that has put incremental pressure on that. So I would say that a lot of our decisions and our evaluation has not been based upon the underlying cash flows of the business, but it's really been a function of the way the market has performed since we announced the combination and even since early end of November when we're probably in the 4.5% kind of yield range.

We see gasoline demand, as Tim stated, up 1%. And we see that continuing on and I think I stated in our Analyst Day meeting that we would expect first quarter to be up over first quarter last year due to continued lower price versus same period last year.

We've highlighted very clearly what that quality is and what the flexibilities we have. However, the market is the indicator on how that's going to be recognized. And today the entire market is under complete stress and the MLPs are -- have backed up in that yield value. So we just think it is prudent at this time not to chase that yield. As I said at the last question I had at the Analyst Day meeting, we will continue to assess but there's no reason to chase the yield that is backing up when we have very, very high quality assets, very high distribution growth that we can make happen. I think it's just best that we settle back, we see how the entire market continues to recognize MLP investments.

We can look at potential modifications to GP cash flows, we've got a host of things that we'll look at. I'm not sure that there's a hard target number in terms of what support is necessary. But we'll continue to look at it and the totality of how the entities will manage each other and MPC is fully supportive of helping the partnership achieve the objective that it's got laid out. So we'll see what the environment holds. As Don indicated and Gary highlighted, the -- what really makes things challenging is the higher yield. I mean, obviously, for the partnership, every -- for every dollar of growth or earnings that goes into it, either on an organic or acquired basis, there's just that many more units that go out.

Again, there certainly some seasonal factors that enter into, but you're talking about things that would include sort of marketing transportation, other expenses that gets factored in. Again, I wouldn't say there's been any structural change to the sort of run rate around the expenses related. A lot of it will move higher based on some unplanned turnaround activity to the extent that comes in. We've certainly been impacted and benefited from the lower overall fuel cost related to natural gas. But I would say, as a structural matter, there's nothing that has moved dramatically and the notion that there is roughly $200 million gap, again, I think it's difficult to predict based on the environment. But with regard to the refining system itself, there's nothing that has structurally change that would impact that."

Lisa is replacing Geri Ewing, who is transferring to our finance department. Lisa has nearly 25 years of experience with the company and was most recently our director of financial services and insurance.
We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $187 million, ending a strong year with $2.85 billion in earnings. These results include a $370 million pretax charge to value our inventory at lower cost to market. We remain very encouraged by the environment for U.S. refiners, and we're pleased to see resilient crack spreads supported by attractive product price realizations and continued strong gasoline demand in the fourth quarter. We believe lower prices at the pump will remain constructive for retail demand as we move through 2016.
Crude oil prices continued to see pressure with the lifting of the Iranian sanctions, resiliency of domestic producers and a general bearish sentiment in the market. Crude differentials have been and will likely remain volatile.
WTI has traded at parity, and in fact, higher than Brent recently, and we expect this trading pattern could continue in the near term. However, longer-term, we believe it will revert back to a differential based on product quality and transportation cost between the grades.
We believe more favorable sweet/sour spreads will continue to exist and benefit MPC's complex refinery configuration in the Midwest and Gulf Coast.
In December, the Southern Access Extension Pipeline, or SAX, came online, providing increased logistics flexibility and crude optionality, allowing us to more cost-effectively move Bakken and Canadian crudes into our Midwest refineries.
SAX allows MPC to access additional advantaged crudes and adjust our slate based on the best economics. Speedway continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with nearly $1 billion of EBITDA.
I want to recognize Tony Kenney and his team's efforts in completing the planned conversions of our East Coast and Southeast retail locations to the Speedway brand well ahead of schedule. The team's aggressive execution strategy facilitated the realization of synergies from these locations much sooner than anticipated and beyond our original projections.
The acquisition of these high-quality assets has been a tremendous value driver and has exceeded our expectations in virtually every area. In addition to our strong financial and operational results in 2015, we also made tremendous progress on our strategic objectives of growing the more stable cash-flow segments of our business and enhancing our refining margins. An example of enhancing our refining margins is a condensate splitter that came online in 2015 at our Catlettsburg refinery, which allows the refinery to process condensate produced in the region and thus improve its realized margins. 
Completion of the MPLX and MarkWest merger in early December was a significant accomplishment in the company's strategy. Through this combination, we have created a diversified, large-cap MLP that positions the partnership as a midstream leader with compelling long-term growth opportunities.
We continue to believe MPLX will create substantial value to MPC shareholders through its general partner interest and associated incentive distribution rights, and we are eager to develop the numerous commercial synergies available to the combined partnership.
I would also like to comment on our long-term commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Through share buyback programs and dividends, we returned a total of $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015, including $362 million during the fourth quarter.
Delivering attractive capital returns to our shareholders continues to be an instrumental part of our strategy. Through year-end 2015, we have purchased over $7 billion of MPC common stock or approximately 28% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. Our approach to the allocation of capital continues to be balanced and long-term in nature, taking into consideration the requirements of the business, returns to our shareholders and our overall capital structure.
As a result, we may increase or decrease the amount of share repurchase activity in any given year based on these variables. Through disciplined strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders, we remain focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. This disciplined and prudent approach carries over to our sponsorship of MPLX. As we evaluate the continued decline in commodity prices, and the market's increasing belief that these price conditions will persist for some period of time, MPLX's producer customers are directly impacted. While MPLX's producers are in some of the best areas and continue to manage their capital and production plans very carefully, changes in volume growth will continue to impact the income growth for the partnership. At the same time, valuations within the MLP space, including MPLX, have been severely impacted, resulting in yield levels that are substantially higher than what we anticipated at the time of the merger, even with the strong support we expect to continue to make available through the partnership. These factors contributed to MPLX's decision to provide new distribution growth guidance.
Current market conditions warrant [indiscernible] to an expected 12% to 15% distribution growth rate for 2016, revised from the prior 25%. Even with this change, MPLX's distribution growth continues to be among the highest for large-cap diversified MLPs. We were asked at our Investor Day meeting if there's a tipping point as to when higher growth guidance would not make sense. I shared then that if conditions did not improve in MPLX's valuation and resulting yield, we would likely revisit the growth outlook for the partnership. 
Based on the continued deterioration we have seen since then, we have reached that point and this change in distribution growth is necessary. The commodity and equity market conditions we are now experiencing could be temporary, and we will assess the growth path for 2017 later this year, providing guidance around the partnership's distribution growth capabilities at that time. We will take into consideration the capital allocation needs of both MPC and MPLX, but expect to continue providing support to the partnership as it navigates through this challenging environment.
In support of MPLX's 2016 growth plans, MPC offered to contribute its inland marine business to MPLX at what we believe will be a supportive value, and we anticipate receiving MPLX equity in exchange for these assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending requisite approvals.
This drop-down of additional logistics assets through the partnership further diversifies its high-quality earnings stream and underscores our flexibility -- our sponsorship of [ph] MPLX.
MPC is focused on strengthening the earnings power of all aspects of its business with the expanded margin-enhancing investments across the enterprise. We recently announced plans to invest $2 billion to the Galveston Bay refinery over the next 5 years, an investment program collectively referred to as the South Texas Asset Repositioning program, or STAR. The investments planned as part of the STAR program, of which approximately $150 million will be spent in 2016, are intended to increase production of higher-value products and improve the facility's reliability, as well as increase processing capacity. These high-return investments will fully integrate our Galveston Bay refinery with our Texas City refinery, making it the second-largest refinery in the U.S.
We expect a rapid payback on the staged investments planned for the STAR program, including an earning stream in 2016. By using the flexibility inherent in our refining system and optimizing our logistics and transportation network, we are able to react quickly to changing crude oil and refined product market conditions, maximizing our profitability.
In addition, as our downstream earnings demonstrate, our business produces strong results in a wide variety of commodity price environments. We remain optimistic on the long-term prospects for our business and continue to believe returns will be compelling, including our sponsorship and GP interest in MPLX.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the fourth quarter. Tim?"

Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and per-share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. MPC had earnings of $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 per dil",1992,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings growth on an absolute and per-share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. MPC had earnings of $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year 2015, our earnings were almost $2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share compared to 2014 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.39 per diluted share.
The chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of 2015. As Gary mentioned, the earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $370 million pretax charge to adjust inventories to market values. $345 million of this charge is included in the Refining & Marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment.
After adjusting for the charge, earnings were down $374 million versus fourth quarter last year, largely attributable to our refining market -- Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments, partially offset by lower income taxes associated with the lower earnings. I'll talk about each of these segments and the changes compared to prior periods shortly.
Results for the quarter also include income from MarkWest since the December 4 merger date with MPLX, which is included in the renamed Midstream segment, previously known as Pipeline Transportation, and we'll continue to consolidate MPLX for reporting purposes.
Turning to Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $207 million in the fourth quarter compared to just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower dollar-based refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower refined product prices.
In addition, the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected an unfavorable LIFO accounting effect of approximately $45 million as compared to a favorable effect of approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter of last year. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $784 million other gross margin step on the slide.
In addition, segment results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the $345 million LCM charge I just mentioned, which is broken out separately here. The unfavorable impacts on segment income were partially offset by higher LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads in Chicago and the Gulf coast, favorable market structure and improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter, along with slightly higher sour runs.
The blended crack was $6.65 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.43 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '14. You may recall the crack spreads -- the crack spreads we provide in our market metrics on the website are calculated using prompt product and crude prices. The price we actually pay for crude, on the other hand, is established over the calendar month that we process the crude, but takes into account the market structure. This contango effect is reflected in the $192 million favorable difference reflected as market structure on the walk and relates to this difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost.
Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was nearly $4.2 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a $1.3 billion favorable impact on full year earnings, with Chicago cracks $1.11 per barrel better in '15 and Gulf Coast cracks $1.88 per barrel higher.
Based on our estimated mix of 38% Chicago and 62% in Gulf Coast, this resulted in the blended crack spread of $9.70 per barrel or about $1.59 better than 2014. In addition, favorable market structure, more favorable product price realizations and lower direct operating costs, driven primarily by lower turnaround activity and lower purchased energy cost, had positive impacts on earnings year-over-year. These positive impacts on earnings were partially offset by less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower refinery volumetric gains.
In addition, the LCM and LIFO accounting impacts I described earlier also impacted 2015 full year earnings. The impact of more favorable product price realizations, less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to market indicators, lower volumetric gains and the unfavorable LIFO impact, are all reflected in the $1.5 billion of other gross margin in the graph.
Other Refining & Marketing segment net expenses increased $396 million compared to 2014 as a result of a number of items, including higher terminal and transportation cost and lower equity-affiliated income.
Slide 8 shows the Speedway segment earnings walk for both the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway's income from operations was $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to fourth quarter 2014 record quarterly income of $273 million. Lower gasoline and distillate margins were significant changes in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, decreasing segment income by $93 million. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.1823 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.2451 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The non-cash LCM charge of $25 million and higher operating expenses also had negative impacts on segment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
These unfavorable impacts in the income were partially offset by higher merchandise margin, which increased from $324 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $16 million increase is a result of higher overall merchandise sales in addition to higher margins on those sales.
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were essentially flat, decreasing 3/10 of 1%, and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, decreased 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 2014. Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
In January 2016, we've seen a slight increase in demand, with an approximately 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volume versus the prior year, impacted to some extent by the winter storms in the east in the last few weeks.
Speedway's income from operations for full year 2015 was $673 million compared with $544 million for 2014. Results for 2015 include a full year of income from the operations acquired from Hess, whereas 2014 results only include income from those locations in the fourth quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins increased $401 million from 2014, primarily due to higher volumes resulting from the additional locations acquired as well as higher margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.1823 per gallon in 2015 compared to $0.1775 per gallon in 2014.
Speedway's merchandise margin increased $393 million to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the increase in the number of locations as well as higher margins on the merchandise sold. Partially offsetting the increases in the Speedway income from operations for the year were higher operating expenses, primarily attributed to an increase in the number of stores.
Turning to Slide 9. As I mentioned, we changed the name of the segment this quarter, instead of a Pipeline Transportation segment, we now report a Midstream segment, which continues to include 100% of MPLX's results, including income contributed by MarkWest since the December 4 merger. The addition of MarkWest is the only change to what's included in this segment.
Midstream segment income was $71 million and $289 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 compared with $58 million and $280 million for the comparable periods in 2014. The decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest from the December 4 merger date and higher income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by $26 million of transaction costs associated with the merger.
The increase for the full year was primarily due to the MarkWest merger and higher transportation revenue resulting from higher average pipeline tariff rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs associated with the merger and higher pipeline operating expenses.
Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, our cash balance was $1.1 billion. Operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.2 billion source of cash. The $343 million use of working capital, noted on the slide, primarily relates to a $693 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $361 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude and refined product prices during the quarter.
We completed a $1.5 billion public debt offering during the quarter, of which a little more than half was used to extinguish our obligation for the March 2016 3.5% notes. These new notes, net of some pay down on the MPLX revolver, resulted in the $655 million net source of financing cash shown in long-term debt here.
Cash flow was also impacted by the approximately $1.2 billion paid to former MarkWest unitholders as part of the transaction consideration during the quarter, which is shown separately on the graph.
As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We returned a total of $362 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to $1.6 billion.
Turning to Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, representing a 28% increase over the dividend paid during the same quarter last year. We've increased our dividend 5x since becoming a stand-alone company in mid-2011, resulting in a 29.5% compound annual growth rate in dividend. Our continued focus on growing the regular quarterly dividend demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to share in the success of the business, and we're pleased to affirm that commitment with the $0.32 per share dividend declared earlier this week.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization as of the end of the year. The just under $12 billion of total consolidated debt reflects the $6.7 billion of debt at MPC, plus the $5.3 billion of debt at MPLX, including the $4.1 billion of MarkWest notes assumed in the transaction.
Total debt-to-book capitalization was about 38% and represented a manageable 1.9x last-12-months consolidated EBITDA. Operating cash flow for the quarter was about $1.2 billion before reflecting the $343 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 13 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2015 capital expenditures and investments, excluding MPLX's acquisition of MarkWest, along with our revised capital plan for 2016.
In light of the challenging commodity price environment that Gary talked about, our focus will be to aggressively manage CapEx spending. As part of this process, MPLX lowered its 2016 capital plan from an estimated $1.7 billion to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the revised range represents a decrease of approximately $450 million from the previous forecast.
Throughout the course of '16, we'll continue to evaluate our capital program carefully and identify further opportunities to reduce or defer investments where appropriate, given the cash and capital constraints of the business.
Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2016. We're expecting first quarter throughput volumes of 1.7 million barrels per day, which are lower than fourth quarter 2015 volumes due to more planned maintenance this quarter. Our projected first quarter corporate and other unallocated items are expected to be about $85 million for the first quarter.

So far, we cut back to capital of MPLX and in the need -- if need be, we could even trim it back some more on the MPC and -- excuse me, on the MPLX side. What we are clearly going to do, and has always been part of our strategy and part of our flexibility, is that we will manage to our capital budget.

I guess we were evaluating the full year and there are a number of factors that we considered. Clearly, there has been pressure on volumes, but we're still seeing good volume growth and expect good volume growth in the Marcellus and Utica to support our underlying business. We're very confident in the legacy MPLX business or the pipeline business. We're very confident in the steady cash flow of the marine business that has been offered to MPLX. I would say probably the biggest factor that we have been considering and have been analyzing and evaluating is the yield environment and the pressure that the yield environment puts on growth. As we're funding our growth and issuing new units or funding it with debt, that has put incremental pressure on that. So I would say that a lot of our decisions and our evaluation has not been based upon the underlying cash flows of the business, but it's really been a function of the way the market has performed since we announced the combination, and even since early -- end of November, when we're probably in the 4.5% kind of yield range.

We see gasoline demand, as Tim stated, up 1%. And we see that continuing on. And I think I stated in our Analyst Day meeting that we would expect first quarter to be up over first quarter last year due to continued lower price versus same period last year.

We've highlighted very clearly what that quality is and what the flexibility is we have. However, the market is the indicator on how that's going to be recognized. And today, the entire market is under complete stress and the MLPs are -- have backed up in that yield value. So we just think it is prudent at this time not to chase that yield. As I said at the last question I had at the Analyst Day meeting, we will continue to assess, but there's no reason to chase the yield that is backing up when we have very, very high quality assets, very high distribution growth that we can make happen. I think it's just best that we settle back, we see how the entire market continues to recognize MLP investments.

And so we will continue to monitor that. We do have a lot of knobs to pull or levers to pull, and we feel like we can manage capital in a very, very efficient way. I mean, we expect, for example, that in fractionation or in processing in Utica and Marcellus, we would expect processing to increase by 20% year-over-year and fractionation to increase by 30% year-over-year. So we're expecting good volume increases, and we're going to make sure we're managing our capital appropriately to be able to support our producer customers."

And Paul, with regard to what's the maximum amount that MPC would be prepared to support, I mean, again, the commitment to supporting the partnership as the needs arise there, that support can take a number of different forms. We've highlighted this morning that the marine assets are being offered into the partnership at what we believe people will see as a very supportive multiple, that's a fantastic opportunity. We would be taking back all units for it, limiting the partnership's need to access the equity markets. We've got options with regard to intercompany funding, either on a loan or equity basis. We can look at potential modifications to GP cash flows. We've got a host of things that we'll look at. I'm not sure that there's a hard target number in terms of what support is necessary. But we'll continue to look at it in the totality of how the entities will manage each other, and MPC is fully supportive of helping the partnership achieve the objective that it's got laid out. So we'll see what the environment holds. As Don indicated and Gary highlighted, the -- what really makes things challenging is the higher yield. I mean, obviously, for the partnership, every -- for every dollar of growth or earnings that goes into it, either on an organic or acquired basis, there's just that many more units that go out. So we'll have to assess this as we move along. The support is there and we will remain flexible with regard to what forms make the most sense, given the time and circumstances involved."

I think that your share pie [ph] on both side probably we would do much better if you will be able to come up with an answer in a more direct way for that. My second question, Tim, is for you. When I'm looking at the refining operation, in addition to your manufacturing cost, your turnaround cost, your DD&A, there's a bottom, there's always a hole, sort of like the terminal cost and other expense on refining. In the past couple of years ago, that is roughly about running at $250 million a quarter. In the last several quarters, it seems like they are running at around in the $350 million to $375 million a quarter. So the question is that, is that a reasonable run rate going forward? And if it is, what may have caused the increase over the last couple of years?"

Again, there are certainly some seasonal factors that enter into it, but you're talking about things that would include sort of marketing, transportation, other expenses that get factored in. Again, I wouldn't say there's been any structural change to the sort of run rate around the expenses related. A lot of it will move higher based on some unplanned turnaround activity, to the extent that comes in. We've certainly been impacted and benefited from the lower overall fuel cost related to natural gas. But I would say, as a structural matter, there's nothing that has moved dramatically. And the notion that there is a roughly $200 million gap, again, I think it's difficult to predict based on the environment. But with regard to the refining system itself, there's nothing that has structurally changed that would impact that."

And if run cuts need to be made, the industry, I think, has been very quick to assess that. But back up, though, and say we don't see any issues today, we don't see any need for immediate run cuts.

118315802,329549362,966088,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and can you please turn to Slide 3.Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, FPLS, and a l",1022,"Thank you, Lisa, and can you please turn to Slide 3.
Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, FPLS, and a lower cost to market inventory charge. The lower earnings this quarter were largely attributable to weak crack spreads, especially in the first 2 months of the quarter as well as high turnaround activity.
We completed significant turnaround activity at the Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries ahead of schedule and under budget. As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned the light crude upgrade project at our Robinson refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refiner's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions.
We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, and an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. Even with the challenging market conditions at the first 2 months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of crack spreads late in the quarter as gasoline inventories decline and refiners responded to market conditions. In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing and it's attractive both for our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we are seeing more sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time as OPEC competes for market share.
SEC can capitalize on these opportunities since we can process even the very heavy high asset and high salted crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries.
We are also well positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation every form of capacity.
We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscores the value of our ongoing strategic objective through growing the core stable cash flow segments of our business.
Speedway continued its exceptional performance of the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volumes, Speedway's merchandise margins increased in the quarter, reflecting progress towards our goal to generate 2/3 of our profitability for merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of the East Coast and Southeast locations after the end of September 2014. We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business.
We're also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter while generating strong distributable cash flow to the partnership. Despite the challenging environment for midstream MLPs, we've remained enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe that partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve. Over 1/3 of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry areas, where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. 
Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates these processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization as expect this overall process best clients in this region to increase by approximately 15%, a normal increase in light of the current commodity environment.
At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX S, added support evaluation in exchange for additional and MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, drop-down process and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX. 
We continue to believe the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity in an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles. 
In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan.
MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility.
The combination of some opportunistic AGM issuance in the first quarter, combined with the supplier placement, provides for the partnership's funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. Therefore, enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value for the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early may.
Marathon is well positioned as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premiere retail assets and enhanced logistics and storage network and the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter."

MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest as well as a lower cost to market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our 21% equity interest in MPLX.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in refining and marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the full -- first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest.
Turning to Slide 6. Our refining and marketing segment reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the income from operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston bay, and a narrower LLS/WTI differential. In addition, we have less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrower crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impacts highlighted on the slide.
The lower blended crack spreads had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS/WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximately $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI link crudes in our slate.
The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating cost related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs which were 78,000 barrels per day lower in the first quarter last year.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost.
Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings compared to the first quarter last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast, so we're very pleased to the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes, and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some of the stickiness in price at the retail level when crude prices move rapidly as we experienced later in the first quarter.
On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year. Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter excluding cigarettes increased 3.1% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business.
In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April.
Slide 8 provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. Previously, the inland marine business and our investment in Ocean Partners were included in our refining and marketing segment.
First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine-related businesses in the Midstream segment. The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decrease in these accounts are primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter 2015, which led to the net use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.
Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance.
The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk.
We continued delivering our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased 75 million of shares and paid 169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activity may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors.
Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of just over -- close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of this year. We're expecting second quarter volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to the maintenance. Total direct operating cost are expected to be $6.75 per barrel on total throughputs of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity. Our projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items will be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa."

Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country.

And so our goal right now in the activities that we're undertaking are really focused on, relieving the excess volumes in the basin and allowing them to get to markets that are either more liquid or international markets. So our projects like rail to the East Coast are projects -- and this will be a little bit longer term but a consideration of butane alkylate, our efforts to load the unit trains, our -- the positive news about ethane being shipped from the basin over to the East Coast and making its way onto in international shipment.

With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices. And the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80, $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil at between $30 and $40 and $45. So I think we are very comfortable a t the 3 0 8 number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of 0 and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that at these absolute price levels that they were at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going forward basis. So there's a -- and I think there's an ocean at least crude prices that we necessarily need to build cash balances back.

But certainly, that is our expectation. That's in our goal. As we did the drop of the inland marine system, it was a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge and MPLX over this time of challenge within that the MLP market. And MPLX has responded very, very well since early February and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time. Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought that was very important to get this distraction at any overhang. Your question is spot on. What -- in order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right, we dropped the supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping those type of multiples going forward. And that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX but it takes that overhang and it takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next props, I think where we are situated now, we don't need to make any more drops in '16. We'll see how far out into '17 before we really do need to consider that. But our plan is as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or kind of rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last 3 or 4 months.

Obviously, through the first quarter you saw, common units yields, which were extraordinarily high and I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So with the amount of investor interest around these securities and structuring a security that we think makes  sense, as Gary said, provide a fantastic funding source. It takes '16 off the table, right into '17. And again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth and production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. What this will mean for sponsor support, I think MPC stands ready in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools. To step in to help support the partnership when there's sufficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And that's not available, MPC will stay ready. So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thoughts that MPC would provide this funding. MPC is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available at terms that we feel attractive, we thought that was a good session we move forward on."

I think that it improves demand if you get prices up and you get people in the oil fields, I think it's important again for the entire worldwide global demand sector. What I said in my remarks that I'm glad you brought it up is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the models and some other cargoes of Mars, medium and other look-alike type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sour spreads widen out. And I think that it's very supportive of the industry, very supportive to those refiners who have the ability to run this medium sour crude. And have the residual processing capability that handle and the reason and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season. So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners and at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meaning of the OpEx numbers here in May and I expect to see these places to put in place.

But you have severe weather in different pockets of the country every year. But it seemed to be more severe in the markets in which we operate today. But you're right, it has always historically somewhat of a predictor of the overall economy. I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side and they are down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand, yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies books, they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year we're going to be down 3% but as you know, we had tremendous growth in the cell in the last 3 or 4 years and I think some of that is just leveling off of what the demand has been.

What is overall the overall diesel demand equation, what happens to that in the near term? But as we see, and it's always been our position, we work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in pad. Pad 3, diesel inventory moves into pad 1, moves into pad 2, with the demands in any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly, the export demand for diesel going back to Doug's question about Venezuela and I think some other markets. We're continuing to see very strong demand but we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand as some of those export markets as well. So I understand your question. And I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and I'd be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, we don't do one of these products overnight. Their long-term in the planning and long-term that generally these a small upgrades or you get that supply, to have a major terror on cycle plan.

Don has done a very good job at being able to squeeze capital out of the midstream side, as well as Tony has on the retail side would be very efficient and probably to the backloads of projects where we saw was opportunistic to reduce summer capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books. My comments on capital deployment and getting back into share repurchases was that as we went through this big acquisition in Speedway, now almost 1.5 years ago. And that's, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating and MPLX, I believe, we are really have that grow going in the right direction that our plan is, as conditions improve and Tim just answered the question from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do but our strategy -- or I mean, we know we want to do but not to plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen.

There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces and certainly when we think about some of the investments in Speedway, in TNL, obviously the STAR project we've announced, we've sort of extended that to push it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably we'll continue to have flex capability to them depending on how things go. I mean, there are number of things thicken sort of setup and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve. And we see the earnings and cash flows that could support investment there. Or frankly, defer further, defer into '17 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an environment of capital that may be has a little bit less flexibility to it but we still have significant and we'll l to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustments."

So, for example, the cornerstone project will be completed by, we're projecting that will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the LNS business. On the GMP side of the business, this year, in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year, it's actually a higher proportion of gathering the pricing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes.

You'll see with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we have seen historically on the stack and feedstock into the system, those spreads relative to LS have come in as well. There's a little bit less opportunity again at these absolute levels to regard the benefits of feedstocks and then stocks into the system as well.

118315802,329549362,966513,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and could you please turn to Slide 3.Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and",1023,"Thank you, Lisa, and could you please turn to Slide 3.
Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and a lower cost-to-market inventory charge. The lower earnings this quarter were largely attributable to weak crack spreads, especially in the first 2 months of the quarter as well as high turnaround activity.
We completed significant turnaround activity at the Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries ahead of schedule and under budget. As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned a light crude upgrade project at our Robinson, Illinois refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refinery's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions. We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City and an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. 
Even with the challenging market conditions in the first 2 months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of crack spreads late in the quarter as gasoline inventories declined and refiners responded to market conditions. In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing and is attractive for both our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we're seeing more foreign sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time as OPEC competes for market share. 
MPC can capitalize on these opportunities since we can process even the very heavy high-asset and high-sulfer crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We're also well positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation and reforming capacity.
We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscores the value of our ongoing strategic objective to growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business. Speedway continued its exceptional performance in the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volume, Speedway's merchandise margin increased in the quarter, reflecting progress toward our goal to generate 2/3 of our profitability from merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of East Coast and Southeast locations after the end of September 2014. We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business.
We are also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter while generating strong distributable cash flow to the partnership. Despite the challenging environment for midstream MLPs, we've remained enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe that partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve. 
Over 1/3 of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry gas areas, where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates these processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization as it expects its overall process and gas clients from this region to increase by approximately 15%, a noble increase in light of the current commodity environment.
At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX at a supportive valuation in exchange for additional and MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, drop-down proceeds and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX. We continue to believe that the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. 
We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value-enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity and an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles. In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan.
MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third-party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility.
The combination of some opportunistic ATM issuances in the first quarter, combined with this private placement, provides for the partnership's anticipated funding need for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, therefore, enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value to the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early May.
MPC is well positioned to benefit as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premiere retail assets and an enhanced logistics and storage network with the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter."

Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charg",1379,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest as well as a lower cost for market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our then 21% equity interest in MPLX.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in Refining & Marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the full -- first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest.
Turning to Slide 6. Our Refining & Marketing segment Reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the income from operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston Bay, and a narrower LLS-WTI differential. In addition, we have less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrower crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impact highlighted on the slide.
The lower blended crack spreads had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximately $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.  
The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs, which were 78,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter last year.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs.
Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the first quarter last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast, so we are very pleased to see the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes, and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some of the stickiness in price at the retail level when crude prices move rapidly, as we experienced later in the first quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 3.1% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business. In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April.
Slide 8 provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. Previously, the inland marine business and our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners were included in our Refining & Marketing segment. First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine-related businesses in the Midstream segment. The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. 
The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decrease in these accounts are primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter 2015, which led to the net use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.
Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance. The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk.
We continued delivering on our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased $75 million of shares and paid $169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activities may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors.
Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of just over -- of close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of this year. We're expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be about $6.75 per barrel on total throughput of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity. Our projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items will be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa."

But let me speak to the overall refining segment first within the industry, Evan. And I guess I step back and look at it from a inventory position, and this [indiscernible] inventories for the first time, you see. And as I said in my script, I'm very pleased how the industry really have, I think, put runs into balance. If you look at PADD II, we are now spot on the same inventory levels as we were same time last year across PADD II: 0 increase in gasoline and 0 increase in ultra low-sulfur diesel the same periods. So I see that as very positive from where we were coming into the year. And I think that is -- really should provide for strength as we go into the gasoline season here at the end of Q2 and Q3. Secondly, the Gulf Coast, while gasoline is still a little bit up, there's still some turnarounds being finished in the Gulf Coast. And with the exports, I think the Gulf Coast can get into balance is we go into the summer-grade gasoline. They will get into balance very quickly. 
Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country. And specifically, we're the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the refining system, and we're expecting a big asphalt season. And with our ability to run a lot of sour crude oil and what we've been seeing widen out the Mars spread, and not only Mars, but if you look at several cargo opportunities, the sour crudes have really started to improve here in the second quarter. And we see that as very positive going into the balance of the second quarter and Q3. So Ray, do you want to talk about max gas versus max diesel?"

But as we go forward, to relieve any distraction within our business, as you recognize yesterday, we announced the convertible preferred. I thought it was important, the whole team thought it was important that we get any distraction, as I outlined at your conference when I spoke, to get any distraction between MPC and MPLX off the table, and we accomplished that with the $1 billion of convertible preferred that will take care of the capital budget of MPLX into 2017.

With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices. And the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80 or $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil at between $30 and $40 and $45. So I think we are very comfortable at the $308 million number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of 0 and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that at these absolute price levels, that we're at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going-forward basis. So there's -- I don't think there's a notion, at least at these crude prices, that we necessarily need to build cash balances back. I think we're comfortable with where we're at.

But certainly, that is our expectation and in our goal. As we did the drop of the inland marine system, it was at a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge MPLX over this time of challenge within the MLP market. MPLX has responded very, very well since early February and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time. Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought it was very important to get this distraction and any overhang. Your question is spot on. What -- in order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right, we dropped at a supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping at those type of multiples going forward, and that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX but it takes that overhang and it takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next drops, I think where we're situated now, we don't need to make any more drops in '16. We'll see how far out as '17 before we would need to consider that. But our plan is, as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or kind of rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last 3 or 4 months. Tim, do you want to add anything to that?"

Obviously, through the first quarter, you saw common units yields, which were extraordinarily high. And I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So with the amount of investor interest around these securities and structuring a security that we think makes sense at -- as Gary said, provides a fantastic funding source. It takes '16 off the table, right into '17 and again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth in production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. The -- what this will mean for sponsor support? I think MPC stands ready, in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools, to step in to help support the partnership. When there's efficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And when that's not available, MPC will stand ready. So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thought that MPC would provide this funding. MPC would -- is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available at terms that we thought attractive, we thought that was a very good decision to move forward on."

It's always been one of our key value quotients with inside Marathon.

So you want to have a very slow, gradual move, and we're seeing that happening. And I still stand by our thoughts that crude is going to continue to move, and I think that's beneficial across the entire energy sector. I think that it improves demand if you get prices up and you get people back working in the oil fields. I think it's important, again, for the entire worldwide global demand sector. What I said in my remarks that, I'm glad you brought it up, is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the Mars and some other cargoes of Mars, medium and other look-alike-type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sour spread widen out. And I think that is very supportive to the industry, very supportive to those refiners, who have the ability to run this medium sour crude and have the residual processing capability to handle any of the recent [ph] -- and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season. So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners. And at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meeting of the OPEC numbers here in May, and at time, I would expect to see these freezes put into place. And if that happens, I think it'll continue to have some pressure on the LLS grades as far as any spreads, but I think it will continue to benefit the medium sour players."

But it seemed to be more severe in the markets in which we operate today. But you're right, it has always historically been somewhat of a predictor of the overall economy. I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side, and they're down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand. Yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies books they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year we're going to be down 3% but remain flat. As you know, we had tremendous growth in diesel the last 3 or 4 years, and I think some of that is just leveling off of what the demand has been.

As I said earlier, we're back to -- all the diesel inventories across PADD II are balanced to where we were same period of last year, still up about 7 million barrels of inventory in PADD III. I think that can be cleared relatively easy as we go into the balance for the quarter. It's all going back to the question Doug had on, what is overall the over-the-road diesel demand equation? What happens to that in the near term? But as we see, and it's always been our position, we work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in PADD II. PADD III diesel inventory moves into PADD I, moves into PADD II with the demand and any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly is the export demand for diesel. Going back to Doug's question about Venezuela and I think some other markets, we're continuing to see very strong demand, but we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand in some of those export markets as well. So I understand your question, and I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, we don't do one of these projects overnight. They're long term in the planning and long-term, that generally these small upgrades or creep that you get that supply come when you have a major turnaround cycle planned. So it's all going to come back down to the balance of over-the-road demand and the balance of export demand going forward."

Our major projects, we are just embarking on very, very early stages of the big STAR project and that goes out 6 years for the south Texas asset redevelopment projects. So that goes out for a number of years, and we do not have any large projects or large-cap expenditures at any individual projects all at once. We will continue to look at the capital. Don has done a very good job in being able to squeeze capital out of the Midstream side as well as Tony has on the retail side to be very efficient and probably to backload some projects, where we saw was opportunistic to reduce some of our capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books. My comments on capital deployment to -- and getting back into share repurchases was that as we went through this big acquisition in Speedway, now 1.5 years ago, and that, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating. And MPLX, I believe, that we really have that going in the right direction, that our plan is, as conditions improve, and Tim just answered the question with -- from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do but our strategy -- or I mean, we know we want to do it but not to plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen. But we want to get back into a rhythm as we log in the next few years of being able to harvest from these businesses that we've acquired, and really set this company up very, very strong across all 3 segments of the business that we will be able to harvest and get back into a strong share buyback program over the long term."

Phil, what -- obviously, as Gary indicated, we have and will continue to look very carefully at capital. There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces -- and certainly, when we think about some of the investments in Speedway in T&L, obviously, the STAR project we announced, we've sort of extended that and pushed it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably would continue to have flex capability to them depending on how things go. I mean, there are number of things that we can sort of set up and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve, and we see the earnings and cash flows that could support the investment there, or frankly, defer further, defer into '17 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an element of capital that maybe has a little bit less flexibility to it. But we still have significant elements that we'll continue to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustment."

And in that 40% were a couple of projects that were underway that we are going to complete this year that won't continue on into next year, that give us some flexibility. So for example, the Cornerstone project will be completed by -- we're projecting that will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the L&S business. On the G&P side of the business, this year in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year, it's actually a higher proportion of gathering than processing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers, and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes. So I believe there's a lot of flex. I believe that the -- on the MPLX side particularly, capital is probably closer to a number that we had this year but we'll continue to manage that as the year progresses."

You'll see -- with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we had seen historically on the blend stock and feedstock into the system, those spreads relative to LLS have come in as well. There's a little bit less opportunity, again, at these absolute levels to garner the benefits of feedstocks and blend stocks into the system as well. So again, a lot of that has been sort of trending that way, just at the absolute levels and with some of the differentials coming off. And those are probably the biggest drivers of it. There's nothing in first quarter that was particularly unusual relative to the trends that we've seen really over the course of the last year."

Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and a lower cost-to-market inventory charge. The lower earnings this quarter were largely attributable to weak crack spreads, especially in the first 2 months of the quarter as well as high turnaround activity.
We completed significant turnaround activity at the Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries ahead of schedule and under budget. As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned a light crude upgrade project at our Robinson, Illinois refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refinery's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions. We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City and an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. 
Even with the challenging market conditions in the first 2 months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of crack spreads late in the quarter as gasoline inventories declined and refiners responded to market conditions. In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing and is attractive for both our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we're seeing more foreign sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time as OPEC competes for market share. 
MPC can capitalize on these opportunities since we can process even the very heavy high-acid and high-sulfur crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We're also well positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation and reforming capacity.
We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscores the value of our ongoing strategic objective to growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business. Speedway continued its exceptional performance in the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volume, Speedway's merchandise margin increased in the quarter, reflecting progress toward our goal to generate 2/3 of our profitability from merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of East Coast and Southeast locations after the end of September 2014. We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business.
We are also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter while generating strong distributable cash flow to the partnership. Despite the challenging environment for midstream MLPs, we've remained enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe that partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve. 
Over 1/3 of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry gas areas, where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers' growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates these processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization as it expects its overall process and gas clients from this region to increase by approximately 15%, a noble increase in light of the current commodity environment.
At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX at a supportive valuation in exchange for additional MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, drop-down proceeds and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX. We continue to believe that the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. 
We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value-enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity and an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles. In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan.
MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third-party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility.
The combination of some opportunistic ATM issuances in the first quarter, combined with this private placement, provides for the partnership's anticipated funding need for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, therefore, enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value to the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early May.
MPC is well positioned to benefit as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premiere retail assets and an enhanced logistics and storage network with the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter."

Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charg",1378,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest as well as a lower cost for market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our then 21% equity interest in MPLX.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in Refining & Marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the full -- first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest.
Turning to Slide 6. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the income from operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston Bay, and a narrower LLS-WTI differential. In addition, we have less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrower crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impact highlighted on the slide.
The lower blended crack spreads had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximately $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.  
The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs, which were 78,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter last year.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs.
Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the first quarter last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast, so we are very pleased to see the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes, and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some of the stickiness in price at the retail level when crude prices move rapidly, as we experienced later in the first quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 3.1% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business. In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April.
Slide 8 provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. Previously, the inland marine business and our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners were included in our Refining & Marketing segment. First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine-related businesses in the Midstream segment. The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. 
The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decrease in these accounts are primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter 2015, which led to the net use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.
Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance. The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk.
We continued delivering on our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased $75 million of shares and paid $169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activities may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors.
Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of just over -- of close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of this year. We're expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be about $6.75 per barrel on total throughput of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity.

But let me speak to the overall refining segment first within the industry, Evan. And I guess I step back and look at it from a inventory position, and this [indiscernible] inventories for the first time, you see. And as I said in my script, I'm very pleased how the industry really have, I think, put runs into balance. If you look at PADD II, we are now spot on the same inventory levels as we were same time last year across PADD II: 0 increase in gasoline and 0 increase in ultra low-sulfur diesel the same periods. So I see that as very positive from where we were coming into the year. And I think that is -- really should provide for strength as we go into the gasoline season here at the end of Q2 and Q3. Secondly, the Gulf Coast, while gasoline is still a little bit up, there's still some turnarounds being finished in the Gulf Coast. And with the exports, I think the Gulf Coast can get into balance as we go into the summer-grade gasoline. They will get into balance very quickly. 
Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country. And specifically, we're the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the refining system, and we're expecting a big asphalt season. And with our ability to run a lot of sour crude oil and what we've been seeing widen out the Mars spread, and not only Mars, but if you look at several cargo opportunities, the sour crudes have really started to improve here in the second quarter. And we see that as very positive going into the balance of the second quarter and Q3. So Ray, do you want to talk about max gas versus max diesel?"

I think as it relates specifically to MPLX and our producer customers, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica, absolute prices are important but so is basis differential. And one of the challenges that they had, particularly last summer, was there were discounts from other markets. And so our goal right now and the activities that we are undertaking are really focused on relieving the excess volumes in the basin and allowing them to get to markets that are either more liquid or international markets. So our projects, like rail to the East Coast, our projects like -- and this will be a little bit longer term but a consideration of butane to alkylate. Our efforts to load the unit trains are -- the positive news about ethane being shipped from the basin over to the East Coast and making its way onto an international shipment, those are all very positive in our view for the producer customers that we have a regular interaction with and that impact our business the most."

But as we go forward, to relieve any distraction within our business, as you recognize yesterday, we announced the convertible preferred. I thought it was important, the whole team thought it was important that we get any distraction, as I outlined at your conference when I spoke, to get any distraction between MPC and MPLX off the table, and we accomplished that with the $1 billion of convertible preferred that will take care of the capital budget of MPLX into 2017. Secondly, as we continue to digest this acquisition -- Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in being able to digest the Hess acquisition, is that we're going to get into a mode and into a rhythm of being able to harvest the cash from these businesses and build up that stockpile of cash and clearly, intend to get back into a more robust share repurchase program as we go down the road.

With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through. 
Our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices. And the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80 or $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil at between $30 and $40 and $45. So I think we are very comfortable at the $308 million number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of 0 and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that at these absolute price levels, that we're at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going-forward basis. So there's -- I don't think there's a notion, at least at these crude prices, that we necessarily need to build cash balances back. I think we're comfortable with where we're at. But as Gary said, a lot of opportunity for sort of earnings enhancements as we go forward, and we'll certainly have those levers available to us though."

But certainly, that is our expectation and in our goal. As we did the drop of the inland marine system, it was at a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge MPLX over this time of challenge within the MLP market. MPLX has responded very, very well since early February and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time. Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought it was very important to get this distraction and any overhang. Your question is spot on. What -- in order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right, we dropped at a supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping at those type of multiples going forward, and that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX but it takes that overhang and it takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next drops, I think where we're situated now, we don't need to make any more drops in '16. We'll see how far out as '17 before we would need to consider that. But our plan is, as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or kind of rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last 3 or 4 months.

Obviously, through the first quarter, you saw common units yields, which were extraordinarily high. And I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So with the amount of investor interest around these securities and structuring a security that we think makes sense at -- as Gary said, provides a fantastic funding source. It takes '16 off the table, right into '17 and again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth in production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. The -- what this will mean for sponsor support? I think MPC stands ready, in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools, to step in to help support the partnership. When there's efficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And when that's not available, MPC will stand ready. So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thought that MPC would provide this funding. MPC would -- is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available at terms that we thought attractive, we thought that was a very good decision to move forward on."

It's always been one of our key value quotients with inside Marathon. We've gone back and done a lot of work on some other transactions that have happened historically where companies spun off their retail and appeared to be a pretty small bump in share value that can be eroded for many different reasons across the value chain.

And Brent topped $47 yesterday and looks to have a momentum going into today. And I still believe that crude is -- will continue. And what's so important is that this inches up slowly. You do not want a spike on a very short-term basis because I think the pain on a spike and then coming off that spike would be -- will have longer-lasting effects on the marketplace. So you want to have a very slow, gradual move, and we're seeing that happening. And I still stand by our thoughts that crude is going to continue to move, and I think that's beneficial across the entire energy sector. I think that it improves demand if you get prices up and you get people back working in the oil fields. I think it's important, again, for the entire worldwide global demand sector. What I said in my remarks that, I'm glad you brought it up, is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the Mars and some other cargoes of Mars, medium and other look-alike-type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sour spread widen out. And I think that is very supportive to the industry, very supportive to those refiners, who have the ability to run this medium sour crude and have the residual processing capability to handle any of the resid -- and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season. So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners. And at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meeting of the OPEC members here in May, and at that time, I would expect to see these freezes put into place. And if that happens, I think it'll continue to have some pressure on the LLS grades as far as any spreads, but I think it will continue to benefit the medium sour players."

Due to some of the -- if you go back to the first quarter, we just analyzed our diesel demand, over-the-road diesel demand in the first quarter. And there were times across the eastern seaboard that we lost 4 and 5 days of diesel demand because of severe weather. But you have severe weather in different pockets of the country every year. But it seemed to be more severe in the markets in which we operate today. But you're right, it has always historically been somewhat of a predictor of the overall economy. I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side, and they're down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand. Yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies books they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year we're going to be down 3% but remain flat. As you know, we had tremendous growth in diesel the last 3 or 4 years, and I think some of that is just leveling off of what the demand has been. But we still -- you go back and look the last 3 or 4 years, probably in total, up around 10%. So when your average is out, I think the market is still fairly good."

As I said earlier, we're back to -- all the diesel inventories across PADD II are balanced to where we were same period of last year, still up about 7 million barrels of inventory in PADD III. I think that can be cleared relatively easy as we go into the balance for the quarter. It's all going to come back to the question Doug had on, what is overall the over-the-road diesel demand equation? What happens to that in the near term? But as we see, and it's always been our position, we work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in PADD II. PADD III diesel inventory moves into PADD I, moves into PADD II with the demand and any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly is the export demand for diesel. Going back to Doug's question about Venezuela and I think some other markets, we're continuing to see very strong demand, but we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand in some of those export markets as well. So I understand your question, and I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, you don't do one of these projects overnight. They're long term in the planning and long-term, that generally these small upgrades or creep that you get in that supply come when you have a major turnaround cycle planned. So it's all going to come back down to the balance of over-the-road demand and the balance of export demand going forward."

So that goes out for a number of years, and we do not have any large projects or large-cap expenditures at any individual project all at once. We will continue to look at the capital. Don has done a very good job in being able to squeeze capital out of the Midstream side as well as Tony has on the retail side to be very efficient and probably to backload some projects, where we saw was opportunistic to reduce some of our capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books. My comments on capital deployment to -- and getting back into share repurchases was that as we went through this big acquisition in Speedway, now 1.5 years ago, and that, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating. And MPLX, I believe, that we really have that going in the right direction, that our plan is, as conditions improve, and Tim just answered the question with -- from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do but our strategy -- or I mean, we know we want to do it but not to plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen. But we want to get back into a rhythm as we log in the next few years of being able to harvest from these businesses that we've acquired, and really set this company up very, very strong across all 3 segments of the business that we will be able to harvest and get back into a strong share buyback program over the long term."

Phil, what -- obviously, as Gary indicated, we have and will continue to look very carefully at capital. There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces -- and certainly, when we think about some of the investments in Speedway in T&L, obviously, the STAR project we announced, we've sort of extended that and pushed it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably would continue to have flex capability to them depending on how things go. I mean, there are a number of things that we can sort of set up and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve, and we see the earnings and cash flows that could support the investment there, or frankly, defer further, defer into '17 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an element of capital that maybe has a little bit less flexibility to it. But we still have significant elements that we'll continue to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustment."

And in that 40% were a couple of projects that were underway that we are going to complete this year that won't continue on into next year, that give us some flexibility. So for example, the Cornerstone project will be completed by -- we're projecting that will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the L&S business. On the G&P side of the business, this year in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year, it's actually a higher proportion of gathering than processing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers, and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes. So I believe there's a lot of flex. I believe that the -- on the MPLX side particularly, capital is probably closer to a number that we had this year but we'll continue to manage that as the year progresses."

You'll see -- with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we had seen historically on the blend stock and feedstock into the system, those spreads relative to LLS have come in as well. There's a little bit less opportunity, again, at these absolute levels to garner the benefits of feedstocks and blend stocks into the system as well. So again, a lot of that has been sort of trending that way, just at the absolute levels and with some of the differentials coming off. And those are probably the biggest drivers of it.

118315802,329549362,968115,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and could you please turn to Slide 3.Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and",1022,"Thank you, Lisa, and could you please turn to Slide 3.
Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and a lower cost-to-market inventory charge. The lower earnings this quarter were largely attributable to weak crack spreads, especially in the first 2 months of the quarter as well as high turnaround activity.
We completed significant turnaround activity at the Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries ahead of schedule and under budget. As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned a light crude upgrade project at our Robinson, Illinois refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refinery's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions. We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City and an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. 
Even with the challenging market conditions in the first 2 months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of crack spreads late in the quarter as gasoline inventories declined and refiners responded to market conditions. In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing and is attractive for both our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we're seeing more foreign sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time as OPEC competes for market share. 
MPC can capitalize on these opportunities since we can process even the very heavy high-acid and high-sulfur crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We're also well positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation and reforming capacity.
We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscores the value of our ongoing strategic objective to growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business. Speedway continued its exceptional performance in the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volume, Speedway's merchandise margin increased in the quarter, reflecting progress toward our goal to generate 2/3 of our profitability from merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of East Coast and Southeast locations after the end of September 2014. We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business.
We are also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter while generating strong distributable cash flow to the partnership. Despite the challenging environment for midstream MLPs, we've remained enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe that partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve. 
Over 1/3 of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry gas areas, where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers' growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates these processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization as it expects its overall process and gas clients from this region to increase by approximately 15%, a noble increase in light of the current commodity environment.
At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX at a supportive valuation in exchange for additional MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, drop-down proceeds and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX. We continue to believe that the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. 
We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value-enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity and an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles. In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan.
MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third-party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility.
The combination of some opportunistic ATM issuances in the first quarter, combined with this private placement, provides for the partnership's anticipated funding need for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, therefore, enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value to the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early May.
MPC is well positioned to benefit as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premiere retail assets and an enhanced logistics and storage network with the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter."

Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charg",1378,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest as well as a lower cost for market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our then 21% equity interest in MPLX.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in Refining & Marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the full -- first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest.
Turning to Slide 6. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the income from operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston Bay, and a narrower LLS-WTI differential. In addition, we have less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrower crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impact highlighted on the slide.
The lower blended crack spreads had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximately $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.  
The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs, which were 78,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter last year.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs.
Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the first quarter last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast, so we are very pleased to see the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes, and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some of the stickiness in price at the retail level when crude prices move rapidly, as we experienced later in the first quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 3.1% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business. In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April.
Slide 8 provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. Previously, the inland marine business and our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners were included in our Refining & Marketing segment. First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine-related businesses in the Midstream segment. The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. 
The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decrease in these accounts are primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter 2015, which led to the net use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.
Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance. The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk.
We continued delivering on our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased $75 million of shares and paid $169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activities may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors.
Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of just over -- of close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of this year. We're expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be about $6.75 per barrel on total throughput of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity. Our projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items will be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa."

But let me speak to the overall refining segment first within the industry, Evan. And I guess I step back and look at it from a inventory position, and this [indiscernible] inventories for the first time, you see. And as I said in my script, I'm very pleased how the industry really have, I think, put runs into balance. If you look at PADD II, we are now spot on the same inventory levels as we were same time last year across PADD II: 0 increase in gasoline and 0 increase in ultra low-sulfur diesel the same periods. So I see that as very positive from where we were coming into the year. And I think that is -- really should provide for strength as we go into the gasoline season here at the end of Q2 and Q3. Secondly, the Gulf Coast, while gasoline is still a little bit up, there's still some turnarounds being finished in the Gulf Coast. And with the exports, I think the Gulf Coast can get into balance as we go into the summer-grade gasoline. They will get into balance very quickly. 
Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country. And specifically, we're the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the refining system, and we're expecting a big asphalt season. And with our ability to run a lot of sour crude oil and what we've been seeing widen out the Mars spread, and not only Mars, but if you look at several cargo opportunities, the sour crudes have really started to improve here in the second quarter. And we see that as very positive going into the balance of the second quarter and Q3. So Ray, do you want to talk about max gas versus max diesel?"

With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices. And the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80 or $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil at between $30 and $40 and $45. So I think we are very comfortable at the $308 million number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of 0 and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that at these absolute price levels, that we're at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going-forward basis. So there's -- I don't think there's a notion, at least at these crude prices, that we necessarily need to build cash balances back. I think we're comfortable with where we're at.

But certainly, that is our expectation and in our goal. As we did the drop of the inland marine system, it was at a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge MPLX over this time of challenge within the MLP market. MPLX has responded very, very well since early February and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time. Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought it was very important to get this distraction and any overhang. Your question is spot on. What -- in order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right, we dropped at a supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping at those type of multiples going forward, and that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX but it takes that overhang and it takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next drops, I think where we're situated now, we don't need to make any more drops in '16. We'll see how far out as '17 before we would need to consider that. But our plan is, as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or kind of rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last 3 or 4 months. Tim, do you want to add anything to that?"

Obviously, through the first quarter, you saw common units yields, which were extraordinarily high. And I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So with the amount of investor interest around these securities and structuring a security that we think makes sense at -- as Gary said, provides a fantastic funding source. It takes '16 off the table, right into '17 and again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth in production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. The -- what this will mean for sponsor support? I think MPC stands ready, in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools, to step in to help support the partnership. When there's efficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And when that's not available, MPC will stand ready. So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thought that MPC would provide this funding. MPC would -- is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available at terms that we thought attractive, we thought that was a very good decision to move forward on."

It's always been one of our key value quotients with inside Marathon. We've gone back and done a lot of work on some other transactions that have happened historically where companies spun off their retail and appeared to be a pretty small bump in share value that can be eroded for many different reasons across the value chain.

And Brent topped $47 yesterday and looks to have a momentum going into today. And I still believe that crude is -- will continue. And what's so important is that this inches up slowly. You do not want a spike on a very short-term basis because I think the pain on a spike and then coming off that spike would be -- will have longer-lasting effects on the marketplace. So you want to have a very slow, gradual move, and we're seeing that happening. And I still stand by our thoughts that crude is going to continue to move, and I think that's beneficial across the entire energy sector. I think that it improves demand if you get prices up and you get people back working in the oil fields. I think it's important, again, for the entire worldwide global demand sector. What I said in my remarks that, I'm glad you brought it up, is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the Mars and some other cargoes of Mars, medium and other look-alike-type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sour spread widen out. And I think that is very supportive to the industry, very supportive to those refiners, who have the ability to run this medium sour crude and have the residual processing capability to handle any of the resid -- and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season. So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners. And at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meeting of the OPEC members here in May, and at that time, I would expect to see these freezes put into place. And if that happens, I think it'll continue to have some pressure on the LLS grades as far as any spreads, but I think it will continue to benefit the medium sour players."

I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side, and they're down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand. Yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies books they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year we're going to be down 3% but remain flat.

I think that can be cleared relatively easy as we go into the balance for the quarter. It's all going to come back to the question Doug had on, what is overall the over-the-road diesel demand equation? What happens to that in the near term? But as we see, and it's always been our position, we work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in PADD II. PADD III diesel inventory moves into PADD I, moves into PADD II with the demand and any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly is the export demand for diesel. Going back to Doug's question about Venezuela and I think some other markets, we're continuing to see very strong demand, but we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand in some of those export markets as well. So I understand your question, and I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, you don't do one of these projects overnight. They're long term in the planning and long-term, that generally these small upgrades or creep that you get in that supply come when you have a major turnaround cycle planned. So it's all going to come back down to the balance of over-the-road demand and the balance of export demand going forward."

Our major projects, we are just embarking on very, very early stages of the big STAR project and that goes out 6 years for the south Texas asset redevelopment projects. So that goes out for a number of years, and we do not have any large projects or large-cap expenditures at any individual project all at once. We will continue to look at the capital. Don has done a very good job in being able to squeeze capital out of the Midstream side as well as Tony has on the retail side to be very efficient and probably to backload some projects, where we saw was opportunistic to reduce some of our capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books. My comments on capital deployment to -- and getting back into share repurchases was that as we went through this big acquisition in Speedway, now 1.5 years ago, and that, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating. And MPLX, I believe, that we really have that going in the right direction, that our plan is, as conditions improve, and Tim just answered the question with -- from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do but our strategy -- or I mean, we know we want to do it but not to plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen. But we want to get back into a rhythm as we log in the next few years of being able to harvest from these businesses that we've acquired, and really set this company up very, very strong across all 3 segments of the business that we will be able to harvest and get back into a strong share buyback program over the long term."

Phil, what -- obviously, as Gary indicated, we have and will continue to look very carefully at capital. There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces -- and certainly, when we think about some of the investments in Speedway in T&L, obviously, the STAR project we announced, we've sort of extended that and pushed it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably would continue to have flex capability to them depending on how things go. I mean, there are a number of things that we can sort of set up and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve, and we see the earnings and cash flows that could support the investment there, or frankly, defer further, defer into '17 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an element of capital that maybe has a little bit less flexibility to it. But we still have significant elements that we'll continue to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustment."

And in that 40% were a couple of projects that were underway that we are going to complete this year that won't continue on into next year, that give us some flexibility. So for example, the Cornerstone project will be completed by -- we're projecting that will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the L&S business. On the G&P side of the business, this year in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year, it's actually a higher proportion of gathering than processing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers, and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes. So I believe there's a lot of flex. I believe that the -- on the MPLX side particularly, capital is probably closer to a number that we had this year but we'll continue to manage that as the year progresses."

You'll see -- with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we had seen historically on the blend stock and feedstock into the system, those spreads relative to LLS have come in as well. There's a little bit less opportunity, again, at these absolute levels to garner the benefits of feedstocks and blend stocks into the system as well. So again, a lot of that has been sort of trending that way, just at the absolute levels and with some of the differentials coming off. And those are probably the biggest drivers of it.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per share. Earnings included net benefited  of $0.44 per share, primarily related to a reversal of our lower cost of market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spread's, robust product demand entering the summer driving and Asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of MarkWest in our consolidated results. 
The refining and marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable comforting and marketing conditions during the quarter. Our integrated refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials, as well as enhanced price realization to are refined product distribution system.
Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize the operations even during this disruption, such as those costs in the second quarter by the Canadian and refinery outages.
Speedway continued its outstanding performance with record set second quarter segment income. In addition, to higher like product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter.
This improvement is consistent with a strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We're pleased with our progress and realizing synergies across the Speedway network, earlier than originally planned and believe this will be continued source of value to the business.
Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPCs integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhance overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining pipeline and terminal operations.
The Midstream segment including MPLX financial and operational results also delivered strong comments during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve it's 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional drop-down from MPC during the year. 
During the quarter, MPLX expanded its Midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its gas process complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations.
Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with completion expected in fourth quarter. Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's refinery with the direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline into our Midwest refineries. 
As commodity prices recovered, excuse me optimism is growing among MPLX's produce customers and with world-class Mistry mass located in some of the best resource place in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain. 
As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have written to more favorable levels, as the impact of the Canadian qualifiers subsided.
Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expect good values for third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign suit and cargos. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enables us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe, we have the right assets in the right locations with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest.
We're also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year start program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower value residual oil into gas oil. The EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year.
During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27, our board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. That 29% compound annual growth rate in our dividends since MPC became an independent company, demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business.
It also demonstrates our long-term focus on capital returns, while maintaining an investment credit grade profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle.
The efficiency and flexibility of our retail refining systems drives to diversify our earnings power of our business and we remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter."

Slide 4 provides earnings on both absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last years second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.44 per share net benefit in the quarter, which included the investment of $0.47 per diluted share related to a reversal of lower of cost market inventory valuation reserve, and charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to impairment of 1 MPLX equity investments.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted in the quarter by $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower cost to market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in refining and marketing segment, and $25 million is reflected in Speedway segment.
After adjusting for this benefit earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our refining market segment, higher interest expense resulting from MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned.
This negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our Midstream and Speedway segment and lower income taxes.
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining and Marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LTM reversal was primarily due to weaker crack spread's and both Gulf coast or Chicago and WTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher cost related activity in the second quarter.
Partially offsetting these negative impact was an improvement in the differential in the quarter. The lower branded crack spread had a negative impact in earnings of approximately $502 million, the blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year.
segment benefited $227 million by approximately $2 per barrel differential as well as higher severance in the quarter versus last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. Which had a negative impact in earnings about $100 million based on the WTI link crudes in our 
 
The market structure effect during the quarter is reflected $78 million unfavorable variance on the and a relates to the difference between the comp prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter.
The $70 million increase year-over-year in direct operating costs related primarily higher turnover activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million compared to second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs, which was 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. 
Captured rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the fact of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrow crude differentials and differentials on feedstocks relative to crude. 
Turning to our other segments Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million, which was up to $66 million higher than the second quarter of 2015. 
Light product margin was significant contributor of this increase, along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedways lower cost of market inventory reserves in the quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher in the second quarter of last year, then in the second quarter of last year at $0.15.5 per gallon, while volumes were up $33 million-gallon quarter-over-quarter. And same-store basis gasoline sales volumes increased over the same period last year. Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes increased 2% out of same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the profits we're making on enhancing merchandise model across the entire business.
In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 1% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July.  Which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015.
Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. growth, as we continually to optimized total gasoline contribution between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Slide 8 provides the change in Midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents a significant element of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of quarter was nearly $1.8 billion, core operating cash flow was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and crude liabilities, partially offset by smaller increase in accounts receivable. 
The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter, which led to the net source of cash, given the generally longer-term crude payables versus refined products.
As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. 
Proceeds from this private replacement have broken out separately in the log. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver, which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the Return of capital during the quarter included a repurchase of $51 million of worth of shares and $170 million of dividend. Share repurchase activity may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period.
Our commitment to continue to return the capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, which approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time of the spend. 
In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per share dividend announced by our board yesterday, represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spend.
Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. 
Total debt to per capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable to 2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion, which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter in 2015 due to more plant maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items expected to be about $75 million.

But when you look at on arbitrage Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is? Now the integration value is, I would I can't give a out number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant.

And as I've mentioned several times, you look at first half of this year the EBITDA from Speedway the first half of this year, clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital.

So that's sort of our primary focus to make sure that we sort of baseline the capital turn around in attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle. 
Share purchase for us continues to be sort of a flyable depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective, and so how we're viewing things. Obviously, we've taken down our capital spending plans in 2016. And I think some of the reductions that we've seen on the share purchase side has gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like. But I think it will continue to be an important source, and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position, we find ourselves in as we move forward.

When I look at the inventories, that came out yesterday Neil in the pads where we predominantly operate, gasoline and is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year and we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in a pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories, but pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for Pad 3 and early into Pad 4, it appears to be a significant turnaround and schedule somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. 
And then, of course, we're going to switch to the winter gasoline for long. On distillates both PADD II and PADD III we are fairly balanced on distillates, the way I look at across the chain or actually say across the industry. But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good results in the past that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause a degradation in margins into the future, but this looks pretty good shape right now gasoline PADD II pretty good shape, it's just PADD III gasoline is a bit high."

And then the other key to watch within MPLX as well, if you look at our capacity utilization, as commodity prices improve, we have a tremendous amount of basically free space to be able to fill up some of the capacity that we already have invested in, that will fall directly to the bottom line. 
So we're expecting that, our yield as well as continue to improve with the solid performance again, that we have had a balance sheet are in good order.

So very focused on moving NGL's to the East Coast, and I can say that project is probably the 1 that's for ahead in terms of a in-service date and getting a solution. We're also looking at moving NGL's to the Gulf Coast and have been in regular discussion with our partner, enterprise on Centennial and evaluating the feasibility of a reversal of Centennial. And then the third major project that we have been spending a lot of time on is a project to a butane to alkylate project, that would likely be position somewhere near our processing facilities in the Utica Marcella's, and that would allow us to convert butane to alkylate and a while our producer customers to see an uplift in their overall valuation.

Regarding distillate and gasoline and winter grade production, right now we're producing summer grade and we have a about 2 months before we can legally sell start selling higher gasoline to our customers. So we're still in that mode. 
Now as far as this led to gasoline, as you know, the economics have changed frequently and right now permanently we're pointed towards diesel. And just to give you a little flavor, we have about 10% swing that we have the ability to swing back and forth on our swing between gasoline and diesel."

But we're also finding that we've had diesel cargos that are making its way over here. So that part has been more difficult, but still works under certain circumstances.

We're bringing in more spot, sour cargoes then typically we have been able to find value in. 
And because Galveston Bay and Gary Will have the ability to run the heavy more difficult crude, high 10 crudes. That's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount. So we see that continuing to go forward. 
In terms of the additional WTI kind of base crudes that's going to shift back and forth depending on what's happening at the plants, what crudes were really optimizing kind of an dailyi basis. And between the WTI and the base crudes. So I don't think there's anything structurally in the market there, it's just part of the overall optimization."

Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included a net benefit of $0.44 per share, primarily related to a reversal of our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spreads, robust product demand entering the summer driving and asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of MarkWest in our consolidated results. 
The Refining & Marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable operating and market conditions during the quarter. Our integrated  7-refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials, as well as enhanced price realizations to our refined product distribution system.
Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize the operations even during this disruptions, such as those caused in the second quarter by the Canadian wildfires and refinery outages.
Speedway continued its outstanding performance with a record second quarter segment income. In addition, to higher light product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter.
This improvement is consistent with the strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We're pleased with our progress in realizing synergies across the Speedway network, earlier than originally planned and believe this will be a continuing source of value to the business.
Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPC's integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhance overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining, pipeline and terminal operations.
The Midstream segment including MPLX financial and operational results also delivered solid performance during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve it's 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional drop-downs from MPC during the year. 
During the quarter, MPLX expanded its Midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its Hidalgo gas processing complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations.
Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with completion expected in the fourth quarter. Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's Canton, Ohio refinery with a direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline to our Midwest refineries. 
As commodity prices recover -- excuse me, optimism is growing among MPLX's producer customers, and with world-class midstream assets located in some of the best resource plays in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain. 
As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have returned to more favorable levels, as the impact of the Canadian wildfires subsided.
Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expect good values throughout the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign sweet and sour cargoes. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enables us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest.
We also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year STAR program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the resid hydrocracker by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower value residual oil into gas oil. The EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year.
During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27 our Board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. That 29% compound annual growth rate in our dividends since MPC became an independent company, demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business.
It also demonstrates our long-term focus on capital returns, while maintaining an investment grade credit profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle.
The efficiency and flexibility of our integrated retail, logistics and refining systems drives the diversified earnings power of our business and we remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Tim?"

Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.",1397,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.44 per share net benefit in the quarter, which included the benefit of $0.47 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve, and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the impairment of 1 MPLX's equity investments.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower of cost or market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in the Refining & Marketing segment, and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment.
After adjusting for this benefit, earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our Refining & Marketing segment, higher interest expense resulting from the MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned.
This negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our midstream and Speedway segments and lower income taxes.
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LTM reversal was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast in Chicago and narrow LLS-WTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher cost related returner activity in the second quarter.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was an improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact in earnings of approximately $502 million, the blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year.
Other [ph] segment income benefited $227 million by an approximately $2 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher severance in the quarter versus last year The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. Which had a negative impact in earnings of about $100 million based on the WTI linked crudes in our 
slate.
The market structure contango effect during the quarter is reflected $78 million unfavorable variance on the walk and it relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter.
The $70 million increase year-over-year in direct operating costs relate primarily a higher turn around activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million compared to second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs, which was 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. 
Capture rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the effect of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrow crude differentials and tighter differentials on feedstocks relative to crude. 
Turning to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million, which was up to $66 million higher than the second quarter of 2015. 
Light product margin was a significant contributor to this increase, along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedways lower of cost or market inventory reserves in the quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher in the second quarter of last year, then in the second quarter of last year at $0.15.5 per gallon, while volumes were up $33 million-gallon quarter-over-quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased over 0.3% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes increased 2% out of same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making on enhancing our merchandise model across the entire business.
In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 1% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July.  Which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015.
Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Slide 8 provides the change in Midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents a significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of quarter was nearly $1.8 billion, core operating cash flow was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by smaller increases in accounts receivable. 
The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter, which led to the net source of cash given the generally longer-terms in the crude payables versus refined products.
As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. 
Proceeds from this private replacement have broken out separately in the walk. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver, which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included a repurchase of $51 million of worth of shares and $170 million of dividends. Share repurchase activity may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period.
Our commitment to continue to return the capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, which is higher approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time of the spend. 
In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per share dividend announced by our Board yesterday, represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spend.
Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. 
Total debt to book capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable to 2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion, which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter 2015 due to more plant maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items expected to be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa for questions."

How important having a diversified portfolio and a diversified value chain is to a business like ours. It is not only the most ratable customer within our portfolio, it's also this and our long-term strategy to grow the Midstream business as well as the retail business. Those 2 segments are becoming, I would say our most credible cash flow streams within the business. So yes, we are happy with the structure. But yes, we continue to analyze and annualize -- analyze very critically as you call it in arbitrage. But when you look at on arbitrage Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is. Now the integration value is, I would say proprietary. I can't give a out number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant. Especially when you look at downturn in the cycles. And as I've mentioned several times then you look again at first half of this year the EBITDA from Speedway, the first half of this year, clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital.

So that's sort of our primary focus to make sure that we sort of baselined the capital turnaround in attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle. Share purchase for us continues to be sort of a flywheel depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective, and so how we're viewing things. Obviously, we've taken down our capital spending plans in 2016. And I think some of the reductions that we've seen on the share purchase side has gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like. But I think it will continue to be an important source, and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position, we find ourselves in as we move forward.
So continued focus, I know the activity is lower in second quarter and in the first quarter than it's been over the last several years. But again, it's really just a function of what the liquidity needs of the business are at different points in time."

Especially if you look at the same period last year, when we were in a very strong refining market last year. But refiners ran full out and that tremendous build in excess inventories is what really led to the downturn in the fourth quarter and really first quarter this year because of the rapid build of inventories and the long-term to be able to run those off. When I look at the inventories, that came out yesterday Neil, in the pads where we predominantly operate, gasoline in PADD II is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year. And we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories, but Mike Palmer pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for PAD III and early into PAD IV, it appears to be a significant turnaround and schedule somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. And then, of course, we're going to switch to the winter grade gasoline before long. On distillates, both PADD II and PADD III we're fairly balanced on distillates. The way I look at across the chain or I should say across the industry. But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good results in the past that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause a degradation in margins into the future. But let's say, this looks pretty good shape right now, gasoline PADD II were in good shape, it's just PADD III gasoline is a bit high."

We're also looking at moving NGLs to the Gulf Coast and have been in regular discussion with our partner enterprise on Centennial and evaluating the feasibility of a reversal of Centennial. And then the third major project that we've been spending a lot of time on is a project to a butane to alkylate project that would likely be positioned somewhere near our processing facilities in the Utica, Marcellus. And that would allow us to convert butane to alkylate and allow our producer customers to see an uplift in their overall valuation. But that's a big project.

With the ARB coming in, we're also seeing some really good opportunities worldwide. We're bringing in more spot, sour cargoes than typically we have been able to find value in. And because Galveston Bay and Garyville have the ability to run the heavy, more difficult crude, high 10 crudes. That's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount.

And we've seen the Canadian spreads return back to normal. They look a lot more attractive to us than they did before. As you know, the Canadian heavy with these projects that were sanctioned prior to this fall in crude prices, those projects continue. So the Canadian heavy continues to grow. And we see a lot of value in the Canadian heavy."

Thank you for joining us. If you please turn to Slide 3.Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included a net benefit of $0.44 per share, primar",775,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you please turn to Slide 3.
Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included a net benefit of $0.44 per share, primarily related to a reversal of our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spreads, robust product demand entering the summer driving and asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of MarkWest in our consolidated results. 
The Refining & Marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable operating and market conditions during the quarter. Our integrated  7-refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials, as well as enhanced price realizations to our refined product distribution system.
Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize the operations even during this disruptions, such as those caused in the second quarter by the Canadian wildfires and refinery outages.
Speedway continued its outstanding performance with a record second quarter segment income. In addition, to higher light product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter.
This improvement is consistent with the strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We are pleased with our progress in realizing synergies across the Speedway network, earlier than originally planned and believe this will be a continuing source of value to the business.
Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPC's integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhance overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining, pipeline and terminal operations.
The Midstream segment including MPLX financial and operational results also delivered solid performance during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve it's 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional drop-downs from MPC during the year. 
During the quarter, MPLX expanded its Midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its Hidalgo gas processing complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations.
Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with completion expected in the fourth quarter. Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's Canton, Ohio refinery with a direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline to our Midwest refineries. 
As commodity prices recover -- excuse me, optimism is growing among MPLX's producer customers, and with world-class midstream assets located in some of the best resource plays in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain. 
As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have returned to more favorable levels, as the impact of the Canadian wildfires subsided.
Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expect good values throughout the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign sweet and sour cargoes. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enables us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest.
We also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year STAR program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the resid hydrocracker by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower value residual oil into gas oil. The EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year.
During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27 our Board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. That 29% compound annual growth rate in our dividends since MPC became an independent company, demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business.
It also demonstrates our long-term focus on capital returns, while maintaining an investment grade credit profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle.
The efficiency and flexibility of our integrated retail, logistics and refining systems drives the diversified earnings power of our business and we remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Tim?"
118315802,369774999,1015955,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.",1396,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.44 per share net benefit in the quarter, which included the benefit of $0.47 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve, and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the impairment of 1 MPLX's equity investments.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower of cost or market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in the Refining & Marketing segment, and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment.
After adjusting for this benefit, earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our Refining & Marketing segment, higher interest expense resulting from the MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned.
These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our midstream and Speedway segments and lower income taxes.
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LTM reversal was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast in Chicago and narrow LLS-WTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher cost related returner activity in the second quarter.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was an improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact in earnings of approximately $502 million, the blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year.
R&M segment income benefited $227 million by an approximately $2 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. Which had a negative impact in earnings of about $100 million based on the WTI linked crudes in our 
slate.
The market structure contango effect during the quarter is reflected $78 million unfavorable variance on the walk and it relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter.
The $70 million increase year-over-year in direct operating costs relate primarily a higher turn around activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million compared to second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs, which was 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. 
Capture rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the effect of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrow crude differentials and tighter differentials on feedstocks relative to crude. 
Turning to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million; which was up to $66 million higher than the second quarter of 2015. 
Light product margin was a significant contributor to this increase, along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedways lower of cost or market inventory reserves in the quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher in the second quarter of last year, then in the second quarter of last year at $0.15.5 per gallon, while volumes were up $33 million-gallon quarter-over-quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased over 0.3% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes increased 2% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making on enhancing our merchandise model across the entire business.
In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 1% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July.  Which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015.
Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Slide 8 provides the changes in Midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents a significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of quarter was nearly $1.8 billion, core operating cash flow was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by smaller increases in accounts receivable. 
The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter, which led to the net source of cash given the generally longer-terms in the crude payables versus refined products.
As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. 
Proceeds from this private replacement are broken out separately in the walk. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver, which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included a repurchase of $51 million of worth of shares and $170 million of dividends. Share repurchase activity may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period.
Our commitment to continue to return the capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, returning approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time of the spend. 
In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per share dividend announced by our Board yesterday, represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spend.
Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. 
Total debt to book capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable to 2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion, which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter 2015 due to more plan maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items expected to be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa for questions."

How important having a diversified portfolio and a diversified value chain is to a business like ours. It is not only the most ratable customer within our portfolio, it's also this and our long-term strategy to grow the Midstream business as well as the retail business. Those 2 segments are becoming, I would say our most ratable cash flow streams within the business. So yes, we are happy with the structure. But yes, we continue to analyze and annualize -- analyze very critically as you call it in arbitrage. But when you look at on arbitrage Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is. Now the integration value is, I would say proprietary. I can't give a out number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant. Especially when you look at downturns in the cycles. And as I've mentioned several times then you look again at first half of this year the EBITDA from Speedway, the first half of this year, clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital. So yes, we are happy. Yes, we continue to analyze it very carefully, but I would expect that we will continue on as we are."

So that's sort of our primary focus to make sure that we sort of baselined the capital turnaround in attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle. Share purchase for us continues to be sort of a flywheel depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective, and certainly how we're viewing things. Obviously, we've taken down our capital spending plans in 2016. And I think some of the reductions that we've seen on the share purchase side has gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like. But I think it will continue to be an important source, and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position, we find ourselves in as we move forward.
So continued focus, I know the activity is lower in second quarter and in the first quarter than it's been over the last several years. But again, it's really just a function of what the liquidity needs of the business are at different points in time."

Especially if you look at the same period last year, when we were in a very strong refining market last year. But refiners ran full out and that tremendous build in excess inventories is what really led to the downturn in the fourth quarter and early first quarter this year because of the rapid build of inventories and the long-term to be able to run those off. When I look at the inventories, that came out yesterday Neil, in the pads where we predominantly operate, gasoline in PADD II is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year. And we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories, but Mike Palmer pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for PAD III and early into PAD IV, it appears to be a significant turnaround and scheduled somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. And then, of course, we're going to switch to the winter grade gasoline before long. On distillates, both PADD II and PADD III we're fairly balanced on distillates. The way I look at across the chain or I should say across the industry. But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good resolve in the past that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause a degradation in margins into the future. But let's say, this looks pretty good shape right now, gasoline PADD II were in good shape, it's just PADD III gasoline is a bit high."

And then the other thing that we pointed out in the release this morning is we've indicated a double-digit growth in 2017, and we have not talked about that previously. So I think that with the increase we just had in MPLX, with the expectations of growth in 2017, with the success that we've had and what we believe we'll be growing volumes in our base business. And the other key to watch within MPLX, as well that is, if you look at our capacity utilization, as commodity prices improve, we have a tremendous amount of basically, free space to be able to fill up some of the capacity that we already have invested in, that will fall directly to the bottom line. So we're expecting that our yield is going to continue to improve with the solid performance again that we've had. Our balance sheets are in good order.

It's been the differential that they've been experiencing to like Mont Belvieu pricing. So very focused on moving NGLs to the East Coast, and I can say that project is probably the 1 that's furthest ahead in terms of a in-service date and getting a solution. We're also looking at moving NGLs to the Gulf Coast and have been in regular discussion with our partner enterprise on Centennial and evaluating the feasibility of a reversal of Centennial. And then the third major project that we've been spending a lot of time on is a project to a butane to alkylate project that would likely be positioned somewhere near our processing facilities in the Utica, Marcellus. And that would allow us to convert butane to alkylate and allow our producer customers to see an uplift in their overall valuation. But that's a big project.

So a lot of what -- and frankly, a lot of what was done from cash basis was done as really sort of a prefunding for capital spend. We would have expected MPLX over the course of the year. So that capital raise was less about trying to build into a big capital, a big cash position that could be spent and more about really taking care of the needs of the partnership over the back half of the year.

It's been pretty stable, we see that continuing, the sour crudes in the Gulf are still growing. And we see really good value there. With the ARB coming in, we're also seeing some really good opportunities worldwide. We're bringing in more spot, sour cargoes than typically we have been able to find value in. And because Galveston Bay and Garyville have the ability to run the heavy, more difficult crudes, high TAN crudes. That's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount. So we see that continuing to go forward.  In terms of the additional WTI kind of base crudes, that's going to shift back and forth depending on what's happening at the plants, what crudes were really optimizing kind of an daily basis.

Earnings included a net benefit of $0.44 per share, primar",775,"Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you please turn to Slide 3.
Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included a net benefit of $0.44 per share, primarily related to a reversal of our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spreads, robust product demand entering the summer driving and asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of MarkWest in our consolidated results. 
The Refining & Marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable operating and market conditions during the quarter. Our integrated  7-refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials, as well as enhanced price realizations to our refined product distribution system.
Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize the operations even during this disruptions, such as those caused in the second quarter by the Canadian wildfires and refinery outages.
Speedway continued its outstanding performance with a record second quarter segment income. In addition, to higher light product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter.
This improvement is consistent with the strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We are pleased with our progress in realizing synergies across the Speedway network, earlier than originally planned and believe this will be a continuing source of value to the business.
Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPC's integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhance overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining, pipeline and terminal operations.
The Midstream segment including MPLX financial and operational results also delivered solid performance during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve its 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional drop-downs from MPC during the year. 
During the quarter, MPLX expanded its Midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its Hidalgo gas processing complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations.
Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with completion expected in the fourth quarter. Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's Canton, Ohio refinery with a direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline to our Midwest refineries. 
As commodity prices recover -- excuse me, optimism is growing among MPLX's producer customers, and with world-class midstream assets located in some of the best resource plays in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain. 
As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have returned to more favorable levels, as the impact of the Canadian wildfires subsided.
Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expect good values throughout the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign sweet and sour cargoes. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enables us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest.
We also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year STAR program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the resid hydrocracker by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower value residual oil into gas oil. The EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year.
During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27 our Board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. That 29% compound annual growth rate in our dividends since MPC became an independent company, demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business.
It also demonstrates our long-term focus on capital returns, while maintaining an investment grade credit profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle.
The efficiency and flexibility of our integrated retail, logistics and refining systems drives the diversified earnings power of our business and we remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Tim?"

Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.",1396,"Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings in both on absolute and per share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. We refer to the $0.44 per share net benefit in the quarter, which included the benefit of $0.47 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve, and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the impairment of 1 MPLX's equity investments.
The chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower of cost or market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in the Refining & Marketing segment, and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment.
After adjusting for this benefit, earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our Refining & Marketing segment, higher interest expense resulting from the MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned.
These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our midstream and Speedway segments and lower income taxes.
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LTM reversal was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast in Chicago and narrow LLS-WTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher cost related returner activity in the second quarter.
Partially offsetting these negative impacts was an improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact in earnings of approximately $502 million, the blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year.
R&M segment income benefited $227 million by an approximately $2 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. Which had a negative impact in earnings of about $100 million based on the WTI linked crudes in our slate.
The market structure contango effect during the quarter is reflected $78 million unfavorable variance on the walk and it relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter.
The $70 million increase year-over-year in direct operating costs relate primarily a higher turn around activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million compared to second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs, which was 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. 
Capture rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the effect of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrow crude differentials and tighter differentials on feedstocks relative to crude. 
Turning to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million; which was up to $66 million higher than the second quarter of 2015. 
Light product margin was a significant contributor to this increase, along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedways lower of cost or market inventory reserves in the quarter.
Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher in the second quarter of last year, then in the second quarter of last year at $0.15.5 per gallon, while volumes were up $33 million-gallon quarter-over-quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased over 0.3% over the same period last year. 
Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes increased 2% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making on enhancing our merchandise model across the entire business.
In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 1% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July.  Which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015.
Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth, as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Slide 8 provides the changes in Midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year.
Slide 9 presents a significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of quarter was nearly $1.8 billion, core operating cash flow was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by smaller increases in accounts receivable. 
The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter, which led to the net source of cash given the generally longer-terms in the crude payables versus refined products.
As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. 
Proceeds from this private replacement are broken out separately in the walk. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver, which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included a repurchase of $51 million of worth of shares and $170 million of dividends. Share repurchase activity may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period.
Our commitment to continue to return the capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, returning approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time of the spend. 
In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per share dividend announced by our Board yesterday, represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spend.
Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. 
Total debt to book capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable to 2x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion, which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter.
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter 2015 due to more plant maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items expected to be about $75 million.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa for questions."

How important having a diversified portfolio and a diversified value chain is to a business like ours. It is not only the most ratable customer within our portfolio, it's also this and our long-term strategy to grow the Midstream business as well as the retail business. Those 2 segments are becoming, I would say our most ratable cash flow streams within the business. So yes, we are happy with the structure. But yes, we continue to analyze and annualize -- analyze very critically as you call it in arbitrage. But when you look at on arbitrage Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is. Now the integration value is, I would say proprietary. I can't give out a number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant. Especially when you look at downturns in the cycles. And as I've mentioned several times then you look again at first half of this year the EBITDA from Speedway, the first half of this year, clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital. So yes, we are happy. Yes, we continue to analyze it very carefully, but I would expect that we will continue on as we are."

So that's sort of our primary focus to make sure that we sort of baselined the capital turnaround in attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle. Share purchase for us continues to be sort of a flywheel depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective, and certainly how we're viewing things. Obviously, we've taken down our capital spending plans in 2016. And I think some of the reductions that we've seen on the share purchase side has gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like. But I think it will continue to be an important source, and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position, we find ourselves in as we move forward.
So continued focus, I know the activity is lower in second quarter and in the first quarter than it's been over the last several years. But again, it's really just a function of what the liquidity needs of the business are at different points in time."

Especially if you look at the same period last year, when we were in a very strong refining market last year. But refiners ran full out and that tremendous build in excess inventories is what really led to the downturn in the fourth quarter and early first quarter this year because of the rapid build of inventories and the long-term to be able to run those off. When I look at the inventories, that came out yesterday Neil, in the pads where we predominantly operate, gasoline in PADD II is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year. And we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories, but Mike Palmer pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for PAD III and early into PAD IV, it appears to be a significant turnaround and scheduled somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. And then, of course, we're going to switch to the winter grade gasoline before long. On distillates, both PADD II and PADD III we're fairly balanced on distillates. The way I look at across the chain or I should say across the industry. But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good resolve in the past that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause a degradation in margins into the future. But let's say, this looks pretty good shape right now, gasoline PADD II were in good shape, it's just PADD III gasoline is a bit high."

So I think we're sort of mindful that, the working capital benefit obviously is a big function of where absolute crude prices are at and how quickly they move. So a lot of what -- and frankly, a lot of what was done from cash basis was done as really sort of a prefunding for capital spend. We would have expected MPLX over the course of the year. So that capital raise was less about trying to build into a big capital, a big cash position that could be spent and more about really taking care of the needs of the partnership over the back half of the year. We did pay down some of the debt again and just opened up some capacity. But it's really I would say most of the proceeds that were brought in are sort of spoken for it at this point.

We're finding a lot of opportunities in sour crude right now. Not only in the Gulf of Mexico, where if you look at those spreads over the last 6 months, Mars has been discounted to LLS in the range of $5 to $6. It's been pretty stable, we see that continuing, the sour crudes in the Gulf are still growing. And we see really good value there. With the ARB coming in, we're also seeing some really good opportunities worldwide. We're bringing in more spot, sour cargoes than typically we have been able to find value in. And because Galveston Bay and Garyville have the ability to run the heavy, more difficult crudes, high TAN crudes. That's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount. So we see that continuing to go forward.  In terms of the additional WTI kind of base crudes, that's going to shift back and forth depending on what's happening at the plants, what crudes were really optimizing kind of an daily basis. And between the WTI and the LLS base crudes. So I don't think there's anything structural in the market there. It's just part of the overall optimization."

Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million",1249,"[Audio Gap]
These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our Midstream segment. 
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago, and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year.
There were 4 primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin brands in this walk. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the reported market metric LLS base crack spread in the third quarter of '16 compared to the same quarter last year. Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which include the asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015, and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude. Third, as I mentioned, we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time, our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our cost of purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter. Finally, refinery volume metric gains also continue to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher severance in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of '15 to a $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter.
This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The market structure or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter. The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating cost relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.37 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which is a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016.
Partially offsetting lower fuel margins, were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandised margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year. Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Increasing merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandised gross margin compared to third quarter of 2015.
Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales as well as higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, is approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew on approximately 500 Speedway locations.
Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed a $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter.
The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus the third quarter last year. 
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined products inventory levels during the quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the walk.
MPLX opportunistically issued equity through its ATM program during the quarter with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchase of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We have increased our dividend 6 times since becoming a standalone company 5 years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 34%, and represented 2.3x last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8x if we exclude MPLX. We're showing the metric without MPLX since the debt is nonrecourse MPC and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage, making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful given the size and continued growth of the partnership. 
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating cost is expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter, we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter due to the continued sour crude advantage.
Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $75 million.

It's not just a drop-down strategy Neil, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the Midstream as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on. But as we step back and looked at our total Midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this very bold, aggressive action. And then -- we have also stated, not just the drop-downs for 2017, of approximately $350 million, but we're also then are talking about the future drop-down strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets. Let me be specific about that $1 billion of other assets. As you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece, that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS. So we have to be careful and make sure we don't have any potential tax liability of dropping those down sooner than -- that we would believe we have approval from the IRS.

So again, I would say that we really want to look at everything. There is no preconceived notion or conclusions as to where ultimately this may lead us. Again with that objective of highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDR's at the partnership level, public sale of some portion of the GP, other alternatives around restructuring the GP interest. Again, we want to make sure that we're going to look at everything and make sure that we understand what might be the best path to really have that value better reflected in the overall valuation of MPC."

I want to make sure that's going to be a recurring advantage for MPC on a go-forward basis."

And when you have that, you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year. This year, when we started to see a steady climb in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, you have to look at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets, such has happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn, and in fact it backed product, back into the Gulf Coast, and in fact, backed products for the West. On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was a phenomena, but it really -- Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices -- the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that was held as well. So I would say, those are the big things. I would say they are non -- expect them to be nonrecurring, kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast, some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter. That had an effect as well. When you lose that volume from these tropical storms, it's gone. So all those effects -- all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter, but I would expect that they would be nonrecurring."

And we'll continue to progress our engineering and just do really what makes sense there. I might add at this point that the STAR program really is a multi-year, multifaceted project.

I mean, $1.4 times 9 is $12 billion before tax, before considering any GP potential monetization proceeds, which dwarf any capitalized cost referenced earlier today. I mean, shouldn't we assume that most of that's going to support a buyback. I mean, given your history, given your impetus for announcing today's actions that your equity is undervalued? And secondly, if drops are on the come, would you buy shares, use the balance sheet before they occur, like in the 4Q, I mean, your stock is down 5% today. And I know you didn't acquire much in the third quarter. And with that size of monetization, you have a lot of shares to put away potentially."

Share purchase continues to be a priority for us in terms of where that money gets spent. Again, our focus is I think primarily and starts with the notion that the value hasn't been recognized. So we want to make sure that, that value recognition occurs, and to the extent that produces cash at MPC level, that can be used for share buyback, all the better. Again, provided that we've done that tax efficiently and managed it relative to the total needs of the enterprise. But I think the notion that a substantial portion could take the form of share purchase is not unreasonable."

I mean, so is the limiting factor on the pace that you selected here, the capital markets, the equity capital markets for MPLX. So meaning, your actual drop-down pace could be faster if access or market depth or counterparty side proves to be greater? And secondly, that your goal is really to sell units for cash, right, because that's what compresses your multiple, and that's ultimately in my opinion what forces an unlock of value versus potentially taking back units.

But again, Evan, this is really a look as to -- obviously there's a piece of the drop-down portfolio that we're just not going to get comfortable with until we can get through the QI regs and a PLR round.  So let's set those aside for a moment. The remaining piece, we're moving pretty aggressively here. We are talking about dropping down up to half of those and setting a schedule for the remaining pieces, again, provided that we can get tax comfort on the rest at a pretty good clip. I think the considerations around it, it certainly involved market capacity to absorb larger transaction, but also just in terms of the pace and the capacity to manage the growth of the partnership and making sure that we can optimize that total sort of equation with regard to how fast we build the partnership at the LP level and ultimately the cash flow that comes to the GP as well. So again, I think we are moving very aggressively here. I think we're -- there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all, from my perspective, likely going to be part of MPLX and we're moving very rapidly on it. So I think this is an aggressive schedule. I mean, even the drop that we've suggested for first quarter would the largest transaction for MPLX in its history. And again, we recognize that, that value is not getting picked up and this increased clarity on the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think that help address that valuation gap."

At the time that we did MarkWest, we stated that we looked out into the future and could easily see that the rate of drop-downs from a sponsored MLP was not infinite. And as you get out over time, it was going to be much more difficult, and at that same time, the pressure from others in the marketplace of attempting to be able to find growth opportunities was going to continue to be challenging. That's why we did the merger with MarkWest to begin with. We've been very pleased with the assets. Don has talked about the rate of growth, the volumetric increases and the gathering and processing business is very solid as well as the logistics, the storage business that we have as well. But still, we were not seeing that value transferred in the yield component of MPLX.

Today you have a, I don't know, probably the number is less than 50 of refiners and big blenders who are managing, really step back and look at this.

lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our Midstream segment. 
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago, and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at 808 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year.
There were 4 primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin brands in this walk. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the reported market metric LLS base crack spread in the third quarter of '16 compared to the same quarter last year. Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which include the asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015, and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude. Third, as I mentioned, we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time, our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our cost of purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter. Finally, refinery volume metric gains also continue to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher severance in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of '15 to a $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter.
This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The market structure or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter. The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating cost relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.37 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which is a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016.
Partially offsetting lower fuel margins, were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandised margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year. Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Increasing merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandised gross margin compared to third quarter of 2015.
Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales as well as higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, is approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew on approximately 500 Speedway locations.
Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed a $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter.
The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus the third quarter last year. 
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined products inventory levels during the quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the walk.
MPLX opportunistically issued equity through it's ATM program during the quarter with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchase of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We have increased our dividend 6 times since becoming a standalone company 5 years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 34%, and represented 2.3x last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8x if we exclude MPLX. We're showing the metric without MPLX since the debt is nonrecourse MPC and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage, making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful given the size and continued growth of the partnership. 
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating cost is expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter, we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter due to the continued sour crude advantage.
Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $75 million.

It's not just a drop-down strategy Niel, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the Midstream as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on. But as we step back and looked at our total Midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this very bold, aggressive action. And then -- we have also stated, not just the drop-downs for 2017, of approximately $350 million, but we're also then are talking about the future drop-down strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets. Let me be specific about that $1 billion of other assets. As you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece, that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS.

Let's go back and look at the third quarter of '16 versus the third quarter of '15. Third quarter of '15 had a rapid drop in the price of crude. And when you have that, you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year. This year, when we started to see a steady climb in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, [indiscernible] at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets, such has happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn, and in fact it backed product, back into the Gulf Coast, and in fact, backed products for the West. On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was a phenomena, but it really -- Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices -- the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that was held as well. So I would say, those are the big things. I would say they are non -- expect them to be nonrecurring, kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast, some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter. That had an affect as well. When you lose that volume from these tropical storms, it's gone. So all those effects -- all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter, but I would expect that they would be nonrecurring."

So again, I think we are moving very aggressively here. I think we're -- there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all, from my perspective, likely going to be part of MPLX and we're moving very rapidly on it. So I think this is an aggressive schedule. I mean, even the drop that we've suggested for first quarter would the largest transaction for MPLX in its history. And again, we recognize that, that value is not getting picked up and this increased clarity on the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think that help address that valuation gap."

[Audio Gap]
These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our Midstream segment. 
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago, and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year.
There were 4 primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin brands in this walk. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the reported market metric LLS base crack spread in the third quarter of '16 compared to the same quarter last year. Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which include the asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015, and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude. Third, as I mentioned, we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time, our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our cost to purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter. Finally, refinery volume metric gains also continue to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of '15 to a $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter.
This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The market structure or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter. The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating cost relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.037 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which is a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016.
Partially offsetting lower fuel margins, were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandised margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year. Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Increasing merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandised gross margin compared to third quarter of 2015.
Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales as well as higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, is approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew on approximately 500 Speedway locations.
Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed a $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter.
The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus the third quarter last year. 
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined products inventory levels during the quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the walk.
MPLX opportunistically issued equity through its ATM program during the quarter with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchase of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We have increased our dividend 6 times since becoming a standalone company 5 years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 34%, and represented 2.3x last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8x if we exclude MPLX. We're showing the metric without MPLX since the debt is nonrecourse MPC and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage, making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful given the size and continued growth of the partnership. 
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating cost is expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter, we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter due to the continued sour crude advantage.
Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $75 million.

As we -- in our separate release this morning, we have been working on this for quite some time on -- we spent the early part of the year in the transition to get MarkWest into the fold and to really get our businesses lined out. And then, really focused on what is the proper growth strategy and how do we -- we have tremendous portfolio of assets that can be considered over time to be drop-down. And we felt that it was the best to get into a very aggressive strong rhythm on how to drop-down the assets that we have. It's not just a drop-down strategy Neil, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the Midstream as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on. But as we step back and looked at our total Midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this very bold, aggressive action. And then -- we have also stated, not just the drop-downs for 2017, of approximately $350 million, but we're also then are talking about the future drop-down strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets. Let me be specific about that $1 billion of other assets. As you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece, that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS. So we have to be careful and make sure we don't have any potential tax liability of dropping those down sooner than -- that we would believe we have approval from the IRS. An additional thing that we highlighted, the value of the general partner interest, let me have Tim talk about some of the actions and the aspects that we would have around looking at the general partner interest."

So I think we want to take a careful but aggressive look at exactly ways that we can highlight that value, capture it and optimize the cost to capital for the partnership. So again, I would say that we really want to look at everything. There is no preconceived notion or conclusions as to where ultimately this may lead us. Again with that objective of highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDR's at the partnership level, public sale of some portion of the GP, other alternatives around restructuring the GP interest. Again, we want to make sure that we're going to look at everything and make sure that we understand what might be the best path to really have that value better reflected in the overall valuation of MPC."

And I guess, the reason I'm going here is that, when I think about MPC's portfolio, historically, you guys have outperformed your indicator margins by taking advantage of the logistics in the infrastructure advantages that you guys have.

Let's go back and look at the third quarter of '16 versus the third quarter of '15. Third quarter of '15 had a rapid drop in the price of crude. And when you have that, you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year. This year, when we started to see a steady climb in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, you go back and look at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets, such has happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn, and in fact it backed product, back into the Gulf Coast, and in fact, backed products for the West. On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was a phenomena, but it really -- Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices -- the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that was held as well. So I would say, those are the big things. I would say they are non -- expect them to be nonrecurring, kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast, some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter. That had an effect as well. When you lose that volume from these tropical storms, it's gone. So all those effects -- all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter, but I would expect that they would be nonrecurring."

And we'll continue to progress our engineering and just do really what makes sense there. I might add at this point that the STAR program really is a multi-year, multifaceted project. And earlier this summer, we brought on the first pay part, which was a desulfurization unit, repurposing and expansion, and that's played out very well for us.

And secondly, if drops are on the come, would you buy shares, use the balance sheet before they occur, like in the 4Q, I mean, your stock is down 5% today.

Again, provided that we've done that tax efficiently and managed it relative to the total needs of the enterprise.

So meaning, your actual drop-down pace could be faster if access or market depth or counterparty side proves to be greater? And secondly, that your goal is really to sell units for cash, right, because that's what compresses your multiple, and that's ultimately in my opinion what forces an unlock of value versus potentially taking back units.

But again, Evan, this is really a look as to -- obviously there's a piece of the drop-down portfolio that we're just not going to get comfortable with until we can get through the QI regs and a PLR round.  So let's set those aside for a moment. The remaining piece, we're moving pretty aggressively here. We are talking about dropping down up to half of those and setting a schedule for the remaining pieces, again, provided that we can get tax comfort on the rest at a pretty good clip. I think the considerations around it, it certainly involved market capacity to absorb larger transaction, but also just in terms of the pace and the capacity to manage the growth of the partnership and making sure that we can optimize that total sort of equation with regard to how fast we build the partnership at the LP level and ultimately the cash flow that comes to the GP as well. So again, I think we are moving very aggressively here. I think we're -- there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all, from my perspective, likely going to be part of MPLX and we're moving very rapidly on it. So I think this is an aggressive schedule. I mean, even the drop that we've suggested for first quarter would be the largest transaction for MPLX in its history. And again, we recognize that, that value is not getting picked up and this increased clarity on the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think that help address that valuation gap."

At the time that we did MarkWest, we stated that we looked out into the future and could easily see that the rate of drop-downs from a sponsored MLP was not infinite. And as you get out over time, it was going to be much more difficult, and at that same time, the pressure from others in the marketplace of attempting to be able to find growth opportunities was going to continue to be challenging. That's why we did the merger with MarkWest to begin with. We've been very pleased with the assets. Don has talked about the rate of growth, the volumetric increases and the gathering and processing business is very solid as well as the logistics, the storage business that we have as well.

[Audio Gap]
These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our Midstream segment. 
Turning to Slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter 2016, compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago, and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year.
There were 4 primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin brands in this walk. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the reported market metric LLS base crack spread in the third quarter of '16 compared to the same quarter last year. Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which include the asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015, and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude. Third, as I mentioned, we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time, our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Our cost to purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter. Finally, refinery volume metric gains also continue to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of '15 to a $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter.
This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The market structure or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost in the quarter. The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating cost relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Moving to our other segments. Slide 7 provides the Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.037 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which is a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016.
Partially offsetting lower fuel margins, were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandised margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year. Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.
Increasing merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandised gross margin compared to third quarter of 2015.
Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales as well as higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, is approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew on approximately 500 Speedway locations.
Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed a $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter.
The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus the third quarter last year. 
Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined products inventory levels during the quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the walk.
MPLX opportunistically issued equity through its ATM program during the quarter with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchase of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We have increased our dividend 6 times since becoming a standalone company 5 years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 34%, and represented 2.3x last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8x if we exclude MPLX. We're showing the metric without MPLX since the debt is nonrecourse MPC and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage, making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful given the size and continued growth of the partnership. 
Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating cost is expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter, we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter due to the continued sour crude advantage.
Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $75 million.

And we felt that it was the best to get into a very aggressive strong rhythm on how to drop-down the assets that we have. It's not just a drop-down strategy Neil, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the Midstream as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on. But as we step back and looked at our total Midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this very bold, aggressive action. And then -- we have also stated, not just the drop-downs for 2017, of approximately $350 million, but we're also then are talking about the future drop-down strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets. Let me be specific about that $1 billion of other assets. As you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece, that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS. So we have to be careful and make sure we don't have any potential tax liability of dropping those down sooner than -- that we would believe we have approval from the IRS. An additional thing that we highlighted, the value of the general partner interest, let me have Tim talk about some of the actions and the aspects that we would have around looking at the general partner interest."

So again, I would say that we really want to look at everything. There is no preconceived notion or conclusions as to where ultimately this may lead us. Again with that objective of highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDR's at the partnership level, public sale of some portion of the GP, other alternatives around restructuring the GP interest. Again, we want to make sure that we're going to look at everything and make sure that we understand what might be the best path to really have that value better reflected in the overall valuation of MPC."

And I guess, the reason I'm going here is that, when I think about MPC's portfolio, historically, you guys have outperformed your indicator margins by taking advantage of the logistics in the infrastructure advantages that you guys have. I want to make sure that's going to be a recurring advantage for MPC on a go-forward basis."

Let's go back and look at the third quarter of '16 versus the third quarter of '15. Third quarter of '15 had a rapid drop in the price of crude. And when you have that, you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year. This year, when we started to see a steady climb in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, you go back and look at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets, such has happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn, and in fact it backed product, back into the Gulf Coast, and in fact, backed products for the West. On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was a phenomena, but it really -- Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices -- the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that was held as well. So I would say, those are the big things. I would say they are non -- expect them to be nonrecurring, kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast, some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter. That had an effect as well. When you lose that volume from these tropical storms, it's gone. So all those effects -- all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter, but I would expect that they would be nonrecurring."

I mean, shouldn't we assume that most of that's going to support a buyback. I mean, given your history, given your impetus for announcing today's actions that your equity is undervalued? And secondly, if drops are on the come, would you buy shares, use the balance sheet before they occur, like in the 4Q, I mean, your stock is down 5% today.

But you mentioned dropping as soon as practicable, and then you drop, I know you defined drops per year. I mean, so is the limiting factor on the pace that you selected here, the capital markets, the equity capital markets for MPLX. So meaning, your actual drop-down pace could be faster if access or market depth or counterparty side proves to be greater? And secondly, that your goal is really to sell units for cash, right, because that's what compresses your multiple, and that's ultimately in my opinion what forces an unlock of value versus potentially taking back units. So what's the limiting factor -- what is the limiting factor to the pace, and I guess, as your goal to optimize those -- the equity?"

But again, Evan, this is really a look as to -- obviously there's a piece of the drop-down portfolio that we're just not going to get comfortable with until we can get through the QI regs and a PLR round.  So let's set those aside for a moment. The remaining piece, we're moving pretty aggressively here. We are talking about dropping down up to half of those and setting a schedule for the remaining pieces, again, provided that we can get tax comfort on the rest at a pretty good clip. I think the considerations around it, it certainly involved market capacity to absorb larger transaction, but also just in terms of the pace and the capacity to manage the growth of the partnership and making sure that we can optimize that total sort of equation with regard to how fast we build the partnership at the LP level and ultimately the cash flow that comes to the GP as well. So again, I think we are moving very aggressively here. I think we're -- there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all, from my perspective, likely going to be part of MPLX and we're moving very rapidly on it. So I think this is an aggressive schedule. I mean, even the drop that we've suggested for first quarter would be the largest transaction for MPLX in its history. And again, we recognize that, that value is not getting picked up and this increased clarity on the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think that help address that valuation gap."

At the time that we did MarkWest, we stated that we looked out into the future and could easily see that the rate of drop-downs from a sponsored MLP was not infinite.

That's why we did the merger with MarkWest to begin with. We've been very pleased with the assets. Don has talked about the rate of growth, the volumetric increases and the gathering and processing business is very solid as well as the logistics, the storage business that we have as well.

We have the optionality, the flexibility and with our retail component, our branded component and our very large blending component as well as some methanol production capacity, we have the ability to capture RIN value, and probably more so to lessen the cost of RIN value across all those different components of our business. To change, the point of obligation, we think that is fraught with many ramifications. Today you have a, I don't know, probably the number is less than 50 of refiners and big blenders who are managing, really step back and look at this. We're managing the whole RIN cycle for the EPA today. If we're going to go put this into the hands of 150,000 people, just consider what those ramifications are. We believe the RIN cost is captured in part of the crack spread today. And part of it is in retail, part of it is in blending. So we just think that changing the point of obligation is a bigger distraction."
