Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share.",1090,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. 
Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. 
I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter. Overall, our institutional business saw strong improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Investment Banking and our Private Bank, as well a across our equities and Fixed Income businesses. 
In consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking. 
In internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales, contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans and card purchase sales and credit continue to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios. 
We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter, largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016. 
Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets. 
Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs, and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet. 
We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis. 
I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last 3 years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, a Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity. 
At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets. While at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012. Excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers. 
Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup and we reached 11%, excluding the capital, which supports our disallowed DTA. 
In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate returns our shareholders expect and deserve. And as an example, we've exited or in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. 
We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven and now consist of only 4% of our balance sheet. And not only as holdings break it -- broken even, it's been profitable for 6 straight quarters. 
Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over 1/3. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mind the efficiencies in the opportunities in our business model. 
The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In an our institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains. 
In global consumer, we've reduced our branch footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest-growing Citi while investing in our mobile channels. 
We've simplified our branded cards portfolio, reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year. 
Our customer satisfaction is measured by Net Promoter Scores has improved meaningfully. 
We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings. We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012, we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last 3 years. This contributed to the generation of the $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last 3 years. 
Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders and we reduced our outstanding common shares by over $70 million and increased our common dividend. 
We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope. 
We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions, which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. 
Every day, we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. While as the early days of 2016 have shown the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging. 
And while there are bright spots such as the U.S, Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors whether they be the price of oil or interest rates difficult to predict. 
Volatility may present some trading opportunities, but more often, keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment. 
As I discussed earlier, we worked hard to transform our company and the changes we've made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower return consumer markets. We run a very balanced and tightly risk managed loan book. We become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients. And our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry. 
John will now go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Jon?"

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. On",3215,"Hey. Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales and Citi Holdings as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. 
In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. 
Expenses declined 23% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges as well as the benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter, largely in Citicorp, compared to a net release in the prior year. 
On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup, including Citi Holdings, was 57.3%. Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. 
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion. 
On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. 
In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year, driven by growth across our institutional franchise. 
Citicorp expenses declined 24%, reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net reserve build. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. We accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets, driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of year with $74 billion of assets. 
We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion [ph] of outstanding debt, and we position Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. 
The net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we had previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. 
While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves. 
On Slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth, to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs. 
And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3% while core operating expenses grew only 2%, and our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points. 
As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise. 
Turning to each business. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. 
In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. 
Card purchase sales continued to grow, up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America, driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio. 
We expect the cards payment rates in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact, however, with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates in ongoing regulatory pressures in cards. 
We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remain fairly stable sequentially and we continue to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region. 
And in retail banking, we continue to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues. 
In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 5%. 
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. 
In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets. However, we did see an uptick in net credit losses in certain markets in our commercial business, which serves small and mid-sized companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized. 
Slide 8 show the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year, including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. 
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. 
We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total U.S. branded card loans. 
And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio. 
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues declined 1% from last year, mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales. 
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6%, driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. 
As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our 6 key markets, where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in consumer behavior in digital channels. 
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter, with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points, respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an uptick in the NCL rate to 4.8%. But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio, including losses on a wind down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves. 
Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America, driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region. 
Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer Banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking in 2015 was nearly 54% of above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower-than-expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year, with broad-based growth across the franchise. 
Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by growth in high-quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. 
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year. While our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity. Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year, with share gains across debt and loan origination, and M&A revenues grow 15%. Private Bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And Corporate Lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. 
In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. 
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty. 
Turning to equities. Revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Securities Services, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. 
Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. 
Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy-related. 
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about 2/3 of which was offset by related reserve releases. 
Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy-related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time. And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio, about half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly a quarter was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was dispersed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration. 
With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015, or in other words, credit cost of roughly $600 million in total for the first half. 
Taking a step back and looking at the full year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In Fixed Income, despite the volatile backdrop, our rates and currencies revenue grew 4% over the prior year, with momentum in both local markets and G10 products. Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015, generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. 
In equities, we grew 13% [ph] year-over-year, with revenues approaching our near-term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter. 
M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid to high single-digit revenue growth across TTS, Securities Services and the Private Bank. 
So while we face certain industry-wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continue to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015. 
On Slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower-than-anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014. 
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year due in part to gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year-end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than 1/3 of this year-end amount relating to operational risk. 
As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and will continue to pursue other sales as well. 
On Slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sale as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges and other episodic items. 
As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. 
We currently expect the benefits of lower funding cost, the exit of loss-making portfolio and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain. 
As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016 and the asset should continue to come down as well with the corresponding benefit to RWA. 
On Slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated, due mostly to trading net interest margin. And our net interest margin for the full year was 293 basis points. 
Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings, partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquired the Costco portfolio, which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter. 
We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. 
Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016 and then it will reflect Costco in the second half. 
On Slide 17, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. 
Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. 
And importantly, within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. 
Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1% and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share. 
To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult, with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and the slow trajectory for U.S. rate increases. But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp while staying disciplined around our target client strategy. 
We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity and capture the benefits of scale. 
However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise. 
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in U.S. cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in ANR and branded cards, which, as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016; the completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition, for which we are already ramping up operations, but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around midyear; and finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment. 
Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near-term drag on our results. 
We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses, combined with certain other actions, will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year before improving in 2017 and thereafter. 
Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit cost to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now, but the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. 
Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

We've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce one was wind down holdings and then as we've always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients. And as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient, and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got -- I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in our -- in their nonoperating deposits. We came into the year with less than $100 billion of nonoperating deposits and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of nonoperating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of nonoperating deposits because they're not there. As far as from a adjacent point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory. In 2014 when the topic of first came out, we -- our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket. However, the continued efforts that I've just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet, resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year-end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers. So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our level 3 assets by 21%. And as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%. Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized, such as our cross jurisdictional claims and liabilities. So I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly, our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact."

Russia, obviously, as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last -- well, anyway, several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 [ph] years. And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times, but the portfolio in general has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's, by and large, seeing that you'll hear as I talked about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble. Does it mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it's a -- it produces a very resilient book of business. So in Russia, it's a little bit of just -- there's less business there. We're carefully managing credit lines and really nothing more than that. With Brazil, there's certainly -- that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down, of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil. You'll recall that I mentioned the uptick in Latin America, NCL in the fourth quarter. Largest part of that uptick is related to some losses that we took in the CCB, in our commercial business, and that is really centralized in Brazil and it's this portfolio, we're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases. And again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil."

So you heard us on this call for quite a while, talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening, branch closures, tighter target market in Korea. In Russia's case, there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs in the other as an after of that. And so you had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans, your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink. But at the same time, as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending distance to naturally slow as part of those icons. And as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see. And in the case of Brazil, in some ways, a combination of those, restructuring of what's going on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our credit card business, which was the mass merchant card business, which didn't fit, which in hindsight was a terrific sale and just staying discipline around those things. So I think it's part of our natural credit business process."

What I mentioned earlier -- I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit, but we also saw slight uptick in Asia. You'll see that the uptick guidance from 79 bps to 84 bps, but it was there. And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio, certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs, but most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps in GDP concerns coming out of China. So it's -- but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices, in particular, are a benefit to customers on a broader scale, probably, than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that. Now obviously, if the economies go south due to the fact that -- and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow-on in the consumer portfolios, but we don't see that today. And as I've mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market, given our focus on higher quality segments and which we think is really the right strategy for us. So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy. We took actions earlier on. Mike mentioned the sale of the credit card portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped about portfolio in India, in Mexico, in Korea. And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia that while it dampen our revenue prospects from time to time, they actually form a pretty good bases for a solid credit story. And if you think about Asia, Asia accounts for 70% of our total international consumer portfolio. And we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points. And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of our originations are the borrowers that would be comparable to 700-plus FICO scores in the U.S. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher-quality segments. I've mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstands have gotten updated LTV of less than 50% and our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to 0. So again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go on Latin America, Mexico is by far in a way the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass-market borrowers in Mexico, it's -- the credit story has really improved because we really, again, tightened that the focus to a much lower client segment over the years. So again, pretty good."

Well, we moved a couple of large -- about $8 billion [ph] of loans into held-for-sale. We expect it will be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale, I have to run through my loan loss reserve.

But don't forget what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA, and so that will -- especially when you think about the impact of our available-for-sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just with nearly at timing difference. The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time -- a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that. And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. The -- probably -- maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we for utilize the $1.9 billion of FTC that we have come into the year that was going to expire in 2017, but we also utilized $1.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well and that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective by utilized FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have our near-term expiration date.

Metals and mining is part of a larger sector that we report. But when you think about the metals and mining, our exposure overall to metals and mining is about $14 billion, and that includes about $5.6 billion worth of funded loans.

And I think I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of Slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, at some ways, quite informative. We'd talk a little bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier in the diversifications there and the mix between North America and internationally. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transitioned to Page 30 and actually look at the balance, look at the balance of our portfolio, it's the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition. And so when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM. We're actually over 1/3 of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions base. So in the Treasury space, the very short-term nature, they're largely to multinationals. And the trade solution space, they're allegedly collateralize. So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all the disclosures and gifts, $1 of loan can take on or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings. And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually, $49 billion is in Corporate Lending and John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality that books looks like. 37% or $42 billion of that is in short-term collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that?"

When we take a look -- the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world and it's focused on those large multinationals and some very tough tier large local corporates. And overall portfolio has got -- it's over 80% investment-grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio. You mentioned China, though. So let me -- you mentioned China, let me try to build up of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do, Mike, in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we got lending exposure. I mean, put that it's on Page 91 of our September 30 10-Q and we'll update that when we file our 10-K. And if you take a look at Page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion [ph] of aggregate exposure to China and then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities. And you'll see that as of September 30, those 2 amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with severance. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereigh security in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we updated this page in the 10-K. When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion [ph] and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia. Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high quality mortgage portfolio. Now the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia, in aggregate, has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high cycle equivalent, 700 plus. That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans. Same thing, very high cycle equivalent in excess of 700 and very good loss performance. And then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here, this portfolio has been broadly stable. So that leaves me with the last category that we give you, which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion and the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio, as Mike talked about the way it works around the road, it works the same way in China. More than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans, which are generally short term, secured financing or they're in the Private Bank. So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional Corporate Lending book. And over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinational domiciled outside of China or to large state-owned Chinese companies. So as you would expect with the portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment-grade."

And so from an international -- overall international consumer point of view, I'd expect as we continue to make investments in selected growth investments, whether it's technology or I mentioned digital and infrastructure, I'd say that we're going to pace the revenue that against the revenue growth.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'",1085,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter. 
Overall, our institutional businesses saw strong improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Investment Banking and our Private Bank as well as across our equities and Fixed Income businesses. 
In consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking. 
And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales, contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans and card purchase sales, and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios. 
We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter, largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016. Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets. 
Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs, and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet. We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis. 
I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last 3 years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity. At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets. While at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target, and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012, excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers. 
Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup; and we reached 11%, excluding the capital, which supports our disallowed DTA. 
In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve. And as an example, we've exited or in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven. It now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet. And not only is Holdings break -- broken even. It's been profitable for 6 straight quarters. 
Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over 1/3. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model. 
The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains. 
In global consumer, we've reduced our branch footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest-growing cities while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio, reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year. 
Our customer satisfaction, as measured by Net Promoter Scores, has improved meaningfully. 
We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings. We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012, we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last 3 years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last 3 years. Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders, and we reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend. 
We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope. We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions, which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. 
Every day, we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. While as the early days of 2016 have shown the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging and while there are bright spots such as the U.S., Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict. Volatility may present some trading opportunities, but more often, keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment. 
As I discussed earlier, we worked hard to transform our company, and the changes we'd made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower-return consumer markets. We run a very balanced and tightly risk-managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients, and our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry. 
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

On",3210,"Hey. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3. We highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. 
Expenses declined 23% year-over-year, driven by lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter, largely in Citicorp, compared to a net release in the prior year. 
On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup, including Citi Holdings, was 57.3%. Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 4% to $908 billion. 
On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year, driven by growth across our institutional franchise. 
Citicorp expenses declined 24%, reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net reserve build. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. We accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets, driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets. 
We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt, and we positioned Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. 
The net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we had previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. 
While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves. 
On Slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth, to deliver a modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs. 
And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3%, while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points. As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise. 
Turning to each business. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. 
In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow, up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America, driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio. We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact, however, with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates in ongoing regulatory pressures in cards. We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remain fairly stable sequentially, and we continue to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region. 
And in retail banking, we continue to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues. In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5%, and average deposits grew 5%. 
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain onetime items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. 
In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets. However, we did see an uptick in net credit losses in certain markets in our commercial business, which serves small- and mid-sized companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year, including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. 
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total U.S.-branded card loans. And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio. 
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues declined 1% from last year, mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6%, driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. 
As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our 6 key markets, where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in consumer behavior in digital channels. 
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter, with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points, respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an uptick in the NCL rate to 4.8%. But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio, including losses on a wind-down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves. Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America, driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region. 
Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer Banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower-than-expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year, with broad-based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by growth in high-quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. 
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year. While our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity. Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year, with share gains across debt and loan origination, and M&A revenues grew 15%. Private Bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And Corporate Lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. 
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty. 
Turning to equities. Revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Securities Services, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. 
Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. 
Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy-related. 
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about 2/3 of which was offset by related reserve releases. Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy-related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time. And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio, about half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly 1/4 was related to nonenergy credits in Brazil and the remainder was dispersed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration. 
With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or, in other words, credit cost of roughly $600 million in total for the first half. 
Taking a step back and looking at the full year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In Fixed Income, despite the volatile backdrop, our rates and currencies revenue grew 4% over the prior year, with momentum in both local markets and G10 products. Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015, generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. 
In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year, with revenues approaching our near-term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter. 
M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid- to high single-digit revenue growth across TTS, Securities Services and the Private Bank. 
So while we face certain industry-wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continue to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015. 
On Slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower-than-anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014. 
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year, due in part to gains on debt buybacks; and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year-end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than 1/3 of this year-end amount relating to operational risk. As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and will continue to pursue other sales as well. 
On Slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges and other episodic items. 
As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. 
We currently expect the benefits of lower funding cost, the exit of loss-making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain. As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the asset should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA. 
On Slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated, due mostly to trading net interest margin. And our net interest margin for the full year was 293 basis points. 
Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings, partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks, for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio, which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter. We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. 
Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016, and then it will reflect Costco in the second half. 
On Slide 17, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. 
Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. And importantly, within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. 
Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1%, and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share. 
To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult, with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and the slow trajectory for U.S. rate increases. But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp while staying disciplined around our target client strategy. 
We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity and capture the benefits of scale. However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise. 
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in U.S. Cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts and A/R and branded cards, which, as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016; the completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition, for which we are already ramping up operations but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around midyear; and finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment. Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near-term drag on our results. 
We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses, combined with certain other actions, will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year before improving in 2017 and thereafter. 
Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit cost to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year, and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. 
Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

We've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce, one, as we've wound down Holdings; and then, as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients and as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient, and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got -- I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in our -- in their nonoperating deposits. We came into the year with less than $100 billion of nonoperating deposits, and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of nonoperating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of nonoperating deposits because they're not there. As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, we -- our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket. However, the continued efforts that I'd just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year-end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet, and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers. So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21%. And as I think I remember, we reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%. Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized, such as our cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities, so I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly, our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact."

Obviously, as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last -- well, anyway, several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years. And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times, but the portfolio, in general, has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's, by and large, a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country, and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that, overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble. It doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it's a -- it produces a very resilient book of business. So in Russia, it's a little bit of just -- there's less business there. We're carefully managing credit lines. And really, nothing more than that. With Brazil, there's -- certainly, that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil. You'll recall that I mentioned the uptick in Latin America NCL in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that uptick is related to some losses that we took in a -- in the CCB, in our commercial business, and that is really centralized in Brazil, and it's this portfolio. We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases. And again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil."

So you've heard us on this call for quite a while talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening, branch closures, tighter target market in Korea. In Russia's case, there's a couple of levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs, and the other come as an after of that, and so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans -- your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink. But at the same time, as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies. And as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see. And in the case of Brazil, in some ways, a combination of those, a restructuring of what's going on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business, which didn't fit, which, in hindsight, was a terrific sale and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think it's part of our natural credit business process."

What I mentioned earlier is in -- I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit, but we also saw a slight uptick in Asia. You'll see that -- the uptick guidance from 79 bps to 84 bps, but it was there. And again,",564,"Yes, let me start again. What I mentioned earlier is in -- I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit, but we also saw a slight uptick in Asia. You'll see that -- the uptick guidance from 79 bps to 84 bps, but it was there. And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio, certainly, outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs, but most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China. So it's -- but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices, in particular, are a benefit to customers on a broader scale, probably, than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that. Now, obviously, if the economies go south due to the fact that -- and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow-on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today. And as I'd mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market, given our focus on higher-quality segments, which we think is really the right strategy for us. So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy. We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea. And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia that while it dampen our revenue prospects from time to time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story. And when you think about Asia, Asia accounts for 70% of our total international consumer portfolio. And we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. Even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points. And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of the -- our originations are the borrowers that would be comparable to 700-plus FICO scores in the U.S. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher-quality segments. I've mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%, and our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to 0. So I -- again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico was by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass-market borrowers in Mexico, it's -- the credit story has really improved because we've really, again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years. So again, pretty good."

Well, we moved a couple of large -- we have about $8 billion of loans into held-for-sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale, I have to run through my loan loss reserve. So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in Holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and move them into held-for-sale. So it's really tough. The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call which is think in terms of Holdings being marginally profitable on a EBT point of view in each quarter next year.

And then I can't do much to control OCI. But don't forget, what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA. And so that will -- especially when you think about the impact of our available-for-sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just merely a timing difference. The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that. And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. The -- probably -- the -- maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017, but we also utilized $1.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to -- that will -- that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well, and that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective, utilized FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near-term expiration date.

So overall, Holdings came down 23 -- the risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down $23 billion this quarter and OneMain was part of that. So when you look -- we've made continued progress in driving down Holdings.

You want to -- John, you want to start on China and just -- we can talk a little bit about -- and I think -- I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of Slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, is in some ways, quite informative. We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier in the diversifications there and the mix between North America and internationally. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to Page 30 and actually look at the balance. Look at the balance of our portfolio, it's the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition. And so when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM, where actually over 1/3 of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short-term nature, they're largely the multinationals. In the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized. So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all the disclosure in GIIPS, $1 of loan can take on -- or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings. And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in Corporate Lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality that books looks like. 37% or $42 billion of that is in short-term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking or private banking-related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same, and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go?"

And the overall portfolio has got -- it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio. You mentioned China, though. So let me -- you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do, Mike, in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we've put that, it's on Page 91 of our September 30 10-Q, and we'll update that when we file our 10-K. And if you take a look at Page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities, and you'll see that as of September 30, those 2 amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with the -- with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we updated this page in the 10-K. When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion, and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high-quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia. Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high-quality mortgage portfolio. Now, the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia, in aggregate, has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus. That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans. Same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700 and very good loss performance. And then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here, this portfolio has been broadly stable. So that leaves me with the last category that we give you, which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion, and the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio as Mike talked about the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China. More than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans, which are generally short-term secured financings or they're in the Private Bank. So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional Corporate Lending book. And over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state-owned Chinese companies. So as you would expect, with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'",1083,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter. 
Overall, our institutional businesses saw strong improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Investment Banking and our Private Bank as well as across our equities and Fixed Income businesses.  In consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking.  And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales, contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans and card purchase sales, and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios.  We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings' assets during the quarter, largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016. 
Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets.  Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs, and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet. We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis. 
I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last 3 years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity. At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets. While at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target, and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012, excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers.  Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup; and we reached 11%, excluding the capital, which supports our disallowed DTA. 
In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve. And as an example, we've exited or in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven. It now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet. And not only has Holdings broken even, it's been profitable for 6 straight quarters. Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over 1/3. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model. 
The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains.  In global consumer, we've reduced our branch footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest-growing cities while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio, reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year.  Our customer satisfaction, as measured by Net Promoter Scores, has improved meaningfully. 
We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings. We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012, we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last 3 years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last 3 years. Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders, and we reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend. 
We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope. We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions, which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. Every day, we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. 
While as the early days of 2016 have shown the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging and while there are bright spots such as the U.S., Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict. Volatility may present some trading opportunities, but more often, keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment. As I discussed earlier, we've worked hard to transform our company, and the changes we'd made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower-return consumer markets. We run a very balanced and tightly risk-managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients, and our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry. 
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

On",3212,"Hey, thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.  Starting on Slide 3. We highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. Expenses declined 23% year-over-year, driven by lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter, largely in Citicorp, compared to a net release in the prior year. On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup, including Citi Holdings, was 57.3%. Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 4% to $908 billion. 
On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year, driven by growth across our institutional franchise. Citicorp expenses declined 24%, reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net reserve build. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. We accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets, driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets. We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt, and we positioned Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward.  The net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we had previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves. 
On Slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth, to deliver a modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs. And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3%, while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points. As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise. 
Turning to each business. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow, up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America, driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio. We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact, however, with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates in ongoing regulatory pressures in cards. We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remain fairly stable sequentially, and we continue to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region. And in retail banking, we continue to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues. In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5%, and average deposits grew 5%. 
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain onetime items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets. However, we did see an uptick in net credit losses in certain markets in our commercial business, which serves small- and mid-sized companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year, including the impact of a $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads.  In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. 
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total U.S.-branded card loans. And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio. 
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues declined 1% from last year, mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6%, driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.  As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our 6 key markets, where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. 
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter, with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points, respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an uptick in the NCL rate to 4.8%. But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio, including losses on a wind-down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves. Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America, driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region. 
Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer Banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower-than-expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year, with broad-based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by growth in high-quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. 
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year. While our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity. Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year, with share gains across debt and loan origination, and M&A revenues grew 15%. Private Bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And Corporate Lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. 
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty. 
Turning to equities. Revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Securities Services, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.  Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy-related. 
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about 2/3 of which was offset by related reserve releases. Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy-related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time. And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio, about half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly 1/4 was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was dispersed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration.  With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or, in other words, credit cost of roughly $600 million in total for the first half. 
Taking a step back and looking at the full year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In Fixed Income, despite the volatile backdrop, our rates and currencies revenue grew 4% over the prior year, with momentum in both local markets and G10 products. Our local markets rates and currencies business was a remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015, generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year, with revenues approaching our near-term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter. M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid- to high single-digit revenue growth across TTS, Securities Services and the Private Bank. So while we face certain industry-wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continued to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015. 
On Slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower-than-anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014. 
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year, due in part to gains on debt buybacks; and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year-end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than 1/3 of this year-end amount relating to operational risk. As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and will continue to pursue other sales as well. 
On Slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges and other episodic items. As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016.  We currently expect the benefits of lower funding cost, the exit of loss-making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain. As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the asset should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA. 
On Slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated, due mostly to trading net interest margin. And our net interest margin for the full year was 293 basis points. 
Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings, partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks, for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio, which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter. We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016.  Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016, and then it will reflect Costco in the second half. 
On Slide 17, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. And importantly, within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017.  Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1%, and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share. 
To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult, with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and the slow trajectory for U.S. rate increases. But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp while staying disciplined around our target client strategy. We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity and capture the benefits of scale. However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise. 
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in U.S. Cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts and A/R and branded cards, which, as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016; the completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition, for which we are already ramping up operations but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around midyear; and finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment. Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near-term drag on our results. 
We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses, combined with certain other actions, will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year before improving in 2017 and thereafter. 
Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit cost to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year, and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

We've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce, one, as we've wound down Holdings; and then, as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients and as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient, and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got -- I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in our -- in their nonoperating deposits. We came into the year with less than $100 billion of nonoperating deposits, and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of nonoperating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of nonoperating deposits because they're not there. As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, we -- our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket. However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year-end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet, and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers. So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21%. And as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%. Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized, such as our cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities, so I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly, our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact."

Obviously, as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last -- well, anyway, several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years. And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times, but the portfolio, in general, has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's, by and large, a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country, and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that, overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble. Doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it's a -- it produces a very resilient book of business. So in Russia, it's a little bit of just -- there's less business there. We're carefully managing credit lines. And really, nothing more than that. With Brazil, there's -- certainly, that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil. You'll recall that I mentioned the uptick in Latin America NCL in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that uptick is related to some losses that we took in a -- in the CCB, in our commercial business, and that is really centralized in Brazil, and it's this portfolio. We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases. And again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil."

So you've heard us on this call for quite a while talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening, branch closures, tighter target market in Korea. In Russia's case, there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs, and the other come as an after of that, and so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans -- your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink. But at the same time, as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies. And as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see. And in the case of Brazil, in some ways, a combination of those, a restructuring of what's going on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business, which didn't fit, which, in hindsight, was a terrific sale and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think it's part of our natural credit business process."

Again, what I mentioned earlier is in -- I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit, but we also saw a slight uptick in Asia. You'll see that the uptick guidance from 79 bps to 84 bps, but it was there. And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio, certainly, outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs, but most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China. So it's -- but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices, in particular, are a benefit to customers on a broader scale, probably, than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that. Now, obviously, if the economies go south due to the fact that -- and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow-on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today. And as I'd mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market, given our focus on higher-quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us. So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy. We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea. And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia that while it may dampen our revenue prospects from time to time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story. And when you think about Asia, Asia accounts for 70% of our total international consumer portfolio. And we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points. And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of the -- our originations are to borrowers that would be comparable to 700-plus FICO scores in the U.S. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher-quality segments. I've mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%, and our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to 0. So I -- again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico was by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass-market borrowers in Mexico, it's -- the credit story has really improved because we've really, again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years. So again, pretty good. And spending pattern, you've seen the growth in purchase sales. It's still there. It's somewhat muted because of the overall economic environment, but it's still there."

Well, we moved a couple of large -- we have about $8 billion of loans into held-for-sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale, I have to run through my loan loss reserve. So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in Holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and move them into held-for-sale. So it's really tough.

And then I can't do much to control OCI. But don't forget, what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA. And so that will -- especially when you think about the impact of our available-for-sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just merely a timing difference. The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that. And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. The probably -- maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017, but we also utilized $1.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to -- that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well, and that's really, from a DTA planning point of view, that is our first and foremost most important objective, utilize FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near-term expiration date. The one thing that we never want to do is we never want to go into a year and have FTCs set to expire that year. So that's really how we think about DTA planning."

You want to -- John, you want to start on China and just we can talk a little bit about -- and I think -- I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of Slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, is in some ways, quite informative. We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier in the diversifications there and the mix between North America and international. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to Page 30 and actually look at the balance. Look at the balance of our portfolio, it's the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition. And so when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM, where actually over 1/3 of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short-term nature, they're largely the multinationals. In the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized. So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all the disclosure in GIIPS, $1 of loan can take on -- or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings. And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in Corporate Lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality that books looks like. 37% or $42 billion of that is in short-term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking or private banking-related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same, and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go?"

And the overall portfolio has got -- it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio. You mentioned China, though. So let me -- you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do, Mike, in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we put that, it's on Page 91 of our September 30 10-Q, and we'll update that when we file our 10-K. And if you take a look at Page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities, and you'll see that as of September 30, those 2 amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with the -- with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we update this page in the 10-K. When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion, and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high-quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia. Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high-quality mortgage portfolio. Now, the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia, in aggregate, has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus. That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans. Same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700 and very good loss performance. And then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here, this portfolio has been broadly stable. So that leaves me with the last category that we give you, which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion, and the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio as Mike talked about the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China. More than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans, which are generally short-term secured financings or they're in the Private Bank. So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional Corporate Lending book. And over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state-owned Chinese companies. So as you would expect, with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade."

So while this proposal could have a significant impact on our market risk RWA, you got to gauge it in the fact that we're talking about 6% of our total RWA."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll g",1083,"Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter. 
Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Investment Banking and our Private Bank as well as across our equities and Fixed Income businesses. In consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking. And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans and card purchase sales, and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios. We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter, largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016. 
Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets. Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs, and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet. We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis. 
I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last 3 years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, a Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity. At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets. While at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target, and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012, excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers. Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup and we reached 11%, excluding the capital which supports our disallowed DTA. 
In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve. And as an example, we've exited or in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven and now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet. And not only as Holdings broken even, it's been profitable for 6 straight quarters. Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over 1/3. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model. 
The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains. In global consumer, we've reduced our branch footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest-growing cities while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio, reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year. Our customer satisfaction, as measured by Net Promoter Scores, has improved meaningfully. 
We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings. We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012, we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last 3 years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last 3 years. Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders, and we reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend. 
We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope. We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions, which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. Every day, we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. 
While as the early days of 2016 have shown the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging and while there are bright spots such as the U.S., Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict. Volatility may present some trading opportunities, but more often, keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment. As I discussed earlier, we've worked hard to transform our company and the changes we've made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower-return consumer markets. We run a very balanced and tightly risk managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients, and our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry. 
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

On S",3214,"Hey, thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. We highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
On Slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. Expenses declined 23% year-over-year, driven by lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter, largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year. On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup, including Citi Holdings, was 57.3%. Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion. 
On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year, driven by growth across our institutional franchise. Citicorp expenses declined 24%, reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net reserve build. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. We accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets. We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt, and we position Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. The net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we had previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves. 
On Slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs. And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3%, while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points. As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise. 
Turning to each business. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow, up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America, driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio. We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact, however, with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards. We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remained fairly stable sequentially, and we continued to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region. And in retail banking, we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues. In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 5%. 
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain onetime items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets. However, we did see an uptick in net credit losses in certain markets in our commercial business, which serves small and mid-size companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year, including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. 
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total U.S.-branded card loans. And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio. 
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues declined 1% from last year, mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6%, driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our 6 key markets, where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. 
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter, with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points, respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an uptick in the NCL rate to 4.8%. But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio, including losses on a wind down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves. Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America, driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region. 
Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer Banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower-than-expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year, with broad-based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by growth in high-quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. 
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year. While our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity. Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year, with share gains across debt and loan origination, and M&A revenues grew 15%. Private Bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And Corporate Lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. 
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty. 
Turning to equities. Revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Securities Services, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy related. 
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about 2/3 of which was offset by related reserve releases. Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time. And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio, about half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly 1/4 was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was dispersed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration. With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or, in other words, credit cost of roughly $600 million in total for the first half. 
Taking a step back and looking at the full year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In Fixed Income, despite the volatile backdrop, our rates and currencies revenues grew 4% over the prior year, with momentum in both local markets and G10 products. Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015, generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year, with revenues approaching our near-term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter. M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid- to high single-digit revenue growth across TTS, Securities Services and the Private Bank. So while we face certain industry-wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continued to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015. 
On Slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower-than-anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014. 
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year, due in part to gains on debt buybacks; and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year-end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than 1/3 of this year-end amount relating to operational risk. As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and will continue to pursue other sales as well. 
On Slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges and other episodic items. As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pretax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales as well as improved credit. But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. We currently expect the benefits of lower funding cost, the exit of loss-making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain. As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the asset should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA. 
On Slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated, due mostly to trading net interest margin. And our net interest margin for the full year was 293 basis points. 
Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings, partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks, for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio, which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter. We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016, and then it will reflect Costco in the second half. 
On Slide 17, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. And importantly, within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1%, and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share. 
To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult, with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and a slow trajectory for U.S. rate increases. But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp while staying disciplined around our target client strategy. We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity and capture the benefits of scale. However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise. 
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in U.S. Cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts and A/R and branded cards, which, as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016; the completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition for which we are already ramping up operations but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around midyear; and finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment. Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near-term drag on our results. 
We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses, combined with certain other actions, will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year before improving in 2017 and thereafter. 
Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit cost to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year, and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce, one, as we've wound down Holdings; and then, as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients and as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient, and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got -- I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in our -- in their nonoperating deposits. We came into the year with less than $100 billion of nonoperating deposits, and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of nonoperating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of nonoperating deposits because they're not there. As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, we -- our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket. However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year-end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers. So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21%. And as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%. Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized, such as our cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities, so I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly, our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact."

Obviously, as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last -- well, anyway, several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years. And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times, but the portfolio, in general, has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's, by and large, a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that, overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble. Doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it's a -- it produces a very resilient book of business. So with Russia, it's a little bit of just -- there's less business there. We're carefully managing credit lines and really nothing more than that. With Brazil, there's certainly -- that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil. You'll recall that I mentioned the uptick in Latin America NCL in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that uptick is related to some losses that we took in a -- in the CCB, in our commercial business, and that is really centralized in Brazil and it's this portfolio. We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases. And again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil."

And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening branch closures, tighter target market in Korea. In Russia's case, there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs and the other come as an after of that and so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans -- your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink. But at the same time, as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies and as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see. And in the case of Brazil, in some ways a combination of those, a restructuring of what's going on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business which didn't fit, which in hindsight was a terrific sale and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think it's part of our natural credit and business process."

Again, what I mentioned earlier in -- I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit, but we also saw a slight uptick in Asia. You'll see that the uptick got us from 79 bps to 84 bps, but it was there. And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs, but most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China. So it's -- but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices, in particular, are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there. Now obviously, if the economies go south due to the fact that -- and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow-on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today. And as I'd mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher-quality segments and which we think is really the right strategy for us. So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy. We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea. And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia that while it may dampen our revenue prospects from time to time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story. And when you think about Asia, Asia accounts for 70% of our total international consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points. And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of the -- our originations are to borrowers that would be comparable to 700-plus FICO scores in the U.S. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher-quality segments. I've mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%, and our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to 0. So I -- again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico was by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass market borrowers in Mexico, it's -- the credit story has really improved because we've really, again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years. So again, pretty good. And spending pattern, you've seen the growth in purchase sales. It's still there. It's somewhat muted because of the overall economic environment but it's still there."

Well, we moved a couple of large -- we have about $8 billion of loans into held for sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale, I have to run through my loan loss reserve. So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in Holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and moved them into held for sale. So it's really tough.

There's an expiration date associated with that and so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. The probably -- maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017, but we also utilized $0.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to -- that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well, and that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective, utilize FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near-term expiration date. The one thing that we never want to do is we never want to go into a year and have FTCs set to expire that year. So that's really how we think about DTA planning."

You want to -- John, you want to start on China and just we can talk a little bit about -- and I think -- I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of Slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it is in some ways quite informative. We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier and the diversifications there and the mix between North America and international. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to Page 30 and actually look at the balance. Look at the balance of our portfolios, the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition. And so when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM, where actually over 1/3 of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short-term nature, they're largely to multinationals. In the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized. So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all the disclosure in GIIPS, $1 of loan can take on -- or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings. And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in Corporate Lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality of that books looks like. 37% or $42 billion of that is in short-term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking or private banking related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same, and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go?"

When we take a look at -- the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world and it's focused on those large multinationa",595,"And again, Mike, just to close out on Mike's thought. When we take a look at -- the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world and it's focused on those large multinationals and some very top tier large local corporates. And the overall portfolio has got -- it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio. You mentioned China though, so let me -- you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do, Mike, in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we put that -- it's on Page 91 of our September 30 10-Q and we'll update that when we file our 10-K. And if you take a look at Page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities, and you'll see that as of September 30, those 2 amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with the -- with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we update this page in the 10-K. When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion, and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high-quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia. Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high-quality mortgage portfolio. Now the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia in aggregate has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus. That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans. Same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700 and very good loss performance. And then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here this portfolio has been broadly stable. So that leaves me with the last category that we give you, which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion, and the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio as Mike talked about the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China. More than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans, which are generally short-term secured financings or they're in the Private Bank. So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional Corporate Lending book. And over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state-owned Chinese companies. So as you would expect, with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade."

We really give guidance on the RWA, but again, there are several things that would go on there. One, as you mentioned, we will continue to wind down Holdings and we will continue to get some benefit there. Currently, we would look to see that, that should more or less give us some ability then to manage growth in the rest of Citicorp with the exception, of course, of the addition of the Costco portfolio. But then you've got, on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet. So I think you might see some increase in RWA coming into 2016, but I wouldn't guide you to some huge amount of growth."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macroenvironment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized deferred tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses, while absorbing a significant repositioning charge. 
In our institutional businesses, market sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and Investment Banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues. 
Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business, including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom line results remained lower due to the investments we're making in that business. 
Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continue to focus on our targeted segments. Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S, Mexico and Asia, and we see real paths for growing our franchise. We've been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we're allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns. 
In the last 3 years, we've exited or in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. 
During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally. We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. Repositioning is part of our effort to make sure Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We've identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models, including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers, which now hosts more than half of our people. That will drive an additional reduction of headcount, which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO. 
We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from 1 year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn't done, the Holdings assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won't report Holdings result -- we will -- I'm sorry, we won't report Holdings typically after this year. 
I think being able to do this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind remaining assets. The wind down in Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and has been a long-time goal. We said we take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren't meaningful and up to merit separate reporting, and that's what we're doing. 
Another area that we focus on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DPAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%. We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under 100 million over the last 4 quarters. 
Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan. 
And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of the even stronger capital position and the improvements we've made in our capital planning process, as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions, have allowed us to make a strong submission. 
While 2016 didn't get off after the start we'd hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased and some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still rightful risk from political elections to interest rates. I think as we've shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we'll reduce it while still serving our clients. We think certain sectors are showing signs of weakness. We'll manage our exposures even more tightly. John will now go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to take questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results.

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted the Fed these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relates to Citi's own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So we no longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward, therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA. 
On Slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and Investment Banking, the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9%, including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
On Slide 5, we showed the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% for last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by Capital Markets-related businesses, fixed income, equities, Investment Banking and Asia wealth management, as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards. 
Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation. And cost and credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remain favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and delinquency rates both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year. 
Citi Holdings contribute pretax earnings of $477 million in this quarter mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter, ending the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we will report Citi Holdings as a separate segment. 
Turning now to each business. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2%, as growth in Retail Banking continue to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw a good momentum in Retail Banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in card, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year, card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit cost increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rate improved to 1.6%.
On Slide 7, we show Asian consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn't see the typical rebound in transaction activity. And therefore, our wealth management revenues declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future. 
Turning to cards. Card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment, but payment rates have stabilized. And as a result, our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle pass the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenues. So while card revenues still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we are on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year and credit trends remained favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia. 
Slide 8 shows of the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year, as continued growth in loans and deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage sale on revenues. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards cost, as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment. So we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008. 
And turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of 2 small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to its significant shift in customer behavior to digital channels. 
And finally, credit cost in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. 
On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly noninvestment-grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions, and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We'll provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation
On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards, including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products, and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. 
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year, and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter, but we believe we can return to growth some time in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. So as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are a few things to highlight on Slide 11. 
First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses, including wealth management, as well as mortgage, which together drove our year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. Cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underline performance improvement. And third, the impact of regulatory changes in our business, particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. 
When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we've achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses. In fact, year-over-year, the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning cost. As we move forward, we believe we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise. And that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well-positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% ROTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12. Revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities and Investment Banking. Total banking revenues of $4 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, declined 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, as well as improved deposit spreads. 
Investment Banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels, as well as our strong performance in M&A to prior year. Private Bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year, as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates and currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March, as market conditions improved versus in the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities. 
Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes and cash equities, as well as weaker performance and derivatives. In securities services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services business. And other, included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investment in Venezuela. And as a result of changes in the exchange rates. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning cost. Core expenses were down 1%, as higher regulatory and compliance cost and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit cost of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter, but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit cost this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $115 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices,, as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. 
At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion, of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2%, including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the noninvestment-grade portion. We have very little second lien exposure in the corporate portfolio with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly 1/3 of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio, as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures, in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
As we look at the potential for additional energy and nonenergy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. Now this is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion with about 2/3 of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio. 
If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve-based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion, of which $2 billion is funded, and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations. And year-to-date, we have seen no material drawdowns against these facilities. 
Turning back to ICG. We saw a significant increase in corporate nonaccrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter with roughly $5 billion funded. And we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter. 
The increase in nonaccrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly 2/3 of both the total admissions, as well as the energy-related additions to nonaccrual loans this quarter remain performing. 
On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continue to see growth in several of our accrual and Transaction Services businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, private bank and security services. The market environment had the biggest impact on fixed income equities and Investment Banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain new while preserving our client facing capabilities. And these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. 
The remaining EBIT drivers were the write-down of our investment in Venezuela and mark-to-market losses on lower hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher energy cost -- the higher credit cost in energy. 
Turning to the next slide. As I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, PPS, Corporate Lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues, and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we've deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly if some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. 
Our strategy, focus on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we will be new to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets in Investment Banking, but our mix of traditional banking and Transaction Services does provide a stable growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses. Where we believe revenues are likely to remain unit, we are taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities. And we are remaining disciplined on credit. So while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through a cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an ROTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment
Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related cost. On Slide 16, we showed Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while a Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat to the fourth quarter, as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter, as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year. 
On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.
Before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the flow forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense savings resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe Investment Banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels if the environment is favorable based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. 
And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and Transaction Services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier. On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year-over-year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.
Turning to Citicorp expenses. There are a few things to consider. First, we believe that regulatory and compliance cost have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to pay back with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning costs should be significantly lower with the remainder of the year. 
And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again, due to low revenue assumptions. 
While this quarter's results were disappointing, we are -- we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time, continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter, and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

But the ROE, tangible ROE, is still only 7%. You did say that the result were disappointing and that you'll get better returns with a, ""more normal environment"".

That implies the next 3 quarters should be much better than the 60%. If you could just clarify why that's the case. And the tougher one is the strategic question. Can't you accelerate restructuring more than what you've already done? You highlighted what you've done.

So the comments that we made on the 58%, what we said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. I think if you follow the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave, that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year. That has been our guidance for the full year. Tough to recover from the first quarter that we've had. We felt that it was important to get a balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that, again, with the outlook that we put forward by and large, we're there. So that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improved the returns and everything, one of the things that we need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion [ph] of capital, tangible common equity, tied up in DTA. It's hard for us and that's impossible for us to get a return on capital. What we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital, even our current business over the last 4 quarters in the environment that it is, whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, were generating a 10% return on the capital, excluding that capital tied up in DTA. Now it's not making an excuse, it's just showing you where we have the issue, which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing a DTA, which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability over time to return more capital to our shareholders. So that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about. There's another element. We continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it's now at the level that it is. We've got still more assets to do. That's capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return. We'll free that capital up and we'll return that capital to the shareholders. So those are elements of the path forward. And then the final one, as we've put out, we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% ROTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14%. In consumer, we told you where we're focused. We're focused on cards and wealth management. We think that that's the right path forward. We think that's right way to grow revenue. We think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses. We've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that will really benefit the efficiency ratio as well. In the ICG, we've got a nice base going and as accrual and transaction services business. 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating and in the last 2 years. Investment Banking, we feel really good about that franchise. It's a bad quarter. Now there wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in Investment Banking. So that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our fixed income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Now even in this environment, rates and currencies, revenues up 5% year-over-year, and those are good performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically, foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year, our real outperformance was in rates. We've got a great franchise in rates and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacity and split products. We're taking care of that. And finally, we are continuing to make investments in equities. Equities should help us over time. It did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward, Mike, we don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture. Mike, I don't know if you can comment."

Second piece around it is when we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico as an economy is headed. We like what we see, and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is as if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and submission processes, you actually don't know how much of that capital would actually liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So it's a good business. It's a growing business. We think it's a strategically important business.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macroenvironment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized deferred tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses, while absorbing a significant repositioning charge. 
In our institutional businesses, market-sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and Investment Banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues. 
Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business, including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom line results remained lower due to the investments we're making in that business. 
Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continue to focus on our targeted segments. Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S, Mexico and Asia, and we see real paths for growing our franchise. We've been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we're allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns. 
In the last 3 years, we've exited or in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. 
During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally. We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. The repositioning is part of our effort to make sure Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We've identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models, including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers, which now host more than half of our people. That will drive an additional reduction of headcount, which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO. 
We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from 1 year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn't done, with Holdings assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won't report Holdings result -- we will -- I'm sorry, we won't report Holdings separately after this year. 
I think being able to do this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets. The wind down in Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and has been a long-time goal. We said we'd take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren't meaningful enough to merit separate reporting, and that's what we're doing. 
Another area we've focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DPAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%. We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under 100 million over the last 4 quarters. 
Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan. 
And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we've made in our capital planning process as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions, have allowed us to make a strong submission. 
While 2016 didn't get off to the start we'd hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased and some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still ripe with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we've shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we'll reduce it while still serving our clients. We think certain sectors are showing signs of weakness. We'll manage our exposures even more tightly. John will now go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results.

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed -- these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relates to Citi's own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So we no longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward, therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA. 
On Slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and Investment Banking, the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9%, including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
On Slide 5, we showed the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by Capital Markets-related businesses, fixed income, equities, Investment Banking and Asia wealth management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards. 
Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and delinquency rates both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year. 
Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter, ending the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And, as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we will report Citi Holdings as a separate segment. 
Turning now to each business. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2%, as growth in Retail Banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw a good momentum in Retail Banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in cards, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year, card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit cost increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rate improved to 1.6%.
On Slide 7, we show Asia Consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn't see the typical rebound in transaction activity. And therefore, our wealth management revenues declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future. 
Turning to cards. Card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment, but payment rates have stabilized. And as a result, our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle pass the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenues. So while card revenues still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we are on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year and credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year, as continued growth in loans and deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards cost, as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008. 
And turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of 2 small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt towards significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. 
On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly noninvestment-grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions, and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We'll provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
On Slide 9, we showed some key performance indicators for North America branded cards, including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products, and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. 
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year, and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter, but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable-to -improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
So as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are a few things to highlight on Slide 11:
First is the impact of the current environment on market-sensitive businesses, including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove our year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. Cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third, the impact of regulatory changes in our business, particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. 
When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we've achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses. In fact, year-over-year, the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning cost. As we move forward, we believe we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise. And that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well-positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% ROTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12. Revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market-sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities and Investment Banking. Total banking revenues of $4 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, declined 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads. 
Investment Banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private Bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year, as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.
Total Markets & Securities Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates and currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March, as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities. 
Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes in cash equities as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In Securities Services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services business. And other, included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investment in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning cost. Core expenses were down 1%, as higher regulatory and compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit cost of $390 million was down from the fourth quarter, but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit cost this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $115 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. 
At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion, of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2%, including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the noninvestment-grade portion. We have very little second lien exposure in the corporate portfolio with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly 1/3 of this amount. We provided more details on the corporate portfolio as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures, in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
As we look at the potential for additional energy and nonenergy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. Now this is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion with about 2/3 of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio. 
If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve-based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion, of which $2 billion is funded, and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations. And year-to-date, we have seen no material drawdowns against these facilities. 
Turning back to ICG. We saw a significant increase in corporate nonaccrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter with roughly $5 billion funded. And we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter. 
The increase in nonaccrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly 2/3 of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to nonaccrual loans this quarter remain performing. 
On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continue to see growth in several of our accrual and Transaction Services businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, private bank and security services. The market environment had the biggest impact on fixed income equities and Investment Banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted while preserving our client-facing capabilities. And these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. 
The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investment in Venezuela and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher energy cost -- the higher credit costs in energy. 
Turning to the next slide. As I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, Corporate Lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues, and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we've deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. 
Our strategy focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we will be immune to revenue swings in more market-sensitive businesses like markets in Investment Banking, but our mix of traditional banking and Transaction Services does provide a stable growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses. Where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted, we are taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities. And we are remaining disciplined on credit. So while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through a cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an ROTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.
Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. On Slide 16, we showed Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat to the fourth quarter, as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year. 
On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.
Before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe Investment Banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels if the environment is favorable based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. 
And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and Transaction Services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier. On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year-over-year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.
Turning to Citicorp expenses. There are a few things to consider: First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to pay back with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning cost should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. 
And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again, due to low revenue assumptions. 
While this quarter's results were disappointing, we are -- we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time, continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter, and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

So the comments that we made on the 58%, what we said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you follow the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave, that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year. That had been our guidance for the full year. Tough to recover from the first quarter that we had. But we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that, again, with the outlook that we put forward, by and large, we're there. So that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improved the returns and everything, one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital, tangible common equity, tied up in DTA. It's hard for us, but not impossible for us, to get a return on that capital. What we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that, adjusting for that DTA capital, even our current business over the last 4 quarters in the environment that it is, whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital, excluding the capital tied up in DTA. Now it's not making an excuse. It's just showing you where we have the issue, which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA, which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability, over time, to return more capital to our shareholders. So that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about. There's another element. We'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it's now at the level that it is. We've got still more assets to do. That's capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return. We'll free that capital up. We'll return that capital to the shareholders. So those are elements of the path forward. And then the final is, as we've put out, we still believe that our Consumer business is capable of generating a 20% ROTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14%. In Consumer, we told you where we're focused. We're focused on cards and wealth management. We think that that's the right path forward. We think that's the right way to grow revenue. We think that those are both good-efficiency and high-return businesses. We've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that will really benefit the efficiency ratio as well. In the ICG, we've got a nice base going in those accrual and transaction services business, 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in in the last 2 years. Investment Banking, we feel really good about that franchise. It's a bad quarter. There wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in Investment Banking, and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our Fixed Income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Now even in this environment, rates and currencies, revenues up 5% year-over-year, and those are good-performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically, foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year. Our real outperformance was in rates. We've got a great franchise in rates, and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacity in spread products. We're taking care of that. And finally, we are continuing to make investments in equities. Equities should help us over time. It did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward, Mike.

I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise. And as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the Consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there. And when we look at the business in every sense of the word, it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico's economy is headed. We like what we see, and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and submission processes, you actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So it's a good business. It's a growing business. We think it's a strategically important business. And simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here, we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate-term decision."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized deferred tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses, while absorbing a significant repositioning charge. 
In our institutional businesses, market-sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and Investment Banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues. 
Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business, including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom line results remained lower due to the investments we're making in that business. 
Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted segments. Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S, Mexico and Asia, and we see real paths for growing our franchise. We've been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we're allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns. 
In the last 3 years, we've exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally. 
We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. The repositioning is part of our effort to make sure Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We've identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models, including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers, which now host more than half of our people. That'll drive an additional reduction of headcount, which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO. 
We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from 1 year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn't done, with Holdings' assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won't report Holdings results -- we will -- I'm sorry, we won't report Holdings separately after this year. 
I think being able to do this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets. The wind-down in Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and has been a long-time goal. We said we'd take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren't meaningful enough to merit separate reporting, and that's what we're doing. 
Another area we've focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DTAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%. We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under 100 million over the last 4 quarters. 
Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan. 
And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we've made in our capital planning process, as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions, have allowed us to make a strong submission. 
While 2016 didn't get off to the start we'd hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still ripe with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we've shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we'll reduce it while still serving our clients. If we think certain sectors are showing signs of weakness, we'll manage our exposures even more tightly. 
John will now go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior-period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed -- these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjus",3556,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior-period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed -- these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi's own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead, are reflected in OCI. So we no longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward, therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA. 
On Slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in Markets and Investment Banking, the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9%, including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year driven by the wind-down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
On Slide 5, we showed the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by Capital Markets-related businesses, fixed income, equities, Investment Banking and Asia wealth management, as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards. 
Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and delinquency rates both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year. 
Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter, ending the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And, as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we will report Citi Holdings as a separate segment. 
Turning now to each business. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2%, as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw a good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in cards, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year, card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments, primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit cost increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rate improved to 1.6%.
On Slide 7, we show Asia Consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia, with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn't see the typical rebound in transaction activity. And therefore, our wealth management revenues declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future. 
Turning to cards. Card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment, but payment rates have stabilized. And as a result, our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle pass the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenues. So while card revenues still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we are on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year, and credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year, as continued growth in loans and deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs, as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008. 
And turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of 2 small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. 
Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to its significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. 
On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business, with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly noninvestment grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions, and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards, including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products, and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. 
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year, and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well, even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter, but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable-to-improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
So as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are a few themes to highlight on Slide 11: First is the impact of the current environment on market-sensitive businesses, including wealth management, as well as mortgage, which together drove our year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. Cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third, the impact of regulatory changes in our business, particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. 
When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we've achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses. In fact, year-over-year, the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs. As we move forward, we believe we are making the right investments to grow the higher-return markets and products in our franchise. And, that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well-positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% ROTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12. Revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market-sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities and Investment Banking. Total banking revenues of $4 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, declined 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads. 
Investment Banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private Bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year, as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates and currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March, as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities. 
Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes in cash equities, as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In Securities Services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services business. And Other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investment in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses were down 1%, as higher regulatory and compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. 
Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter, but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $115 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices, as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. 
At quarter-end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion, of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2%, including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the noninvestment-grade portion. We have very little second lien exposure in the Corporate portfolio, with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly 1/3 of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio, as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures, in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
As we look at the potential for additional energy and nonenergy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. Now, this is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion, with about 2/3 of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio. 
If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve-based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion, of which $2 billion is funded, and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations. And year-to-date, we have seen no material drawdowns against these facilities. 
Turning back to ICG. We saw a significant increase in corporate nonaccrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially, with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter, with roughly $5 billion funded. And we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter. 
The increase in nonaccrual loans in metals and mining, as well as other sectors outside of energy, did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly 2/3 of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to nonaccrual loans this quarter remain performing. 
On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Private Bank and Securities Services. The market environment had the biggest impact on fixed income equities and Investment Banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client-facing capabilities. And these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. 
The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher energy costs -- the higher credit costs in energy. 
Turning to the next slide. As I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues, and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we have deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. 
Our strategy, focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis, is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we will be immune to revenue swings in more market-sensitive businesses like markets in Investment Banking, but our mix of traditional banking and Transaction Services does provide a stable growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher-return businesses. Where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted, we are taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities. And we are remaining disciplined on credit. So while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through a cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an ROTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.
Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
On Slide 16, we showed Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat to the fourth quarter, as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind-down of Citi Holdings with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year. 
On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.
Before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull-forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe Investment Banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels if the environment is favorable based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. 
And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and Transaction Services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier. On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year-over-year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And, of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.
Turning to Citicorp expenses. There are a few things to consider: First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to pay back with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning costs should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again, due to the low revenue assumptions. 
While this quarter's results were disappointing, we are -- we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time, continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter, and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

So the comments that we made on the 58%, what we've said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you follow the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave, that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year. That had been our guidance for the full year. Tough to recover from the first quarter that we had. But we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that, again, with the outlook that we've put forward, by and large, we're there. So that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improve the returns and everything, one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital, tangible common equity, tied up in DTA. It's hard for us, but not [ph] impossible for us, to get a return on that capital. What we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital, even our current business over the last 4 quarters in the environment that it is, whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital, excluding that capital tied up in DTA. Now it's not making an excuse. It's just showing you where we have the issue, which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA, which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability, over time, to return more capital to our shareholders. So that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about. There's another element. We'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it's now at the level that it is. We've got still more assets to do. That's capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return. We'll free that capital up. We'll return that capital to the shareholders. So those are elements of the path forward. And then the final is, as we've put out, we still believe that our Consumer business is capable of generating a 20% ROTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14%. In Consumer, we told you where we're focused. We're focused on cards and wealth management. We think that that's the right path forward. We think that's the right way to grow revenue. We think that those are both good-efficiency and high-return businesses. We've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that will really benefit the efficiency ratio as well. In the ICG, we've got a nice base going in those accrual and Transaction Services business; 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in in the last 2 years. Investment Banking, we feel really good about that franchise. It's a bad quarter. There wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in Investment Banking, and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our Fixed Income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Now even in this environment, rates and currencies, revenues up 5% year-over-year, and those are good-performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically, foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year. Our real outperformance was in rates. We've got a great franchise in rates, and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacity in spread products. We're taking care of that. And finally, we are continuing to make investments in equities. Equities should help us over time. It did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward, Mike.

I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise. And as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the Consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there. And when we look at the business in every sense of the word, it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico's economy is headed, we like what we see, and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex, based on capital planning and submission processes, you actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So it's a good business. It's a growing business. We think it's a strategically important business. And simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here, we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate-term decision."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized deferred tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses, while absorbing a significant repositioning charge. 
In our institutional businesses, market-sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and Investment Banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues. 
Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business, including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom line results remained lower due to the investments we're making in that business. 
Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted segments. Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S, Mexico and Asia, and we see real paths for growing our franchise. We've been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we're allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns. 
In the last 3 years, we've exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally. 
We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. The repositioning is part of our effort to make sure Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We've identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models, including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers, which now host more than half of our people. That'll drive an additional reduction of headcount, which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO. 
We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from 1 year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn't done, with Holdings' assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won't report Holdings results -- we will -- I'm sorry, we won't report Holdings separately after this year. 
I think being able to do this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets. The wind-down in Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and has been a long-time goal. We said we'd take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren't meaningful enough to merit separate reporting, and that's what we're doing. 
Another area we've focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DTAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%. We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under 100 million over the last 4 quarters. 
Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan. 
And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we've made in our capital planning process, as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions, have allowed us to make a strong submission. 
While 2016 didn't get off to the start we'd hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still ripe with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we've shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we'll reduce it while still serving our clients. If we think certain sectors are showing signs of weakness, we'll manage our exposures even more tightly. 
John will now go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed -- these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjus",3558,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed -- these new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi's own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead, are reflected in OCI. So we no longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward, therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA. 
On Slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in Markets and Investment Banking, the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9%, including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year driven by the wind-down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
On Slide 5, we showed the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by Capital Markets-related businesses, fixed income, equities, Investment Banking and Asia wealth management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards. 
Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and delinquency rates both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year. 
Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter, ending the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we will report Citi Holdings as a separate segment. 
Turning now to each business. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2%, as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw a good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in cards, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year, card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments, primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit cost increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rate improved to 1.6%.
On Slide 7, we show Asia Consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia, with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn't see the typical rebound in transaction activity. And therefore, our wealth management revenues declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future. 
Turning to cards. Card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment, but payment rates have stabilized. And as a result, our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle pass the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenues. So while card revenues still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we are on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year, and credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year, as continued growth in loans and deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. 
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs, as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008. 
And turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of 2 small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. 
Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to its significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. 
On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business, with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly noninvestment grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions, and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards, including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products, and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. 
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year, and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well, even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter, but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable-to-improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
So as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are a few themes to highlight on Slide 11: First is the impact of the current environment on market-sensitive businesses, including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove our year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. Cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third, the impact of regulatory changes in our business, particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. 
When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we've achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses. In fact, year-over-year, the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs. As we move forward, we believe we are making the right investments to grow the higher-return markets and products in our franchise. And that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well-positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% ROTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12. Revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market-sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities and Investment Banking. Total banking revenues of $4 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, declined 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads. 
Investment Banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private Bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year, as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates and currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March, as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities. 
Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes in cash equities as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In Securities Services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services business. And Other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investment in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses were down 1%, as higher regulatory and compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. 
Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter, but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $115 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. 
At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion, of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2%, including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the noninvestment-grade portion. We have very little second lien exposure in the Corporate portfolio, with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly 1/3 of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio, as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures, in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
As we look at the potential for additional energy and nonenergy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. Now this is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion, with about 2/3 of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio. 
If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve-based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion, of which $2 billion is funded, and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations. And year-to-date, we have seen no material drawdowns against these facilities. 
Turning back to ICG. We saw a significant increase in corporate nonaccrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially, with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter, with roughly $5 billion funded. And we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter. 
The increase in nonaccrual loans in metals and mining, as well as other sectors outside of energy, did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly 2/3 of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to nonaccrual loans this quarter remain performing. 
On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Private Bank and Securities Services. The market environment had the biggest impact on fixed income equities and Investment Banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client-facing capabilities. And these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. 
The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher energy costs -- the higher credit costs in energy. 
Turning to the next slide. As I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues, and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we have deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. 
Our strategy, focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis, is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we will be immune to revenue swings in more market-sensitive businesses like markets in Investment Banking, but our mix of traditional banking and Transaction Services does provide a stable growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher-return businesses. Where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted, we are taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities. And we are remaining disciplined on credit. So while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through a cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an ROTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.
Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. 
On Slide 16, we showed Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. 
Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat to the fourth quarter, as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind-down of Citi Holdings with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year. 
On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.
Before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull-forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe Investment Banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels if the environment is favorable based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. 
And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and Transaction Services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier. On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year-over-year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.
Turning to Citicorp expenses. There are a few things to consider: First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to pay back with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning costs should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again, due to the low revenue assumptions. 
While this quarter's results were disappointing, we are -- we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time, continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter, and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

So the comments that we made on the 58%, what we've said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you follow the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave, that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year. That had been our guidance for the full year. Tough to recover from the first quarter that we had. But we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that, again, with the outlook that we've put forward, by and large, we're there. So that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improve the returns and everything, one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital, tangible common equity, tied up in DTA. It's hard for us, but not [ph] impossible for us, to get a return on that capital. What we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital, even our current business over the last 4 quarters in the environment that it is, whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital, excluding that capital tied up in DTA. Now it's not making an excuse. It's just showing you where we have the issue, which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA, which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability, over time, to return more capital to our shareholders. So that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about. There's another element. We'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it's now at the level that it is. We've got still more assets to do. That's capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return. We'll free that capital up. We'll return that capital to the shareholders. So those are elements of the path forward. And then the final is, as we've put out, we still believe that our Consumer business is capable of generating a 20% ROTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14%. In Consumer, we told you where we're focused. We're focused on cards and wealth management. We think that that's the right path forward. We think that's the right way to grow revenue. We think that those are both good-efficiency and high-return businesses. We've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that will really benefit the efficiency ratio as well. In the ICG, we've got a nice base going in those accrual and Transaction Services business; 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in in the last 2 years. Investment Banking, we feel really good about that franchise. It's a bad quarter. There wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in Investment Banking, and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our Fixed Income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Now even in this environment, rates and currencies, revenues up 5% year-over-year, and those are good-performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically, foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year. Our real outperformance was in rates. We've got a great franchise in rates, and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacity in spread products. We're taking care of that. And finally, we are continuing to make investments in equities. Equities should help us over time. It did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward, Mike. We don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture. Mike, I don't know if you've got a comment."

I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise. And as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the Consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there. And when we look at the business in every sense of the word, it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico's economy is headed, we like what we see, and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex, based on capital planning and submission processes, you actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So it's a good business. It's a growing business. We think it's a strategically important business. And simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here, we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate-term decision."

And that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works, you're forced to build loan loss reserves basically over the first year that you have the portfolio. So think about Costco as it'll impact all the ratios. But from a net income point of view right now, it's basically breakeven. So that's not in there. The $1.4 billion that I gave you as for the forward look on ICG, that was all-in. That was not just energy. That's all-in ICG."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. These results were a significant improvement from the first quarter, not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets we're winding down in Citi Holdings. The results also show our institution's ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings' assets and utilized additional deferred tax assets. We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan, which was just approved, significant increases to the amount of capital will return over the next year.
In our institutional franchise, both our markets and Investment Banking businesses saw a rebound in client activity from the last quarter. And our Treasury and Trade Solutions business continued to grow revenues, as we won new mandates and supported our clients' needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.
In Global Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we've been investing in our U.S.-branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process. And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines. And in retail services, we are renewing our partnership with The Home Depot. We're excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. 
In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from 1 year ago. For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable, and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012. While our remaining DTA does hamper our return on tangible common equity, utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately 30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last 4 quarters. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.
We've been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time. And earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and as a result, we'll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next 4 quarters. The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result, combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan, shows the progress we continue to make in becoming a safer and stronger institution. 
Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We're continuing to navigate the consequences of the U.K. referendum on the EU on its economic impact and how exactly we'll structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the U.K. has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential camping, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases. 
I think we've navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high, and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there's been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done and we feel good about the client activity we're seeing. And while we don't know what's coming -- what will come in the months as we look forward, we're always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources, and I believe we're very well positioned from a capital, liquidity and capacity perspective. 
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings a",3276,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year. 
We earned $4 billion in the second quarter or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 5% to $938 billion. 
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in corp other. 
Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year. Pretax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a lower cost of credit. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity. Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9%, respectively, from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs and our existing portfolio as well as higher payment rates. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we are making in our core products. In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to date. Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly 2/3 being out of store. And the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size, had already grown to $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter. Costco is a great partner, and we're excited about the potential for this business. 
We're also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct mail, e-mail, phone and animal's club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality, growing portfolio at attractive returns. The impact of the renewal should lower pretax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pretax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond as certain additional revenue-sharing arrangements become effective. 
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot. 
We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year. As expected, volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals. We currently expect to operate the retail services business and an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit costs in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve build in branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat, and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business, with purchase sales up [ph] 7% versus last year. And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second half of 2016.
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower Wealth Management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs. 
On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While Wealth Management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both the revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second half of 2016. Retail banking revenues, excluding Wealth Management, were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans, as you can see on the lower right. The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second half of the year, with continued growth in higher-return personal loans and, therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Turning to Asia. As I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year, as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia in response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market. We've moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields, but combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year. We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which has seen slower overall market activity relative to last year. And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with the sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year, with revenue growth to follow thereafter.
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trends. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second half of the year.
On Slide 10, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market-sensitive businesses like Wealth Management and mortgage on a first half basis. As you can see, the continued impact of our cards [indiscernible] on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter. And the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we're seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America. Our expense growth for the first half was prominently driven by investments across our franchise as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter. And credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable, with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. We continued to capture market share and saw a strong momentum across payment products such as U.S. dollar clearing as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply train, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world. We're seeing the demand for our services increase, as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment. At the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions as well as our wallet share in all major products. Private Bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And Corporate Lending revenues of $389 million were down 18%, as higher loan volumes were more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs. 
Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates and currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the dates following the U.K. referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies. We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our Treasury and Trade Solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our Fixed Income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery, particularly in securitized products. 
Turning to equities. Excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. 
Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly 2/3 offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to nonaccrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter. The cost of credit related to energy was minimum, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves, and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices as well as increased capital markets activity. Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets, as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter. This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvement in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits. Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain. But we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million. 
On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows a significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first half growth, although modest, in our accrual and Transaction Services businesses despite certain headwind this quarter, led by our continued momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions. And with a strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in Fixed Income and Equities but remain down year-over-year in Investment Banking, given lower overall market activity. We remain disciplined in our core expense management, as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first half. The remaining EBT drivers, with the write-down of our investment in Venezuela; mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements; and, of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter. 
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year as well as lower debt buyback activity. And expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs. 
On Slide 14, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM and lower loan yield. Looking to the second half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields as well as the absence of a previously assumed the rate increase in the U.S.
On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In Consumer Banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter. International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year. 
Turning to the institutional business. We expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while Investment Banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our Treasury and Trade Solutions business as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients' day-to-day banking needs around the world.
Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp/Other revenues are expected to be close to 0, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million range, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains. Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at breakeven for the quarter. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to answer any questions."

So it's a constant trade-off. But the GSIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we're making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year. We worked to get there. And we ended the year, I'd say, in the very high end of that score range. And one of our goal is to remain a 3% GSIB and a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so we're actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you're right. Those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it's something that we're trying to actively manage.

But if you remember, we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated, when we purchased a loan portfolio, we acquire the receivables and recorded its fair value so there's no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR is built. If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a mature portfolio, in a mature portfolio, that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, since the acquired loans don't have an LLR, there's no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build, to a, let's call it, normalized LLR, for an acquired portfolio is actually dependent on how fast the new loans are created as well as how fast the old loans pay down. So if the paydown rate, really, that's the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high paydown rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more frontloaded than was the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you're going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. These results were a significant improvement from the first quarter, not just in the overall amount of earning",790,"Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. 
Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. These results were a significant improvement from the first quarter, not just in the overall amount of earnings but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets we're winding down in Citi Holdings. The results also show our institution's ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings' assets and utilized additional deferred tax assets. We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan, which was just approved, significantly increases the amount of capital we'll return over the next year.
In our institutional franchise, both our markets and Investment Banking businesses saw a rebound in client activity from the last quarter. And our Treasury and Trade Solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates and supported our clients' needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.
In Global Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we've been investing in our U.S.-branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process. And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines. And in retail services, we are renewing our partnership with The Home Depot. We're excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. 
In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from 1 year ago. For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable, and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter.
We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012. While our remaining DTA does hamper our return on tangible common equity, utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.
During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately 30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last 4 quarters. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.
We've been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time. And earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and as a result, we'll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next 4 quarters. The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result, combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan, shows the progress we continue to make in becoming a safer and stronger institution. 
Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We're continuing to navigate the consequences of the U.K. referendum on the EU on its economic impact and how exactly we'll structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the U.K. has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.
I think we've navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high, and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there's been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we're seeing. And while we don't know what's coming -- what will come in the months as we look forward, we're always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources, and I believe we're very well positioned from a capital, liquidity and capacity perspective.
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?"
391687,332357888,1007183,"Citigroup Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Citigroup Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well",3272,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.
We earned $4 billion in the second quarter or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year. Pretax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp was down from last year but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a lower cost of credit. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially but were down 4% from last year as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity. Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9%, respectively, from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs and our existing portfolio as well as higher payment rates. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we're making in our core products.
In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to date. Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly 2/3 being out of store. And the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size, had already grown to $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter. Costco is a great partner, and we're excited about the potential for this business. 
We're also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct mail, e-mail, phone and Admirals Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality, growing portfolio at attractive returns. The impact of the renewal should lower pretax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pretax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond as certain additional revenue-sharing arrangements become effective.
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot.
We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals. We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit costs in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve build in branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco, compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.
And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second half of 2016.
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.
On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both the revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second half of 2016.
Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management, were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans, as you can see on the lower right. The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second half of the year, with continued growth in higher-return personal loans and, therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global-branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Turning to Asia. As I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia in response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market. We've moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields, but combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year. We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which has seen slower overall market activity relative to last year.
And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with the sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year, with revenue growth to follow thereafter.
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trends. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% from the second half of the year.
On Slide 10, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market-sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis as you can see the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter. And the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we're seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.
Our expense growth for the first half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter. And credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable, with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. We continued to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products such as U.S. dollar clearing as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply train -- chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world.
We're seeing the demand for our services increase as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment. At the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions as well as our wallet share in all major products.
Private Bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And Corporate Lending revenues of $389 million were down 18% as higher loan volumes were more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates and currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the dates following the U.K. referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies. We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our Treasury and Trade Solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our Fixed Income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery, particularly in securitized products. 
Turning to equities. Excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly 2/3 offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to nonaccrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.
The cost of credit related to energy was minimum as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves, and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices as well as increased capital markets activity.
Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter. This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvement in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits. Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million. 
On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first half growth, although modest, in our accrual and Transaction Services businesses despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in Fixed Income and equities but remain down year-over-year in Investment Banking, given lower overall market activity. We remain disciplined in our core expense management as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year as well as lower debt buyback activity. And expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs. 
On Slide 14, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM and lower loan yield.
Looking to the second half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.
On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In Consumer Banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter. International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year. 
Turning to the institutional business. We expect market revenues to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while Investment Banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our Treasury and Trade Solutions business as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients' day-to-day banking needs around the world.
Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp/Other revenues are expected to be close to 0, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million range, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains. Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at breakeven for the quarter. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to answer any questions."

There's a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against. GSIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1, stress test capital, call that CCAR capital, there's just many, and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis. So it's a constant trade-off. But the GSIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we're making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year. We worked to get there. And we ended the year, though I'd say, in the very high end of that score range. And one of our goal is to remain a 3% GSIB and a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so we're actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you're right. Those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it's something that we're trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GSIB score, we come out right at 630.

What do we need as a buffer? And it's our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can't use. And in this environment, that's probably the bulk of earnings and DTA liberalization. And when you think about the difference between our TCE and our CE Tier 1, it's largely the $29 billion of disallowed DTA. And so as we liberate that, we'd like to return that. I think as part of that conversation, that's not nor it will be a perspective conversation.

But if you remember, we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated, when we purchased a loan portfolio, we acquire the receivables and they recorded a fair value, so there's no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR is built. If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a mature portfolio, in a mature portfolio, that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, since the acquired loans don't have an LLR, there's no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build, to a, let's call it, normalized LLR, for an acquired portfolio is actually dependent on how fast the new loans are created as well as how fast the old loans pay down. So if the paydown rate, really, that's the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio that gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high paydown rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more frontloaded than was the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you're going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. These results were a significant improvement from the first quarter, not just in the overall amount of earnings but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets we're winding down from Citi Holdings. The results also show our institution's ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings' assets and utilized additional deferred tax assets. We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan, which was just approved, significantly increases the amount of capital we'll return over the next year.
In our institutional franchise, both our markets and Investment Banking businesses saw a rebound in client activity from the last quarter. And our Treasury and Trade Solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates and supported our clients' needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.
In Global Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we've been investing in our U.S.-branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process. And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines. And in retail services, we are renewing our partnership with The Home Depot. We're excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. 
In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from 1 year ago. For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable, and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter.
We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012. While our remaining DTA does hamper our return on tangible common equity, utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.
During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately 30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last 4 quarters. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.
We've been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time. And earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and as a result, we'll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next 4 quarters. The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result, combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan, shows the progress we continue to make in becoming a safer and stronger institution. 
Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We're continuing to navigate the consequences of the U.K. referendum on the EU on its economic impact and how exactly we'll structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the U.K. has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.
I think we've navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high, and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there's been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we're seeing. And while we don't know what's coming -- what will come in the months as we look forward, we're always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources, and I believe we're very well positioned from a capital, liquidity and capacity perspective.
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?"
391687,332357888,1007279,"Citigroup Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Citigroup Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well",3273,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.
We earned $4 billion in the second quarter or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year. Pretax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp was down from last year but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a lower cost of credit. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially but were down 4% from last year as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity. Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9%, respectively, from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs and our existing portfolio as well as higher payment rates. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we're making in our core products.
In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to date. Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly 2/3 being out of store. And the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size, had already grown to $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter. Costco is a great partner, and we're excited about the potential for this business. 
We're also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct mail, e-mail, phone and Admirals Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality, growing portfolio at attractive returns. The impact of the renewal should lower pretax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pretax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond as certain additional revenue-sharing arrangements become effective.
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot.
We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals. We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit costs in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve build in branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco, compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.
And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second half of 2016.
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.
On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both the revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second half of 2016.
Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management, were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by a 3% growth in personal loans, as you can see on the lower right. The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second half of the year, with continued growth in higher-return personal loans and, therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global-branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Turning to Asia. As I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia in response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market. We've moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. 
We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields, but combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year. We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which has seen slower overall market activity relative to last year.
And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year, with revenue growth to follow thereafter.
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trends. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second half of the year.
On Slide 10, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market-sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis as you can see the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter. And the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we're seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.
Our expense growth for the first half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter. And credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable, with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. We continued to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products such as U.S. dollar clearing as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply train -- chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world.
We're seeing the demand for our services increase as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment. At the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions as well as our wallet share in all major products.
Private Bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And Corporate Lending revenues of $389 million were down 18% as higher loan volumes were more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates and currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the U.K. referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies. 
We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our Treasury and Trade Solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our Fixed Income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery, particularly in securitized products. 
Turning to equities. Excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly 2/3 offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to nonaccrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.
The cost of credit related to energy was minimum as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves, and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices as well as increased capital markets activity.
Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter. This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvement in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits. Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million. 
On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first half growth, although modest, in our accrual and Transaction Services businesses despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in Fixed Income and equities but remain down year-over-year in Investment Banking, given lower overall market activity. We remain disciplined in our core expense management as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year as well as lower debt buyback activity. And expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs. 
On Slide 14, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM and lower loan yield.
Looking to the second half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.
On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In Consumer Banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter. International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year. 
Turning to the institutional business. We expect market revenues to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while Investment Banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our Treasury and Trade Solutions business as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients' day-to-day banking needs around the world.
Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp/Other revenues are expected to be close to 0, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million range, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains. Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at breakeven for the quarter. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to answer any questions."

So that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference the early part of June.

There's a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against. GSIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1, stress test capital, call it [ph], CCAR capital, there's just many, and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis. So it's a constant trade-off. But the GSIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we're making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year. We worked to get there. And we ended the year, though I'd say, in the very high end of that score range. And one of our goal is to remain a 3% GSIB and a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so we're actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you're right. Those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it's something that we're trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GSIB score, we come out right at 630.

What do we need as a buffer? And it's our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can't use.

But if you remember, we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated, when we purchased a loan portfolio, we acquire the receivables and they're recorded at fair value, so there's no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR is built. If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a mature portfolio, in a mature portfolio, that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, since the acquired loans don't have an LLR, there's no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build, to a, let's call it, normalized LLR, for an acquired portfolio is actually dependent on how fast the new loans are created as well as how fast the old loans pay down. So if the paydown rate, really, that's the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio that gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high paydown rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more frontloaded than was the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you're going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. These results were a significant improvement from the first quarter, not just in the overall amount of earnings but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets we're winding down from Citi Holdings. The results also show our institution's ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings' assets and utilized additional deferred tax assets. We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan, which was just approved, significantly increases the amount of capital we'll return over the next year.
In our institutional franchise, both our markets and Investment Banking businesses saw a rebound in client activity from the last quarter. And our Treasury and Trade Solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates and supported our clients' needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.
In Global Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we've been investing in our U.S.-branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process. And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines. And in retail services, we are renewing our partnership with The Home Depot. We're excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. 
In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from 1 year ago. For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable, and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter.
We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012. While our remaining DTA does hamper our return on tangible common equity, utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.
During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately 30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last 4 quarters. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.
We've been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time. And earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and as a result, we'll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next 4 quarters. The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result, combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan, shows the progress we continue to make in becoming a safer and stronger institution. 
Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We're continuing to navigate the consequences of the U.K. referendum on the EU on its economic impact and how exactly we'll structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the U.K. has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.
I think we've navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high, and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there's been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we're seeing. And while we don't know what's coming -- what will come in the months as we look forward, we're always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources, and I believe we're very well positioned from a capital, liquidity and capacity perspective.
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?"
391687,332357888,1007310,"Citigroup Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Citigroup Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well",3273,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3. We show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, and expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.
We earned $4 billion in the second quarter or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year. Pretax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp was down from last year but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a lower cost of credit. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially but were down 4% from last year as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity. Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9%, respectively, from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs and our existing portfolio as well as higher payment rates. I'll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we're making in our core products.
In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to date. Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly 2/3 being out of store. And the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size, had already grown to $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter. Costco is a great partner, and we're excited about the potential for this business. 
We're also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct mail, e-mail, phone and Admirals Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality, growing portfolio at attractive returns. The impact of the renewal should lower pretax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pretax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond as certain additional revenue-sharing arrangements become effective.
Finally, turning to retail services. Revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot.
We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals. We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit costs in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve build in branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco, compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.
And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second half of 2016.
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.
On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both the revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second half of 2016.
Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management, were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by a 3% growth in personal loans, as you can see on the lower right. The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second half of the year, with continued growth in higher-return personal loans and, therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global-branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Turning to Asia. As I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia in response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market. We've moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. 
We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields, but combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year. We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which has seen slower overall market activity relative to last year.
And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year, with revenue growth to follow thereafter.
Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trends. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second half of the year.
On Slide 10, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market-sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis as you can see the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter. And the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we're seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.
Our expense growth for the first half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter. And credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable, with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 11. Revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. We continued to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products such as U.S. dollar clearing as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply train -- chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world.
We're seeing the demand for our services increase as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment. At the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions as well as our wallet share in all major products.
Private Bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And Corporate Lending revenues of $389 million were down 18% as higher loan volumes were more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates and currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the U.K. referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies. 
We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our Treasury and Trade Solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our Fixed Income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery, particularly in securitized products. 
Turning to equities. Excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly 2/3 offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to nonaccrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.
The cost of credit related to energy was minimum as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves, and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices as well as increased capital markets activity.
Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter. This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvement in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits. Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million. 
On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first half growth, although modest, in our accrual and Transaction Services businesses despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in Fixed Income and equities but remain down year-over-year in Investment Banking, given lower overall market activity. We remain disciplined in our core expense management as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements and, of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year as well as lower debt buyback activity. And expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs. 
On Slide 14, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM and lower loan yield.
Looking to the second half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.
On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In Consumer Banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter. International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year. 
Turning to the institutional business. We expect market revenues to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while Investment Banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our Treasury and Trade Solutions business as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients' day-to-day banking needs around the world.
Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp/Other revenues are expected to be close to 0, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million range, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains. Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at breakeven for the quarter. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to answer any questions."

So that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference the early part of June.

There's a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against. GSIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1, stress test capital, call it [ph], CCAR capital, there's just many, and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis. So it's a constant trade-off. But the GSIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we're making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year. We worked to get there. And we ended the year, though I'd say, in the very high end of that score range. And one of our goal is to remain a 3% GSIB and a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so we're actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you're right. Those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it's something that we're trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GSIB score, we come out right at 630.

What do we need as a buffer? And it's our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can't use.

But if you remember, we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated, when we purchased a loan portfolio, we acquire the receivables and they're recorded at fair value, so there's no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR is built. If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a mature portfolio, in a mature portfolio, that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, since the acquired loans don't have an LLR, there's no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build, to a, let's call it, normalized LLR, for an acquired portfolio is actually dependent on how fast the new loans are created as well as how fast the old loans pay down. So if the paydown rate, really, that's the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio that gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high paydown rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more frontloaded than was the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you're going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing. 
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a onetime gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network. 
In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits. 
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex. 
Turning to our dwindling noncore assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from 1 year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately. 
We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from 1 year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan. In the past 2 years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from 1 year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns. 
Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases that the Fed has clearly been dubbish [ph] up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth. 
John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well",3097,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve billed this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year. Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of onetime gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. 
In constant dollars, Citigroup ended period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion. That 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion. 
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pretax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed onetime items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business. Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core 6 markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank. And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers. 
Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter. 
Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. 
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly 1/3 of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another 1/3 was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining 1/3 predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections. 
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability. In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points. 
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. This retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment. 
And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continue to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time. 
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable. 
On Slide 7, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward. 
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period. 
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year. 
On Slide 9, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year. 
Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment. In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.
Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed level we saw in late 2015. 
Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year. 
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves. And we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations. 
On Slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark [ph] losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements. 
As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains. 
Slide 12 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting cost related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.
On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.
On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0. 
Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And costs of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff. So when I look at Slide 19, I want help in your words interpreting it. At Citigroup, the return on tangible is not where you want it to be, not earnings, the cost of capital. Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great."

What you see in Corp/Other, I think we laid this out in some of the slides we used at the Financial Services Conference early in September.

And again, we're waiting to see where the whole CCAR process and the various rules as far as Basel III enhanced or Basel IV come out, but we recognize our debt capital there. And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom. So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders."

[indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last 2 years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last 2 years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future."

So again, we've beaten spread products down. There's some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers.

We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up."

The numbers, I would say, as we look at kind of where we are, which is an 8 9 [ph] position going, as John described, to 5 6 [ph], it varies a bit by quarter and will vary a bit based on some of the volumes. We're at about $250 million of revenue per quarter, so theoretically, about $1 billion of revenue a year. We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really 2 key areas: one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business; and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats. And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute. I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that very challenged volume market, it's tough to take share. So we're getting the right signals in terms of some of the early KPIs around broker votes, around some of the feedback of some of the services that come back and tell you your ranking. We just haven't seen that yet translating or manifesting itself into significant changes. But I think you saw us a while back say we were going to do this in the investment bank, and we made improvements there. We said we were going to do this in the private bank, and we've made improvements there. And so this is one of those things. We're going to hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it'd probably, in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time."

So it's a little bit hard to talk about cushion against the speech. I'd just assume to see the rules before we actually get into public discussion about whether or not we need cushion. We also need to -- if this is the way it's going to be, you need then to reassess just how variable those results are. So we'll look at all of those things.

We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business.

And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years.

So then you ask, ""Okay, so what actually happened?"" Well, we got the 3 basis points from Costco. As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too. But as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking from lowering the average cash or HQLA. And then finally, we had a 2 basis point hit with the lower NIM on our trading book. The trading book NIM is always difficult to forecast.

Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing. 
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a onetime gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network. 
In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits. 
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex. 
Turning to our dwindling noncore assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from 1 year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately. 
We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from 1 year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan. In the past 2 years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from 1 year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns. 
Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases that the Fed has clearly been dubbish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth. 
John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well",3096,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve billed this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year. Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of onetime gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. 
In constant dollars, Citigroup ended period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion. That 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion. 
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pretax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed onetime items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business. Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core 6 markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank. And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers. 
Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter. 
Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. 
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly 1/3 of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another 1/3 was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining 1/3 predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections. 
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability. In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points. 
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. This retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment. 
And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continue to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time. 
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable. 
On Slide 7, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward. 
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period. 
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year. 
On Slide 9, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year. 
Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment. In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.
Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed level we saw in late 2015. 
Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year. 
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves. And we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations. 
On Slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements. 
As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains. 
Slide 12 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting cost related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.
On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.
On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0. 
Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And costs of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff.

Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be.

And again, we're waiting to see where the whole CCAR process and the various rules as far as Basel III enhanced or Basel IV come out, but we recognize our debt capital there. And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom. So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders."

[indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last 2 years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last 2 years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future."

So again, we've beaten spread products down. There's some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers. So it's our expectation that, again, around a backdrop of a path towards slowly increasing rates and repositioning the portfolios, volumes continue to work their way back up. We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up."

It's going to take at least a full year to really get there before it gets accretive just because of the way the loan loss reserve mechanics come. So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up.

And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute.

As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing. 
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a onetime gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network. 
In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits. 
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex. 
Turning to our dwindling noncore assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from 1 year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately. 
We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from 1 year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan. In the past 2 years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from 1 year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns. 
Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases that the Fed has clearly been dubbish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth. 
John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well",3096,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve billed this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year. Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of onetime gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. 
In constant dollars, Citigroup ended period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion. That 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion. 
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pretax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed onetime items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business. Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core 6 markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank. And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers. 
Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter. 
Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. 
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly 1/3 of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another 1/3 was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining 1/3 predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections. 
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability. In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points. 
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment. 
And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time. 
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable. 
On Slide 7, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward. 
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period. 
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year. 
On Slide 9, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year. 
Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment. In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.
Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed level we saw in late 2015. 
Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year. 
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves. And we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations. 
On Slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements. 
As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains. 
Slide 12 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting costs related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.
On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.
On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0. 
Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And cost of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff. So when I look at Slide 19, I want help in your words interpreting it. At Citigroup, the return on tangible is not where you want it to be, not earnings, the cost of capital. Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great."

And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom. So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down Holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders."

[indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last 2 years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last 2 years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future."

So again, we've beaten spread products down to some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers. So it's our expectation that, again, around a backdrop of a path towards slowly increasing rates and repositioning the portfolios, volumes continue to work their way back up. We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up."

So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up.

We're at about $250 million of revenue per quarter, so theoretically, about $1 billion of revenue a year. We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really 2 key areas: one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business; and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats. And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute. I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that in a very challenged volume market, it's tough to take share. So we're getting the right signals in terms of some of the early KPIs around broker votes, around some of the feedback of some of the services that come back and tell your ranking. We just haven't seen that yet translating or manifesting itself into significant changes. But I think you saw us a while back say we were going to do this in the investment bank, and we made improvements there. We said we were going to do this in the private bank, and we've made improvements there. And so this is one of those things we're going to hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it's probably -- in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time."

We also need to -- if this is the way it's going to be, you need then to also reassess just how variable those results are. So we'll look at all of those things.

We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business.

We've said that we intend to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in the fourth quarter. And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years.

So that's sort of how we got to the 290. So then you ask, ""Okay, so what actually happened?"" Well, we got the 3 basis points from Costco. As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too. But as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking from lowering the average cash or HQLA. And then finally, we had a 2 basis point hit by -- with lower NIM on our trading book, and the trading book NIM is always difficult to forecast.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in severa",654,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. 
Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing. 
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a onetime gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network. 
In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits. 
Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex. 
Turning to our dwindling noncore assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from 1 year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately. 
We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from 1 year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan. In the past 2 years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from 1 year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns. 
Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases that the Fed has clearly been dubbish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth. 
John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?"

Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well",3096,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve billed this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year. Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of onetime gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. 
In constant dollars, Citigroup ended period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion. That 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion. 
On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pretax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed onetime items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business. Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other. 
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region. 
Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continued to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core 6 markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank. And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers. 
Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter. 
Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. 
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion. 
And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly 1/3 of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another 1/3 was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining 1/3 predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections. 
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability. In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points. 
On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment. 
And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. 
Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time. 
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable. 
On Slide 7, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward. 
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period. 
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year. 
On Slide 9, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year. 
Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment. In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.
Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise. 
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed level we saw in late 2015. 
Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year. 
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves. And we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations. 
On Slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements. 
As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains. 
Slide 12 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting costs related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.
On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.
On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0. 
Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And cost of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven. 
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions."

A small bit will come as we continue to wind down Holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders."

[indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding.

And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last 2 years, I just think is a bit outsized.

We -- when we brought on Costco, we said that just given the purchase accounting, Costco will not be really accretive to our earnings until sometime in the latter part of '17. It's going to take at least a full year to really get there before it gets accretive just because of the way the loan loss reserve mechanics come. So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up. I can't give you the exact timing, John, but it's sometime either in late '17 or certainly in '18 and then throughout '19, we should see a steady drive towards increased profitability coming out of the cards business."

And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute.

As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too.
