The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our prepared remarks. I will cover highlights and our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume grew 1%, and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 3%, and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. 
Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our international business on a currency neutral basis. Market share in the U.S., during the quarter, increased 1/10 of a point versus the year-ago period up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. 
We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the 6-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period. 
Looking at our categories, 5 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. 
As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working. 
And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season today. 
Building on our Cleaning and the flow growth platform, we began shipping 3 new Clorox ScrubSingle items in December: heavy duty, decide a size and multipurpose. These items build on previously launched new products such as Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers, which have done particularly well in market. 
Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox Bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less product line. Splash-less bleach is a trade up from our regular product,and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin-accretive product helping to drive profitable growth. 
Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business, which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year '16, we continue to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly. 
Switching to the Household segment. We delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags and Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped the price increase taken in November of 2014 and also increased trade promotion spending. Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. 
In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze, and we're also launching 2 new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category. 
Turning to Charcoal and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also, at the tail end of the quarter, we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal offerings with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. 
Turning to Cat Litter. In second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf, and advertising starts in a few days. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Sales grew 2% with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in Food, partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales on our food business grew solidly behind our ranch with bottled salad dressings such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt. 
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December, we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media, and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns. 
On our Burt's Bees business, sales grew double digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream and new mint cocoa and caramel apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, in International, sales declined 7%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates essentially across all markets. However, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations. 
And with that, I'll now turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."

Importantly, we continue to expand our margins by dr",736,"Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, we grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the international segment on a currency neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in 5 years, which helped to mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about 3 points, offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel; 130 basis points of cost savings; and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continue to increase total demand building investments to support our brands. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion. 
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. 
Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands. We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. 
On a currency neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about 3 points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing International economies and about 3 points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories. 
We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in International markets and weaker currencies. 
In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings product line and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83. 
In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

We're especially pleased to have delivered 18% diluted EPS growth in Q2, driven by robust margin expansion. 
Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year. 
And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy and our outlook for the second half. 
First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments, and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments, translated to U.S. market share and category growth. 
Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth, and we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than 5 years. 
Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work, and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2. And while still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy. 
In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability, and I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares. So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. 
And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. 
We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selected categories, and I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. 
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

I think you're going to see a split of that investment. Some's going to go into trade promotion spending, and then I think some is going to go into advertising. To dimensionalize it over the long term, we talk about advertising being at this 9% to 10% of sales level. I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year, and a lot of it is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products. So if we can get trial, we get repeats. So you're going to see us continue to lean in on both the innovation as well as of of our base products, and then the spend should start to ramp as you move through the second half of the fiscal year."

We do anticipate on a full year basis, gross margin will be up about a point, could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out, but it's likely to be flattish in the second half. And the reason for that is a couple of fold. First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal '15, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit. So we're certainly comping that, and actually holding on to those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spanning, and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year. And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal '15. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins.

But what happened after that very much that you described that gross margins were a little bit more challenged, and I get that. You have to put more back into trade spend. You have to invest in commodity, Steve, as you said back into the business, and so that I get your guidance going forward, and feels like it'll be the next 4 quarters, not just the back half of the year. But also happen subsequent was that your top line felt quite flat. That was a very different time frame arguably, but it really like a 2-point drop in your top line growth as you have to spend back was more than anticipated into the business from commodities. So wasn't just gross margin issue, it was also a top line start to slow. And I ask -- I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slow down dramatically as well as it has done when you kind of exited the sweet spot of commodities and pricing."

Home Care is a business where we've been very successful, and we certainly noted that in our Q2 remarks and where we've been gaining market share over a number of periods, and we expect that our category in particular in Wipes, which is the hotbed where we're doing particularly well, to become more competitive from a branded competitive point of view in the back half.

This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees, where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago, and we're investing behind lipsticks but also the base business to keep it that way. Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compare to some of the more expensive brands out there. This delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive, and we'll continue to drive that without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body that we're already in, and we'll continue to have a balanced investment programs.

So I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do 2 things: one, if commodity start to recover, and we don't think that will happen in the short term but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending in commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D.

Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit.
Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights in our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume grew 1%, and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 3%, and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. 
Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our international business on a currency neutral basis. Market share in the U.S., during the quarter, increased 1/10 of a point versus the year-ago period up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. 
We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the 6-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period. 
Looking at our categories, 5 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. 
As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working. 
And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season to date. 
Building on our Cleaning and the flow growth platform, we began shipping 3 new Clorox ScrubSingle items in December: heavy duty, decide a size and multipurpose. These items build on previously launched new products such as Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers, which have done particularly well in market. 
Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox Bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less product line. Splash-less bleach is a trade up from our regular product, and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin-accretive product helping drive profitable growth.
Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business, which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year '16, we continued to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly. 
Switching to the Household segment. We delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags and Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped the price increase taken in November of 2014 and also increased trade promotion spending. Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. 
In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze, and we're also launching 2 new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category. 
Turning to Charcoal and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also, at the tail end of the quarter, we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal offerings with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. 
Turning to Cat Litter. In second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf, and advertising starts in a few days. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Sales grew 2%, with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in Food, partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales on our food business grew solidly behind our ranch with bottled salad dressings, such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our dry, Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December, we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media, and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns. 
On our Burt's Bees business, sales grew double digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, and new mint cocoa and caramel apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, in International, sales declined 7%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates essentially across all markets. However, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins.
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of the fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations. And with that, I'll now turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."
89450,321490330,927037,"The Clorox Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, we grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the international segment on a currency neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to expand our margins by dr",735,"Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, we grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the international segment on a currency neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in 5 years, which helped to mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about 3 points, offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel; 130 basis points of cost savings; and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.
Selling administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter.
Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continue to increase total demand building investments to support our brands. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continued to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth, offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. 
Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands. We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International, due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. 
On a currency neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about 3 points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing International economies and about 3 points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories. 
We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in International markets and weaker currencies.
In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings pipeline and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83.
In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

We're especially pleased to have delivered 18% diluted EPS growth in Q2, driven by robust margin expansion. 
Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year. 
And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy and our outlook for the second half. First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments, and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments, translated to U.S. market share and category growth. 
Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth, and we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than 5 years. 
Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work, and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2. And while still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy. 
In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability, and I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares. So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. 
And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. 
We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selected categories. And I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business, while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. 
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

To dimensionalize it, over the long term, we talk about advertising being at this 9% to 10% of sales level. I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year, and a lot of it is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products. So if we can get trial, we get repeats. So you're going to see us continue to lean in on both the innovation as well as some of our base products, and then the spend should start to ramp up as you move through the second half of the fiscal year."

I think we're up a little over 2 full points, which feels pretty good. We do anticipate, on a full year basis, gross margin will be up about a point, could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out, but it's likely to be flattish in the second half. And the reason for that is a couple of fold. First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal '15, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit. So we're certainly comping that, and actually holding on to those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spending, and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year. And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half, again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal '15. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins. We certainly feel good about the trends, and importantly, we feel very good about the full year outlook for the EBIT margin that we've shared with you today."

Argentina represents about 4% of our sales Now let me be clear, that was before the devaluation that we settle in December, which you might recall we anticipated and built into our outlook.

It's unfolding about as we had expected. I do think in the second half of the fiscal year and probably for calendar '16, Argentina will weigh on results a bit, following the devaluation.

You have to invest in that commodity. Steve, as you said back into the business. And so that I get, your guidance going forward, and it feels like it'll be next 4 quarters, not just the back half of the year. But also happened subsequent was that your top line felt quite flat. That was a very different time frame arguably, but really was like a 2-point drop in your top line growth as you had to spend back was more than anticipated into the business from commodities.

And I ask -- I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward, and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slow down dramatically as well as it has done when you've kind of exited this sweet spot of commodities and pricing."

Home Care is a business where we've been very successful, and we've certainly noted that in our Q2 remarks and where we've been gaining market share over a number of periods, and we expect that our category in particular in Wipes, which is the hotbed where we're doing particularly well, to become more competitive from a branders competitor point of view in the back half.

I'm very happy you liked it, and that's very consistent with the initial consumer response that we get and certainly also the response from our customers. This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees, where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago. And we're investing behind lipsticks, but also the base business to keep it that way. Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to, $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compare to some of the more expensive brands out there. This delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive, and we'll continue to drive that without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body that we're already in, and we'll continue to have a balanced investment program.

So I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do 2 things: one, if commodity start to recover, and we don't think that will happen in the short term, but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending in commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D.

One thing that Steve Robb noted earlier is that a lot of the spend in the back half, as was the case in the front half, went into the support for innovations.

Trade spend is spending that drives our brand equities, and I think you know that we have a very disciplined approach to how we spend. We spend where we get the greatest ROI, short term and long term, and we believe that trade, in particular during times when you have strong innovation, certainly plays a role in driving our brand equities and continuing driving the strong brand health that we have today and that we expect to have in the future too."

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights in our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume grew 1%, and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 3%, and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. 
Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our international business on a currency neutral basis. Market share in the U.S., during the quarter, increased 1/10 of a point versus the year-ago period up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. 
We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the 6-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period. 
Looking at our categories, 5 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. 
As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working. 
And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season to date. 
Building on our Cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, we began shipping 3 new Clorox ScrubSingle items in December: heavy duty, decide a size and multipurpose. These items build on previously launched new products such as Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers, which have done particularly well in market. 
Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox Bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less product line. Splash-less bleach is a trade up from our regular product, and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin-accretive product helping to drive profitable growth.
Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business, which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year '16, we continue to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly. 
Switching to the Household segment. We delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags and Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped the price increase taken in November of 2014 and also increased trade promotion spending. Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. 
In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze, and we're also launching 2 new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category. 
Turning to Charcoal and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also, at the tail end of the quarter, we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal offerings with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. 
Turning to Cat Litter. In second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf, and advertising starts in a few days. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Sales grew 2%, with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in Food, partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales on our food business grew solidly behind our ""ranch with"" bottled salad dressings, such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December, we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media, and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns. 
On our Burt's Bees business, sales grew double digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, and new mint cocoa and caramel apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, in International, sales declined 7%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially, across all markets. However, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins.
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of the fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."

Well, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, we grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the international segment on a currency neutral basis. Importantly, we continued to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in 5 years, which helped mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about 3 points, offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel; 130 basis points of cost savings; and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter.
Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continue to increase total demand-building investments to support our brands. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth, offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. 
Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands. We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International, due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. 
On a currency neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about 3 points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing International economies and about 3 points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories. 
We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in International markets and weaker currencies.
In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings pipeline and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83.
In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

We're especially pleased to have delivered 18% diluted EPS growth in Q2, driven by robust margin expansion. 
Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year. 
And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy and our outlook for the second half. First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments, and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments, translated to U.S. market share and category growth. 
Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth, and we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than 5 years. 
Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work, and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2. And while still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy. 
In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares. So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. 
And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. 
We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selected categories. And I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business, while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. 
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year, and a lot of this is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products.

I think we're up a little over 2 full points, which feels pretty good. We do anticipate, on a full year basis, gross margin will be up about a point, could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out, but it's likely to be flattish in the second half. And the reason for that is a couple of fold. First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal '15, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit. So we're certainly comping that, and actually holding on to those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spending, and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year. And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half, again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal '15. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins.

And I would say, just related to the devaluation of Argentina, we anticipated it. It's unfolding about as we had expected.

But what happened after that very much as you described is that gross margins were a little bit more challenged, and I get that. You have to put more back into trade spend. You have to invest in the commodity -- Steve, as you said back into the business. And so that I get, your guidance going forward, and it feels like it'll be next 4 quarters, not just the back half of the year. But what also happened subsequent was that your top line felt quite flat. That was a very different time frame, arguably, but really it was like a 2-point drop in your top line growth as you had to spend back was more than anticipated into the business from commodities. So it wasn't just a gross margin issue, it was also the top line started to slow. And I ask -- I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward, and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slow down dramatically as well as it has done when you've kind of exited this sweet spot of commodities and pricing."

This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees, where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago. And we're investing behind lipsticks, but also the base business to keep it that way. Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to, $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compared to some of the more expensive brands out there this delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive, and we'll continue to drive that without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body that we're already in, and we'll continue to have a balanced investment program. Certainly, I think, some of you had noted that while we've seen a solid -- a sales increase in the Lifestyle segments that the profitability has not followed that sales increase.

And we are, in fact, taking pricing across a number of the international businesses today. So I wouldn't say, Lauren, that there's a difference between U.S., International and our track record to take pricing in International is very strong. Now at this point, are we able to close the entire gap that we see from -- or the entire amount of cost increases that we're seeing through inflation in International? No. But we are taking pricing pretty broadly. As you might have seen, our volume in International has been somewhat flat, and our organic sales growth was 6%, and much of that difference was certainly driven by pricing. So I feel optimistic about where we are in pricing in International, and we have a pretty good read on what happens, and it's pretty much playing out in the marketplace as we expected."

So when we look at trade spending, first to be really clear, and this is important, this a choice we're making as a company. It's a choice to step up the level of in-store merchandising behind things like Burt's Bees or Litter with Febreze because we think, again, we've got great products. And if we get trial, we get repeat. We've talked to that before. I think in some categories like Glad, what you see is when you -- the commodities come down, the good news is you get a bit of a tailwind in margin, but we also tend to see a bit more money go into the market and what we tend to do is adjust our trade spending up and down to reflect that in selected categories. So I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do 2 things: one, if commodity start to recover, and we don't think that will happen in the short term, but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending in commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D. The key for us is to invest for profitable growth and just stay true to the 2020 Strategy. So again, I think we feel good about the choices we're making today, but we retain the flexibility to make different choices in the future as the markets evolve."

Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit.
Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights in our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '16. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So turning to our top line results. In the second quarter, volume grew 1%, and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 3%, and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. 
Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our international business on a currency neutral basis. Market share in the U.S., during the quarter, increased 1/10 of a point versus the year-ago period up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. 
We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the 6-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period. 
Looking at our categories, 5 of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. 
As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working. 
And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season to date. 
Building on our Cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, we began shipping 3 new Clorox ScrubSingle items in December: heavy duty, decide a size and multipurpose. These items build on previously launched new products such as Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers, which have done particularly well in market. 
Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox Bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-less product line. Splash-less bleach is a trade up from our regular product, and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin-accretive product helping to drive profitable growth.
Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business, which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year '16, we continue to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly. 
Switching to the Household segment. We delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags and Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped the price increase taken in November of 2014 and also increased trade promotion spending. Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. 
In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze, and we're also launching 2 new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category. 
Turning to Charcoal and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also, at the tail end of the quarter, we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal offerings with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. 
Turning to Cat Litter. In second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf, and advertising starts in a few days. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Sales grew 2%, with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in Food, partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales on our food business grew solidly behind our ""ranch with"" bottled salad dressings, such as ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December, we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media, and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns. 
On our Burt's Bees business, sales grew double digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, and new mint cocoa and caramel apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter. 
Lastly, in International, sales declined 7%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially, across all markets. However, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins.
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of the fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."

Well, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, we grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the international segment on a currency neutral basis. Importantly, we continued to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in 5 years, which helped mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about 3 points, offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel; 130 basis points of cost savings; and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter.
Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continue to increase total demand-building investments to support our brands. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. 
Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth, offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. 
Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands. We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International, due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. 
On a currency neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about 3 points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing International economies and about 3 points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories. 
We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in International markets and weaker currencies.
In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings pipeline and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83.
In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Benno."

Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year. 
And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy and our outlook for the second half. First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments, and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments, translated to U.S. market share and category growth. 
Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth, and we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than 5 years. 
Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work, and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2. And while still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy. 
In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the 4 pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares. So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. 
And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. 
We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selected categories. And I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business, while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. 
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

I think you're going to see a split of that investment. Some's going to go into trade promotion spending, and then I think some is going to go into advertising. To dimensionalize it, over the long term, we talk about advertising being at this 9% to 10% of sales level. I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year, and a lot of this is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products.

So you're going to see us continue to lean in on both the innovation as well as some of our base products, and then the spend should start to ramp up as you move through the second half of the fiscal year."

We do anticipate, on a full year basis, gross margin will be up about a point, could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out, but it's likely to be flattish in the second half. And the reason for that is a couple of fold. First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal '15, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit. So we're certainly comping that, and actually holding on to those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spending, and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year. And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half, again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal '15. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins.

First, starting with Argentina. Argentina represents about 4% of our sales.

So I think on a go-forward basis, Argentina's probably something like 3% to 4% of our sales, not the largest part of our business. And I would say, just related to the devaluation of Argentina, we anticipated it. It's unfolding about as we had expected. I do think in the second half of the fiscal year and probably for calendar '16, Argentina will weigh on results a bit, following the devaluation.

But what happened after that very much as you described is that gross margins were a little bit more challenged, and I get that. You have to put more back into trade spend. You have to invest in the commodity -- Steve, as you said back into the business. And so that I get, your guidance going forward, and it feels like it'll be next 4 quarters, not just the back half of the year. But what also happened subsequent was that your top line fell quite flat. That was a very different time frame, arguably, but really it was like a 2-point drop in your top line growth as you had to spend back perhaps more than anticipated into the business from commodities. So it wasn't just a gross margin issue, it was also the top line started to slow. And I ask -- I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward, and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slow down dramatically as well as it has done when you've kind of exited this sweet spot of commodities and pricing."

I'm very happy you liked it, and that's very consistent with the initial consumer response that we get and certainly also the response from our customers. This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees, where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago. And we're investing behind lipsticks, but also the base business to keep it that way. Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to, $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compared to some of the more expensive brands out there this delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive, and we'll continue to drive that without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body that we're already in, and we'll continue to have a balanced investment program.

So when we look at trade spending, first to be really clear, and this is important, this a choice we're making as a company. It's a choice to step up the level of in-store merchandising behind things like Burt's Bees or Litter with Febreze because we think, again, we've got great products. And if we get trial, we get repeat. We've talked to that before. I think in some categories like Glad, what you see is when you -- the commodities come down, the good news is you get a bit of a tailwind in margin, but we also tend to see a bit more money go into the market and what we tend to do is adjust our trade spending up and down to reflect that in selected categories. So I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do 2 things: one, if commodity start to recover, and we don't think that will happen in the short term, but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending in commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D. The key for us is to invest for profitable growth and just stay true to the 2020 Strategy. So again, I think we feel good about the choices we're making today, but we retain the flexibility to make different choices in the future as the markets evolve."

Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC.

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 
Now turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance by segment. I'll then turn it over to Steve Robb, who will address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16, Benno will share his perspective on our strategy, results and the acquisition of Renew Life, which we announced earlier today and then after that, we'll take your questions.
So starting with our top line results, the investments we're making on our brands to drive profitable, consistent growth are clearly working. In the third quarter, volume grew 4%, reflecting gains in each of our business segments. Sales increased 2% and that was on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. Excluding foreign currency devaluation, so in other words on a currency-neutral basis, total company sales were up 5%, primarily due to strong volume growth and price increases. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which impacted Clorox in Latin America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
In particular, following the currency devaluation in December in Argentina, a country that represents one of our larger exposures outside of the United States, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40%, resulting in a material foreign exchange headwind through calendar year 2016 and with risk of further devaluation in the future. Looking just at the U.S. Sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in all 3 U.S. segments. 
From a market share standpoint, our U.S. 13-week share increased 2/10 of 1 point versus the year-ago quarter, ending the quarter at 23%. Our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to drive improvement as this was the fifth consecutive quarter -- increased -- quarterly increase in market share. 
Four of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with all-time record shares in Home Care, and strong gains in Charcoal. Our primary opportunities for further improving market share remained in Cat Litter and Water Filtration, and I'm pleased that we have innovation in both supported by significant marketing support. 
In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2.5 points, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of U.S. category growth of greater than 2 points. For perspective, during the recessions several years ago, our categories were only growing between 0 and 1%. 
Turning to international. Our market shares were up 4/10 of 1 point for the 8-month period ending in January. International share growth was particular strong in bleach. In recognizing uncertainty today in many international markets, it's great to see that our choice for investments and profitable opportunities in select international markets are paying off in higher market shares.
So with that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. Third quarter volume and sales each increased a strong 5%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products as well as our Professional Products business. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen across most Clorox-branded products. 
In particular, the relatively mild cold and flu season -- despite the relatively mild cold and flu season, we delivered strong double-digit growth in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as well as all-time records shipments of Clorox Clean-Up bleach-based spray cleaner. Additionally, our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers innovation continues to grow share. And while it's still early, we are pleased with the initial performance of several recently launched ScrubSingles items. These are all great examples that show investments in our Cleaning in the flow growth platform, which emphasizes quick and convenient cleaning are paying off. 
In addition, effective in late March, we regained candid Disinfecting Wipes distribution at Costco, a major customer and a longtime retail partner of Clorox. Although consumption in the club channel is not fully reflected in traditional, external market share reports, this distribution at Costco will be in addition to the greater than 50% market share we have in track channels today within the Disinfecting Wipes segment. This additional distribution add meaningfully to volume over the next year, but also modestly impact margins recognizing the club consumers typically buying a larger size item with a lower-margin profile for manufacturers like Clorox. That said, consumers in the club channel tend to be very loyal to the brands they buy, so we're very said to be able to meet the needs of club channel consumers for disinfecting and Cleaning solutions through this expanded distribution.
Turning to Laundry, sales decreased slightly in the quarter due to continued softness in the color safe bleach category and lower shipments of Clorox regular breach related to our price increase taken in February of 2015. Importantly, however, our focus on Clorox Splash-less bleach continue to drive sales and share growth on this higher-margin business. 
And finally, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products business delivered strong double-digit sales growth. We feel very good about the strength of this business and continue to believe this will be one of the faster-growing businesses in our portfolio going forward.
Turning to the Household segment. We delivered 3% volume and 4% sales growth, driven by strong gains in our Charcoal business. Charcoal's strength was aided by very favorable weather ahead of the main grilling season as well as favorable product and channel mix, as well as distribution of new items, including an easy, new Charcoal items with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. Early season merchandising got off to a strong start at key retailers as evidenced by higher consumption and meaningful share growth. And while we may see a slowdown in the fourth quarter given the very strong results in Q3, our Charcoal business is fundamentally sound and on track to have a strong fiscal year as evidenced by 7% volume growth fiscal year-to-date behind strong fundamental execution with customers and compelling demand building campaigns.
Turning to Bags & Wraps, sales were flat, although this masks the success we continue to have in driving our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, namely driving category trade-up from base trash bags to higher-margin ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. As evidenced, our premium trash bag segment was up high single digits in the third quarter supported in part by our new Glad with Clorox kitchen trash bags featuring antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors as well as the recent launch of 2 new scents of Glad bags with the power of Febreze [ph]. 
It's also worth nothing there are food storage segment made up of Food storage bags, wraps and containers had its second consecutive quarter of solid volume growth and is up 3% in shipments fiscal year-to-date. So all said, we expect the Glad business to have a strong finish to fiscal year '16. 
And in Cat Litter, third quarter sales decreased, primarily due to the timing of promotional spending behind the launch of with Febreze. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial response to this launch and plan to continue investing in demand building activities to drive profitable growth in this highly competitive category.
Looking at our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 4% and sales grew 5%, reflecting sales growth in all 3 businesses, Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration and Food. Starting with our Burt's Bees business, it delivered another quarter of double-digit volume growth behind continued strength in facial towelette; momentum behind recent innovations including new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, as well as a refresh on our lip balms. Burt's Bees Q3 market shares were up in every major segment reflecting the broad-based health of the business.
Turning to our Water Filtration business, sales grew strongly driven by double-digit volume growth, particularly on, on track channels, such as e-commerce. We're continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value. Our demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the national basketball association's most valuable player, kicked off in March with national television ads as well as through digital, PR and social media campaigns. And while it's still early, we feel very good about this partnership.
In our Food business, while the volume decreased slightly, we did see our third consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by the expansion of our ranch with towel dressings. In addition, our focus on innovation in our base ranch flavor drove meaningful share growth on Hidden Valley dressings and dips. Volume on our drive business was up in Q3 driven by the February launch of Greek yogurt dressings and dips. 
And lastly, our acquisitions several years ago with the Asian sauces and marinade continues to pay off as we saw significantly higher volume in Q3 with even higher expectations for Q4. So overall, we feel very good about the direction of our Food business. 
Turning to our last operating segment. International sales dropped 9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with all major markets being impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and particular impact being seen in Argentina, when Clorox is a international markets. As noted a moment ago, following the Argentina currency devaluation in December, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40% and remains at risk of further devaluation going forward. 
Putting that aside, on a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew 9%. Although foreign currency headwinds remain a challenge for us and for other multinationals, we are pleased that our go-in strategy focused on driving margin improvement in international is working and has enabled us to keep margin stable as we focus on driving value in 4 areas, specifically pricing, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand-creation. 
We've also segmented our portfolio -- our international portfolio in fuel and growth businesses as we've done in the U.S and are investing selectively in high-growth opportunity areas. For example, we are stepping up investment in Burt's Bees in markets like Canada, Australia, the U.K., Chile and Mexico. And we're also investing in Laundry initiatives in Latin America and the Middle East. For example, our Clorox clothes laundry innovation is off to a strong start in several international markets. Looking forward, we remain committed to our international business and look forward to improving international margins over time. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date, which reflects the significant investment we've made in our brands. Looking ahead, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of fiscal year '16 to support new products, he also anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. You can look at this investment in 2 main buckets. The first bucket is supporting innovation, including the product launches we've referenced today, namely the offerings of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, premium Glad trash bags as we build on the OdorShield line, fresh Cat Litter with Febreze, several Kingsford Charcoal items, new flavors of ranch with bottled salad dressings and a number of recent Burt's Bees launches, both in the U.S. and in international markets, so that support is all innovation-focused. 
The second bucket of greater investment is protecting our brands from competitive pressures in key categories. For example, we're investing savings from decreased resin cost that defend Glad at the shelf. In Home Care, we're increasing promotions in-store to defend against competitive activity. And we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities behind fresh up Febreze to drive profitable growth in the highly competitive Cat Litter category. 
Looking ahead, as noted in this morning's press release, we raised our sales growth outlook for fiscal year 2016, reflecting our strong results to-date as well as a solid finish anticipated in Q4. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to discuss our Q3 financial performance as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."
89450,329674512,970951,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Well, thanks, Steve and welcome, everyone.

Our updated outlook also includes the announced acquisitio",1226,"Well, thanks, Steve and welcome, everyone. We're certainly pleased with our strong results to-date, including our third quarter performance, which enabled us to raise our fiscal year 2016 outlook. Our updated outlook also includes the announced acquisition of the Renew Life business. I'll address the details behind our full year outlook in just a minute. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 2% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by more than 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency and a little more than 0.5 point of higher trade promotion investment. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 45.3%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities primarily from resin and diesel; 120 basis points of cost savings; and 100 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, primarily driven by higher inflation in international markets. 
Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 14.3% of sales compared with 14.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were also slightly lower on an absolute dollar basis. 
Our advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was up $22 million with total spend more than 10% of sales and it reflects continued strong support for our U.S. business and incremental investments in select higher-margin international businesses including Burt's Bees. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21, a 12% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and higher sales. 
Our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $323 million compared with $398 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments made this fiscal year related to the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance as well as higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. We now anticipate our full year free cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. 
We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5, however, with the recently announced acquisition of Renew Life, we anticipate being at the lower end of our target range by the end of the fiscal year. 
Now I'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook to 1% to 2% growth based on our sales results to-date and we feel good about landing in the mid- to upper end of our range. We continue to anticipate fiscal year 2016 sales to benefit from 3 points of product innovation, moderated by continued slowing international economies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, we now anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5%. 
We now anticipate EBIT margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared to our previous outlook of 50 to 75 basis points. The lower estimate for EBIT margin reflects nearly 25 basis points of impact from the onetime transaction cost and other related acquisition expenses, including the effect of inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization. All other assumptions for EBIT margin remain generally the same, including greater gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting both manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Other factors pressuring EBIT margin continue to include inflation in international markets and weaker foreign currencies, as well as consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. 
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. And we continue to anticipate our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%.
For added context, I'd like to address what we will anticipate for the fourth quarter. First, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we began stepping up our level of advertising investment in the third quarter. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter. And we anticipate advertising spending to be about 12% of sales to support recent innovation, including our Burt's Bees lip colored products and Fresh Step with Febreze Cat Litter. For the full fiscal year, advertising spending is expected to be about 10% of sales, an increase of about 1 point of sales versus year ago. 
Now while this will reduce margins and earnings in the near term, we believe these are the right strategic investments to drive the long-term growth of our core business. 
With respect to the acquisition, we anticipate about 1 point of sales benefit from Renew Life in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we don't expect the business to contribute meaningfully to company's sales until fiscal year 2017 given the acquisition was closed late in fiscal '16. Net of all these factors, we raised our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which includes dilution of about $0.03 to $0.05 from the acquisition. This compares with our previous EPS outlook of $4.75 to $4.90. 
I'd also like to provide additional perspective on the Renew Life acquisition, business rooted in the fast-growing digestive health category and complementary to our global portfolio. This U.S.-centric, bolt-on acquisition is consistent with our strategy to acquire leading brands in fast-growing, midsized health and wellness categories. Over the last several years, Renew Life has enjoyed high single-digit sales increases and gross margins that are generally in line with our company averages. Importantly, we believe the business was acquired for a good price, $290 million or about 2.5x sales. And while this business is anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next year or so as we invest heavily in demand-creation programs and integrate the business into Clorox, we anticipate the business to be EPS neutral to accretive in fiscal year 2018. 
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, we'll be keenly focused on the following things: First, we continue to face a tough business environment in international markets. We anticipate ongoing foreign currency headwinds will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 sales by about 2 points. Second, we plan to continue investing heavily in advertising, consistent with our full year 2016 spending levels to drive awareness and trial of our new products. Our increased investments will help sustain the momentum of our core business in the face of ongoing competitive activity and consumers who remain cautious in their spending. Third, integrating Renew Life into Clorox is a priority and will play strong emphasis on investing in demand-creation and expanding distribution to drive the growth of the business and its categories. In fiscal year '17, we anticipate Renew Life will contribute nearly 2 percentage points to company sales and expect our investments to integrate and fuel the growth of the business, will reduce earnings per share by about $0.05 to $0.07. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance and the ability to continue investing strongly in our core business, while acquiring a leading brand in Renew Life. We remain committed to our long-term strategy to driving profitable growth, including making strategic investments to fuel our innovation programs and our cost savings pipeline. 
Now I'll turn it over to Benno."
89450,329674512,970951,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Steve and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: First, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've be",671,"Thank you, Steve and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: First, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brand behind the strategy accelerators and these investments are working; third, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth, by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds as reflected in the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brand. 
I'd like to share a little perspective on each of these 3 area. The first takeaway. Our Strategy 2020 continues to deliver strong shareholder return. This is certainly evident in our strong Q3 top line growth, reflected by growing market shares in household penetration on key brands in the U.S. On a currency-neutral basis, we're seeing growth in international as well. We have strong gross margin expansion, supporting incremental investments in our brand and we delivered strong earnings per share growth. These results, the health of our businesses, and our overall strong fundamental execution have enabled us to raise our fiscal year sales and earnings outlook. 
The second takeaway. Consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brands behind the strategy accelerators and these investments are working. As discussed earlier in the call, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half to support new product, we anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. 
Now you might ask yourself, why the increased investment and why now? Well, we have strong momentum in our brands as evidenced by a recent result and seek to continue that momentum by investing behind our strategic priorities, in particular, the strong innovation currently market. But we're also continue to support the health of the base business by investing in awareness and trial. And we do like the long-term returns on these investments based on extensive analytics we do across all of our brand investment. So in a nutshell, we're taking the long-term view to invest in driving sustained profitable growth in an environment where such growth is hard to come by. 
And the third takeaway, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds, such as digestive health as reflected by the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brands. We are very excited about the opportunity Renew Life brings to the Clorox portfolio as a leader in health and wellness with an emphasis on digestive health. Through this acquisition, we are expanding into a fast-growing market that aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of brands and midsized categories that are #1 or strong #2 in market share, economically attractive and leverage our core competency.
Renew Life is the #1 brand of probiotics in the natural channel with a steadily growing share in the food, drug and mass channel and probiotics products represent about 2/3 of Renew Life's sale. Digestive health is of growing consumer need and still a highly fragmented category, which provides for an attractive competitive set. The digestive health market in the U.S. represent annual sales of more than $10 billion and is growing at about 7% annually. The probiotics subcategory is about $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. and is expected to grow at 15% per year. This acquisition enables us to expand our health and wellness platform even further. We believe that we have an opportunity to make a difference to the business through our strong 3D brand-building capability. We also believe that Renew Life has scalability and distribution expansion potential in existing and new channels.  So we look forward to building on the strong foundation the Renew Life team has built and bringing the benefits of digestive health products to more consumers, while maintaining a keen focus on the health of our core business. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

You might recall in the third quarter earnings call, we talked about significantly stepping up our consumer demand building investment programs, particularly advertising. You saw that in the third quarter where we invested incrementally about $22 million in advertising and we're going to set step it up again. Part of the timing this year for the advertising investments, it's the reflection of the new product program step-up your level of advertising, you want to have something to talk about and Fresh Step with Febreze, the Burt's Bees lip color launch, these are the things that really leaning and heavy to. So the spending increase is backloaded this year, but it's backloaded consistent with the programs. And then finally, from a return on investment, we do a lot of expense of measuring and tracking and score carding of all of the investments we make and to-date, we've seen very good returns, we're going to continue to lean in and as always, we'll adjust as appropriate as we get new information by at this point, we feel like it's a very good ROI.

Gross margin certainly came in better than we had anticipated in the third quarter. 2 drivers, I would call out, the first is just stronger top line growth for the company. As you know, you get a bit scale advantage when you have stronger growth and we also had some positive mix, we had real strength in some of our businesses like Brita which is higher margin, our Burt's Bees business which is higher margin, so that certainly helped. I would also say commodity costs came in a bit better than we had expected. Now I'm going to caution on that as well because I do think commodity cost is starting to reach a bottom at this point and we found the floor. And we're watching it pretty carefully because I think as you go into the fourth quarter and as we look at our gross margin, we think gross margins are likely to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is, we're starting to lap some of the commodity goodness we saw in the year-ago period, and we're also investing more in consumer demand spend that we talked about earlier. So feel great about the margin expansion for the company, feel good about delivering about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year, but I do think, looking forward, gross margin growth is going to start to slow down as the commodity tailwinds dissipate."

We believe that certainly this acquisition will be attractive for our shareholders as a stand-alone, but we'll certainly also continue to look at this as a potentially broader platform just like we've done, look at Burt's Bees and look at Burt's Bees as a very solid growth model for this where the first trend share value accretion came from distribution expansion, followed by strong investments in the base business to continue to drive what clearly here is fast-growing category based on a growing consumer need, about 2/3 of U.S. consumers have experienced digestive health issues and that trend is expected to continue behind the dietary habits that we're seeing from consumers.

But for the time being, we're focused on driving awareness and trial and distribution on the base product by applying our strong 3D capabilities, which I think are a wonderful fit to add to the great work that the current team has already done in the business."

As you know, Disinfecting Wipes is a business that has been growing share very strongly for us over the last 2 years, frankly. The category also is up 6% over the past 52 weeks and we're clearly leaning into a tailwind on wipes and now, we're happy to have this business back. What I will say in addition to your question, Joe, is importantly, we stay principled as regained this distribution what we commented on 2 years ago was that it is always our aim to stay fair and equitable to all trade customers and ensure that all customers qualify for the same conditions.

And we believe we'll deliver solid additional growth, just on the base. The second opportunity, certainly is an expansion into new categories, and we're very pleased with how lipsticks is going. It's now the #5 lipstick in a very cluttered market and it's overtaking -- over taken some very established and prominent brands. Most recently, lipsticks did received a very prestigious award by Cosmopolitan magazine who called it their favorite lipstick ever. Which certainly is something that we were very pleased to see. And then third, the opportunity continues to be in international and Steve Austenfeld has talked about that earlier in this call where we believe that both in markets that we're already in, as well as in markets that we have a very small presence, there's a lot of opportunity to repeat the success that we've had in the U.S. and we're investing in that. So category expansion will continue to be the name of the game, but it's really part of a three-pronged growth strategy that also includes growth on the base and growth in new countries."

First of all, just basic consumer trends. We've talked to all of you before about the fact that this is a very preferred product form as consumers increasingly clean in the flow versus on their hands and knees, so we're just having a a lot of consumer tailwind. Second, we're fueling those tailwinds with innovation, mostly innovation that increases the versatility of use and allows consumers to use wipes in new places whether that on glass, whether that's on wood, whether that's in bathroom or more recently, put a tougher jobs in the kitchen, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with microscrubbers has been incredibly successful and is growing market share and we're fueling that success with additional investment. And then certainly, the distribution expansion like the one that was talked about will help. So we have high hopes that the we'll continue to see strong growth on wipes in the future.

We are focusing on rebuilding our margins in international with our Go Lean efforts that's something we're also going to continue and we're also focused on taking pricing and high inflationary economy, so I think actions that we're taking should over the very long term, help us deliver EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 bps but you will see variability across the quarters and even across the years at times.

Nonetheless, at this point, we'll take pricing where we need it over the long term. The key for us ultimately is going to be innovation and driving innovation growth. So here's how we think of it over the next couple of years and maybe into fiscal '17. We continue to aspire to deliver 3% to 5% top line sales. Embedded in that is an assumption that our U.S. business grows at 2% to 4%. I will say based on what we're seeing not just with the categories, but importantly, our innovation programs and the investment that we're making, we feel very good about delivering solid growth in this range of 2% to 4% based on what we know today. I think the bigger challenge that we have like many other companies is on the international side where the slowing economies, the FX headwinds, the challenging environment, I think that's likely to weigh on top line sales growth for international in fiscal '17, which is why our efforts to focus on innovation going lean underwrite efforts.

So our company was founded 103 years ago today and it was founded based on disinfecting product and bleach. And over time, whether that's through our Professional Products, through Brita, through Green Works, through Burt's Bees, we have continued to go deeper into health and wellness and this is just another example. So for us, we look at it this as a health and wellness business where our capabilities can make a real difference. First of all, this is the #1 brand in the natural channel, but there's a very significant potential to grow through distribution in food, drug, mass, certainly here in the U.S., but also in Canada and then in international over time. And that's really bull's-eye as it relates to applying Clorox worldwide capabilities. I would hold up our capabilities when it comes to driving distribution against any company in our space, and we've certainly proven that time and time again. We've also proven that in the health and wellness space through brand-building and through innovation, we can make great differences to businesses that we acquire over time, whether that's Burt's Bees or if you reach further back, in Hidden Valley or Brita we pretty much follow the same model, they were pretty small when we bought them, it was new categories when we bought them but we've made an incredible difference and term them into brand powerhouses.

So it will take time to rebuild the margins through pricing. We're doubling down on our cost savings efforts and some of these countries are playing our U.S. given about is there which we think makes good sense. And we're also rightsizing infrastructure investments. Because we don't think the international markets, particularly emerging market are going to continue to be challenging and we want to basically some challenging environment and structure accordingly.

I'd also remind everybody of what we have consistently said in the past and that is that the vast majority of our discussions that we have with Walmart are around growth because that's what they're looking for, and that's what we can bring. So we talk about how we're investing in their categories, we talk about our innovation, their early adopters on many of our innovations and we talk about how we can grow their categories with both investments and innovation and we're doing that well. Right now, again, our business with Walmart remains a very healthy and strong, and we're certainly working our hardest to keep it that way given that they're a major customer. What I feel most positive about is that the premise that we've always talked about that the 2 companies, Walmart and Clorox, are so strongly strategically align, continues to be true whether they're investing benefits our company, whether that's in the improvement of store operations, which certainly helps us for instance by eliminating out of stocks, whether that's by investing in e-commerce which, as you know, is a growth platform for us as well and remains our fastest-growing channel or whether that's -- their investment in smaller formats alike neighborhood markets where they really rely on #1 and #2 brands of which we have so many to drive growth and assortment. So I continue to feel good about our business with Walmart and I feel -- continue to feel good about the progress that we're making based on the focus on how we can grow their categories with our innovation and with our demand spend."

Now turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance by segment. I'll then turn it over to Steve Robb, who will address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16, Benno will then share his perspective on our strategy, results and the acquisition of Renew Life, which we announced earlier today and then after that, we'll take your questions.
So starting with our top line results, the investments we're making on our brands to drive profitable, consistent growth are clearly working. In the third quarter, volume grew 4%, reflecting gains in each of our business segments. Sales increased 2% and that was on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. Excluding foreign currency devaluation, so in other words on a currency-neutral basis, total company sales were up 5%, primarily due to strong volume growth and price increases. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which impacted Clorox in Latin America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In particular, following the currency devaluation in December in Argentina, a country that represents one of our larger exposures outside of the United States, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40%, resulting in a material foreign exchange headwind through calendar year 2016 and with risk of further devaluation in the future. Looking just at the U.S. Sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in all 3 U.S. segments.
From a market share standpoint, our U.S. 13-week share increased 2/10 of 1 point versus the year-ago quarter, ending the quarter at 23%. Our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to drive improvement as this was the fifth consecutive quarter -- increase -- quarterly increase in market share.
Four of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with all-time record shares in Home Care, and strong gains in Charcoal. Our primary opportunities for further improving market share remain in Cat Litter and Water Filtration, and I'm pleased that we have innovation in both supported by significant marketing support.
In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2.5 points, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of U.S. category growth of greater than 2 points. For perspective, during the recession several years ago, our categories were only growing between 0 and 1%.
Turning to international. Our market shares were up 4/10 of 1 point for the 8-month period ending in January. International share growth was particular strong in bleach. In recognizing uncertainty today in many international markets, it's great to see that our choice for investments and profitable opportunities in select international markets are paying off in higher market shares.
So with that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. Third quarter volume and sales each increased a strong 5%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products as well as our Professional Products business. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen across most Clorox-branded products.
In particular, the relatively mild cold and flu season -- despite the relatively mild cold and flu season, we delivered strong double-digit growth in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as well as all-time records shipments of Clorox Clean-Up, bleach-based spray cleaner. Additionally, our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro-Scrubbers innovation continues to grow share. And while it's still early, we are pleased with the initial performance of several recently launched ScrubSingles items. These are all great examples that show investments in our Cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, which emphasizes quick and convenient cleaning are paying off.
In addition, effective in late March, we regained Disinfecting Wipes distribution at Costco, a major Clorox customer and a longtime retail partner of Clorox. Although consumption in the club channel is not fully reflected in traditional, external market share reports, this distribution at Costco will be in addition to the greater than 50% market share we have in track channels today, within the Disinfecting Wipes segment. This additional distribution add meaningfully to volume over the next year, but also modestly impact margins recognizing the club consumers typically buying a larger size item with a lower-margin profile for manufacturers like Clorox. That said, consumers in the club channel tend to be very loyal to the brands they buy, so we're very said to be able to meet the needs of club channel consumers for disinfecting and cleaning solutions through this expanded distribution.
Turning to Laundry. Sales decreased slightly in the quarter due to continued softness in the color-safe bleach category and lower shipments of Clorox -- Regular Clorox Bleach related to our price increase taken in February of 2015. Importantly, however, our focus on Clorox Splash-less bleach continues to drive sales and share growth on this higher-margin business.
And finally, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products business delivered strong double-digit sales growth. We feel very good about the strength of this business and continue to believe this will be one of the faster-growing businesses in our portfolio going forward.
Turning to the Household segment. We delivered 3% volume and 4% sales growth, driven by strong gains in our Charcoal business. Charcoal's strength was aided by very favorable weather, ahead of the main grilling season, as well as favorable product and channel mix, as well as distribution of new items, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal items with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. Early season merchandising got off to a strong start at key retailers as evidenced by higher consumption and meaningful share growth. And while we may see a slowdown in the fourth quarter, given the very strong results in Q3, our Charcoal business is fundamentally sound and on track to have a strong fiscal year as evidenced by 7% volume growth fiscal year-to-date behind strong fundamental execution with customers and compelling demand building campaigns.
Turning to Bags & Wraps, sales were flat, although this masks the success we continue to have in driving our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, namely driving category trade-up from base trash bags to higher-margin ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. As evidenced, our premium trash bag segment was up high single digits in the third quarter supported in part by our new Glad with Clorox kitchen trash bags featuring antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors as well as the recent launch of 2 new scents of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze.
It's also worth nothing there are food storage segments made up of food storage bags, wraps and containers had its second consecutive quarter of solid volume growth and is up 3% in shipments fiscal year-to-date. So all said, we expect the Glad business to have a strong finish to fiscal year '16. 
And in Cat Litter, third quarter sales decreased, primarily due to the timing of promotional spending behind the launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial response to this launch and plan to continue investing in demand building activities to drive profitable growth in this highly competitive category.
Looking at our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 4% and sales grew 5%, reflecting sales growth in all 3 businesses, Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration and Food. Starting with our Burt's Bees business, it delivered another quarter of double-digit volume growth behind continued strength in facial towelette; momentum behind recent innovations including new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, as well as a refresh on our tinted lip balms. Burt's Bees Q3 market shares were up in every major segment reflecting the broad-based health of the business.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales grew strongly driven by double-digit volume growth, particularly in on track channels, such as e-commerce. We're continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value. Our demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player, kicked off in March with national television ads as well as through digital, PR and social media campaigns. And while it's still early, we feel very good about this partnership.
In our Food business, while volume decreased slightly, we did see our third consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by the expansion of our ranch with bottled towel dressings. In addition, our focus on innovation in our base ranch flavor drove meaningful share growth on Hidden Valley dressings and dips. Volume on our drive business was up in Q3 driven by the February launch of Greek yogurt dressings and dips.
And lastly, our acquisitions several years ago with Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinade continues to pay off, as we saw significantly higher volume in Q3 with even higher expectations for Q4. So overall, we feel very good about the direction of our Food business.
Turning to our last operating segment. International sales dropped 9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with all major markets being impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and particular impact being seen in Argentina, one of Clorox's bigger international markets. As noted a moment ago, following the Argentina currency devaluation in December, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40% and remains at risk of further devaluation going forward.
Putting that aside, on a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew 9%. Although foreign currency headwinds remain a challenge for us and for other multinationals, we are pleased that our go-in strategy focused on driving margin improvement in international is working and has enabled us to keep margin stable as we focus on driving value in 4 areas, specifically pricing, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand-creation.
We've also segmented our portfolio -- our international portfolio into fuel and growth businesses, as we've done in the U.S, and are investing selectively in high-growth opportunity areas. For example, we are stepping up investment in Burt's Bees in markets like Canada, Australia, the U.K., Chile and Mexico. And we're also investing in Laundry initiatives in Latin America and the Middle East. For example, our Clorox2, color-safe laundry additive innovation is off to a strong start in several international markets. Looking forward, we remain committed to our international business and look forward to improving international margins over time.
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date, which reflects the significant investment we've made in our brands. Looking ahead, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of fiscal year '16 to support new products, we also anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. You can look at this investment in 2 main buckets. The first bucket is supporting innovation, including the product launches we've referenced today, namely new offerings of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, premium Glad trash bags as we build on the OdorShield line, fresh Cat Litter with Febreze, several Kingsford Charcoal items, new flavors of ranch with bottled salad dressings and a number of recent Burt's Bees launches, both in the U.S. and in international markets, so that support is all innovation-focused.
The second bucket of greater investment is protecting our brands from competitive pressures in key categories. For example, we're investing savings from decreased resin cost that defend Glad at the shelf. In Home Care, we're increasing promotions in-store to defend against competitive activity. And we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities behind Fresh Step with Febreze to drive profitable growth in the highly competitive Cat Litter category.
Looking ahead, as noted in this morning's press release, we've raised our sales growth outlook for fiscal year 2016, reflecting our strong results to-date as well as a solid finish anticipated in Q4.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to discuss our Q3 financial performance as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."
89450,329674512,971484,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're certainly pleased with our strong results to-date, including our third quarter performance, which enabled us to raise our fiscal year 2016 outlook.

We're certainly pleased with our strong results to-date, including our third quarter performance, which enabled us to raise our fiscal year 2016 outlook. Our updated outlook also includes the announced acquisition of the Renew Life business. I'll address the details behind our full year outlook in just a minute. 
First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 2% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by more than 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency and a little more than 0.5 point of higher trade promotion investment.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 45.3%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities primarily from resin and diesel; 120 basis points of cost savings; and 100 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, primarily driven by higher inflation in international markets.
Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 14.3% of sales compared with 14.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were also slightly lower on an absolute dollar basis.
Our advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was up $22 million with total spend more than 10% of sales and it reflects continued strong support for our U.S. business and incremental investments in select higher-margin international businesses including Burt's Bees. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21, a 12% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and higher sales.
Our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $323 million compared with $398 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments made this fiscal year related to the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance as well as higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. We now anticipate our full year free cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales.
We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. However, with the recently announced acquisition of Renew Life, we anticipate being at the lower end of our target range by the end of the fiscal year.
Now I'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook to 1% to 2% growth based on our sales results to-date, and we feel good about landing in the mid- to upper end of our range. We continue to anticipate fiscal year 2016 sales to benefit from 3 points of product innovation, moderated by continued slowing international economies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, we now anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5%.
We now anticipate EBIT margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared to our previous outlook of 50 to 75 basis points. The lower estimate for EBIT margin reflects nearly 25 basis points of impact from the onetime transaction cost and other related acquisition expenses, including the effect of inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization. All other assumptions for EBIT margin remain generally the same, including greater gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting both manufacturing and logistics costs.
Other factors pressuring EBIT margin continue to include inflation in international markets and weaker foreign currencies, as well as consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands.
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. And we continue to anticipate our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%.
For added context, I'd like to address what we will anticipate for the fourth quarter. First, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we began stepping up our level of advertising investment in the third quarter. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter. And we anticipate advertising spending to be about 12% of sales to support recent innovation, including our Burt's Bees lip colored products and Fresh Step with Febreze Cat Litter. For the full fiscal year, advertising spending is expected to be about 10% of sales, an increase of about 1 point of sales versus year ago. 
Now while this will reduce margins and earnings in the near term, we believe these are the right strategic investments to drive the long-term growth of our core business.
With respect to the acquisition, we anticipate about a point of sales benefit from Renew Life in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we don't expect the business to contribute meaningfully to company's sales until fiscal year 2017, given the acquisition was closed late in fiscal '16. Net of all these factors, we raised our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which includes dilution of about $0.03 to $0.05 from the acquisition. This compares with our previous EPS outlook of $4.75 to $4.90.
I'd also like to provide additional perspective on the Renew Life acquisition, business rooted in the fast-growing digestive health category and complementary to our global portfolio. This U.S.-centric, bolt-on acquisition is consistent with our strategy to acquire leading brands in fast-growing, midsized health and wellness categories. Over the last several years, Renew Life has enjoyed high single-digit sales increases and gross margins that are generally in line with our company averages. Importantly, we believe the business was acquired for a good price, $290 million or about 2.5x sales. And while this business is anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next year or so, as we invest heavily in demand-creation programs and integrate the business into Clorox. We anticipate the business to be EPS neutral to accretive in fiscal year 2018.
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, we'll be keenly focused on the following things. 
First, we continue to face a tough business environment in international markets. We anticipate ongoing foreign currency headwinds will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 sales by about 2 points. 
Second, we plan to continue investing heavily in advertising, consistent with our full year 2016 spending levels to drive awareness and trial of our new products. Our increased investments will help sustain the momentum of our core business in the face of ongoing competitive activity and consumers who remain cautious in their spending. 
Third, integrating Renew Life into Clorox is a priority and will play strong emphasis on investing in demand-creation and expanding distribution to drive the growth of the business and its categories. 
In fiscal year '17, we anticipate Renew Life will contribute nearly 2 percentage points to company sales and expect our investments to integrate and fuel the growth of the business, will reduce earnings per share by about $0.05 to $0.07.
In closing, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance and the ability to continue investing strongly in our core business, while acquiring a leading brand in Renew Life. We remain committed to our long-term strategy to driving profitable growth, including making strategic investments to fuel our innovation programs and our cost savings pipeline.
Now I'll turn it over to Benno."
89450,329674512,971484,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: first, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've b",672,"Thank you, Steve, and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: first, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brand behind the strategy accelerators and these investments are working; third, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth, by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds as reflected in the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brand.
I'd like to share a little perspective on each of these 3 areas. The first takeaway. Our Strategy 2020 continues to deliver strong shareholder return. This is certainly evident in our strong Q3 top line growth, reflected by growing market shares in household penetration on key brands in the U.S. On a currency-neutral basis, we're seeing growth in international as well. We have strong gross margin expansion, supporting incremental investments in our brand and we delivered strong earnings per share growth. These results, the health of our businesses, and our overall strong fundamental execution have enabled us to raise our fiscal year sales and earnings outlook. 
The second takeaway. Consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brands behind the strategy accelerators and these investments are working. As discussed earlier in the call, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half to support new product, we anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. 
Now you might ask yourself, why the increased investment and why now? Well, we have strong momentum on our brands as evidenced by a recent result and seek to continue that momentum by investing behind our strategic priorities, in particular, the strong innovation currently in market. But we're also continuing to support the health of the base business by investing in awareness and trial. And we do like the long-term returns on these investments based on extensive analytics we do across all of our brand investment. So in a nutshell, we're taking the long-term view to invest in driving sustained profitable growth in an environment where such growth is hard to come by.
And the third takeaway, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds, such as digestive health as reflected by the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brand. We are very excited about the opportunity Renew Life brings to the Clorox portfolio as a leader in health and wellness with an emphasis on digestive health. Through this acquisition, we are expanding into a fast-growing market that aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of brands and midsized categories that are #1 or strong #2 in market share, economically attractive and leverage our core competency.
Renew Life is the #1 brand of probiotics in the natural channel, with a steadily growing share in the food, drug and mass channel. And probiotics products represent about 2/3 of Renew Life's sale. Digestive health is a growing consumer need and still a highly fragmented category, which provides for an attractive competitive set. The digestive health market in the U.S. represents annual sales of more than $10 billion and is growing at about 7% annually. The probiotics subcategory is about $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. and is expected to grow at 15% per year. This acquisition enables us to expand our health and wellness platform even further. We believe that we have an opportunity to make a difference to the business through our strong 3D brand-building capability. We also believe that Renew Life has scalability and distribution expansion potential in existing and new channels.  So we look forward to building on the strong foundation the Renew Life team has built and bringing the benefits of digestive health products to more consumers, while maintaining a keen focus on the health of our core business. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

You might recall in the third quarter earnings call, we talked about significantly stepping up our consumer demand building investment programs, particularly advertising. You saw that in the third quarter where we invested incrementally about $22 million in advertising, and we're going to step it up again. Part of the timing this year for the advertising investments, it's the reflection of the new product program to kind of step-up your level of advertising, you want to have something to talk about and Fresh Step with Febreze, the Burt's Bees lip color launch, these are the things that really leaning and heavy to. So the spending increase is backloaded this year, but it backloaded consistent with the programs. And then finally, from a return on investment, we do a lot of extensive measuring and tracking and score carding of all of the investments we make in. Today, we've seen very good returns, we're going to continue to lean in and as always, we'll adjust as appropriate as we get new information by at this point, we feel like it's a very good ROI. But keep in mind, the investments we make in the fourth quarter, most of the benefit will, I think, be in future years as you get awareness and trial on those new products."

And again, part of the reason that you're not seeing more accretion earlier, this is a business that's been growing high single digits, again, it's got attractive margins. Just like we did with the Burt's Bees many years ago, we went to fuel that growth, so we're going to be stepping up the level of consumer demand-building investments over the next couple of years, particularly as we expand the disruption across the U.S. So that's the #1 reason.

Gross margin, certainly came in better than we had anticipated in the third quarter. Two drivers, I would call out, the first is just stronger top line growth for the company. As you know, you get a bit scale advantage when you have stronger growth, and we also had some positive mix. We had real strength in some of our businesses like Brita, which is higher margin. Our Burt's Bees business, which is higher margin. So that certainly helped. I would also say commodity costs came in a bit better than we had expected. Now I'm going to caution on that as well because I do think commodity cost is starting to reach a bottom at this point unlike we found in the floor. And we're watching it pretty carefully because I think as you go into the fourth quarter and as we look at our gross margin, we think gross margins are likely to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is, we're starting to lap some of the commodity goodness we saw in the year-ago period. And we're also investing more in consumer demand spend that we talked about earlier. So feel great about the margin expansion for the company, feel good about delivering about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year, but I do think, looking forward, gross margin growth is going to start to slow down as the commodity tailwinds dissipate."

We believe that certainly this acquisition will be attractive for our shareholders as a stand-alone, but we'll certainly also continue to look at this as a potentially broader platform just like we've done with Burt's Bees. I look at Burt's Bees as a very solid growth model for this where the first tranche of value accretion came from distribution expansion, followed by strong investments in the base business to continue to drive what clearly here is fast-growing category based on a growing consumer need, about 2/3 of U.S. consumers have experienced digestive health issues and that trend is expected to continue behind the dietary habits that we're seeing from consumers. So investing in awareness and trial on the base product, certainly is the second opportunity here. And then the third opportunity is to look at adjacent spaces around whether that's organically or perhaps through additional business development activity and perhaps that will yield an opportunity to add additional growth down the road. But for the time being, we're focused on driving awareness and trial and distribution on the base product by applying our strong 3D capabilities, which I think are a wonderful fit to add to the great work that the current team has already done on the business."

The category also is up 6% over the past 52 weeks, and we're clearly leaning into a tailwind on wipes. And now, we're happy to have this business back.

And we're driving that through tactics like TV advertising which we, for the first time, did last year and which we'll do again this year. And believe we'll deliver solid additional growth, just on the base. The second opportunity, certainly is an expansion into new categories, and we're very pleased with how lipstick is going. It's now the #5 lipstick in a very cluttered market, and it's overtaking -- over taken some very established and prominent brands. Most recently, lipsticks did receive a very prestigious award by Cosmopolitan magazine who called it their favorite lipstick ever. Which certainly is something that we were very pleased to see. And then third, the opportunity continues to be in international and Steve Austenfeld has talked about that earlier in this call where we believe that both in markets that we're already in, as well as in markets that we have a very small presence, there's a lot of opportunity to repeat the success that we've had in the U.S. and we're investing in that.

So I think the actions that we're taking should, over the very long term, help us deliver EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 bps, but you will see variability across the quarters and even across the years at times. But I do feel good about the programs we have in place to not just keep the margins healthy, but build them over the very long term."

Again, what we've said is, we'll price to recover inflation and do our -- protect our margins over the long term, so we would prefer not to take pricing given the consumer remains at a fragile condition. Nonetheless, at this point, we'll take pricing where we need it over the long term. The key for us, ultimately, is going to be innovation and driving innovation growth. So here's how we think of it over the next couple of years and maybe into fiscal '17. We continue to aspire to deliver 3% to 5% top line sales growth. Now embedded in that is an assumption that our U.S. business grows at 2% to 4%. I will say based on what we're seeing not just with the categories, but importantly, our innovation programs and the investment that we're making, we feel very good about delivering solid growth in this range of 2% to 4% based on what we know today. I think the bigger challenge that we have like many other companies is on the international side where the slowing economies, the FX headwinds, the challenging environment, I think that's likely to weigh on top line sales growth for international in fiscal '17, which is why our efforts to focus on innovation going lean are the right efforts. So on balance, I feel like we are doing a pretty good job as a company. We've got solid plans that we are building now for fiscal '17, and we'll provide additional color on the August call."

So first of all, if I look at just the basic category, fundamentally we're a health and wellness company. So our company was founded 103 years ago today, and it was founded based on disinfecting product and bleach. And over time, whether that's through our Professional Products, through Brita, through Green Works, through Burt's Bees, we have continued to go deeper into health and wellness and this is just another example. So for us, we look at this as a health and wellness business where our capabilities can make a real difference. First of all, this is the #1 brand in the natural channel, but there's a very significant potential to grow through distribution in food, drug, mass, certainly here in the U.S., but also in Canada and then in international over time. And that's really bull's-eye as it relates to applying Clorox world-class capabilities. I would hold up our capabilities when it comes to driving distribution against any company in our space, and we've certainly proven that at time and time again. We've also proven that in the health and wellness space through brand-building and through innovation, we can make great differences to businesses that we acquire over time, whether that's Burt's Bees or if you reach further back, Hidden Valley or Brita, we pretty much follow the same model, they were pretty small when we bought them, they were new categories for us when we bought them, but we've made an incredible difference and turned them into brand powerhouses. And as we evaluate it, this base which we're very familiar with through extensive diligence and as we evaluated the fit with our own capabilities, we got to a space where we felt that we're very comfortable that we are not just buying a business that is profitable and in a fast-growing category, but one that we can make significant difference, too."

And I think you'll see us continue to invest at that level of consumer demand-building investment at least for advertising over time.

We've got a very good track record of taking pricing and importantly keeping the pricing that we take and keeping our brands healthy. As much as we would love to be able to price recover all of the FX and inflation, you have to take a measured approach with the consumer so that you do it in a sustainable way. So I would say that as inflation and FX squeezed margins, particularly in Argentina and some of these larger countries, we are taking pricing, it is sticking but we're trying to do it over time. So it will take time to rebuild the margins through pricing. We're doubling down on our cost savings efforts and some of these countries are applying our U.S. capabilities there, which we think makes good sense. And we're also rightsizing the infrastructure investments. Because we do think the international markets, particularly emerging markets, are going to continue to be challenging. And we want to basically assume a challenging environment and structure accordingly. So I think it's going to take time for us to rebuild the international margins. So I do think international will challenge our results in fiscal '17. But I can also say that I think we're putting in the right long-term plan in executing those well to create a healthy growing international business for the long term."

And we talk about how we can grow their categories with both investments and innovation, and we're doing that well. Right now, again, our business with Walmart remains a very healthy and strong, and we're certainly working our hardest to keep it that way given that they're major customers. What I feel most positive about is that the premise that we've always talked about that the 2 companies, Walmart and Clorox, are so strongly strategically aligned, continues to be true. Where they're investing benefits our company, whether that's in the improvement of store operations, which certainly helps us, for instance, by eliminating out of stocks. Whether that's by investing in e-commerce which, as you know, is a growth platform for us as well and remains our fastest-growing channel. Or whether that's -- their investment in smaller formats like neighborhood markets where they really rely on #1 and #2 brands of which we have so many to drive growth and assortment. So I continue to feel good about our business with Walmart and I feel -- continue to feel good about the progress that we're making based on the focus on how we can grow their categories with our innovation and with our demand spend."

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Now turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance by segment. I'll then turn it over to Steve Robb, who will address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '16, Benno will then share his perspective on our strategy, results and the acquisition of Renew Life, which we announced earlier today and then after that, we'll take your questions.
So starting with our top line results, the investments we're making on our brands to drive profitable, consistent growth are clearly working. In the third quarter, volume grew 4%, reflecting gains in each of our business segments. Sales increased 2%, and that was on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. Excluding foreign currency devaluation, so in other words on a currency-neutral basis, total company sales were up 5%, primarily due to strong volume growth and price increases. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which impacted Clorox in Latin America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In particular, following the currency devaluation in December in Argentina, a country that represents one of our larger exposures outside of the United States, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40%, resulting in a material foreign exchange headwind through calendar year 2016 and with risk of further devaluation in the future. Looking just at the U.S., sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in all 3 U.S. segments.
From a market share standpoint, our U.S. 13-week share increased 2/10 of 1 point versus the year-ago quarter, ending the quarter at 23%. Our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to drive improvement as this was the fifth consecutive quarter -- increase -- quarterly increase in market share.
Four of our 8 U.S. Retail business units increased market share with all-time record shares in Home Care, and strong gains in Charcoal. Our primary opportunities for further improving market share remain in Cat Litter and Water Filtration, and I'm pleased that we have innovation in both supported by significant marketing support.
In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2.5 points, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of U.S. category growth of greater than 2 points. For perspective, during the recession several years ago, our categories were only growing between 0 and 1%.
Turning to international. Our market shares were up 4/10 of 1 point for the 8-month period ending in January. International share growth was particular strong in bleach. In recognizing uncertainty today in many international markets, it's great to see that our choice-ful investments and profitable opportunities in select international markets are paying off in higher market shares.
So with that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. Third quarter volume and sales each increased a strong 5%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products as well as our Professional Products business. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen across most Clorox-branded products.
In particular, the relatively mild cold and flu season -- despite the relatively mild cold and flu season, we delivered strong double-digit growth in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as well as all-time records shipments of Clorox Clean-Up bleach-based spray cleaner. Additionally, our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro-Scrubbers innovation continues to grow share. And while it's still early, we are pleased with the initial performance of several recently launched ScrubSingles items. These are all great examples that show investments in our Cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, which emphasizes quick and convenient cleaning are paying off.
In addition, effective in late March, we regained Disinfecting Wipes distribution at Costco, a major club customer and a longtime retail partner of Clorox. Although consumption in the club channel is not fully reflected in traditional external market share reports, this distribution at Costco will be in addition to the greater than 50% market share we have in track channels today within the Disinfecting Wipes segment. This additional distribution will add meaningfully to volume over the next year, but also modestly impact margins recognizing the club consumer is typically buying a larger size item with a lower-margin profile for manufacturers like Clorox. That said, consumers in the club channel tend to be very loyal to the brands they buy, so we're very excited to be able to meet the needs of club channel consumers for disinfecting and cleaning solutions through this expanded distribution.
Turning to Laundry. Sales decreased slightly in the quarter due to continued softness in the color-safe bleach category and lower shipments of Clorox -- Regular Clorox Bleach related to our price increase taken in February of 2015. Importantly, however, our focus on Clorox Splash-less bleach continues to drive sales and share growth on this higher-margin business.
And finally, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products business delivered strong double-digit sales growth. We feel very good about the strength of this business and continue to believe this will be one of the faster-growing businesses in our portfolio going forward.
Turning to the Household segment. We delivered 3% volume and 4% sales growth, driven by strong gains in our Charcoal business. Charcoal's strength was aided by very favorable weather ahead of the main grilling season, as well as favorable product and channel mix, as well as distribution of new items, including an easy light bag, new Charcoal items with Hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. Early season merchandising got off to a strong start at key retailers as evidenced by higher consumption and meaningful share growth. And while we may see a slowdown in the fourth quarter given the very strong results in Q3, our Charcoal business is fundamentally sound and on track to have a strong fiscal year as evidenced by 7% volume growth fiscal year-to-date behind strong fundamental execution with customers and compelling demand-building campaigns.
Turning to Bags & Wraps, sales were flat, although this masks the success we continue to have in driving our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, namely driving category trade-up from base trash bags to higher-margin ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. As evidence, our premium trash bag segment was up high single digits in the third quarter supported in part by our new Glad with Clorox kitchen trash bags featuring antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors as well as the recent launch of 2 new scents of Glad OdorShield bags with the power of Febreze.
It's also worth nothing there our food storage segments made up of food storage bags, wraps and containers had its second consecutive quarter of solid volume growth and is up 3% in shipments fiscal year-to-date. So all said, we expect the Glad business to have a strong finish to fiscal year '16. 
And in Cat Litter, third quarter sales decreased, primarily due to the timing of promotional spending behind the launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial response to this launch and plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive profitable growth in this highly competitive category.
Looking at our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 4% and sales grew 5%, reflecting sales growth in all 3 businesses: Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration and Food. Starting with our Burt's Bees business, it delivered another quarter of double-digit volume growth behind continued strength in facial towelette; momentum behind recent innovations including new lipsticks, blemish balm cream also known as BB Cream, as well as a refresh on our tinted lip balms. Burt's Bees Q3 market shares were up in every major segment reflecting the broad-based health of the business.
Turning to our Brita water filtration business, sales grew strongly driven by double-digit volume growth, particularly in on-track channels such as e-commerce. We're continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value. Our demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player, kicked off in March with national television ads as well as through digital, PR and social media campaigns. And while it's still early, we feel very good about this partnership.
In our Food business, while volume decreased slightly, we did see our third consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by the expansion of our ranch with bottled salad dressings. In addition, our focus on innovation in our base ranch flavor drove meaningful share growth on Hidden Valley dressings and dips. Volume on our dry business was up in Q3 driven by the February launch of Greek yogurt dressings and dips.
And lastly, our acquisitions several years ago with Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinade continues to pay off, as we saw significantly higher volume in Q3 with even higher expectations for Q4. So overall, we feel very good about the direction of our Food business.
Turning to our last operating segment. International sales dropped 9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with all major markets being impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and particular impact being seen in Argentina, one of Clorox's bigger international markets. As noted a moment ago, following the Argentina currency devaluation in December, the Argentine peso was down roughly 40% and remains at risk of further devaluation going forward.
Putting that aside, on a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew 9%. Although foreign currency headwinds remain a challenge for us and for other multinationals, we are pleased that our going strategy focused on driving margin improvement in international is working and has enabled us to keep margin stable as we focus on driving value in 4 areas, specifically pricing, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation.
We've also segmented our portfolio -- our international portfolio into fuel and growth businesses, as we've done in the U.S, and are investing selectively in high-growth opportunity areas. For example, we are stepping up investment in Burt's Bees in markets like Canada, Australia, the U.K., Chile and Mexico. And we're also investing in Laundry initiatives in Latin America and the Middle East. For example, our Clorox clothes color-safe laundry additive innovation is off to a strong start in several international markets. Looking forward, we remain committed to our international business and look forward to improving international margins over time.
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date, which reflects the significant investment we've made in our brands. Looking ahead, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of fiscal year '16 to support new products, we also anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. You can look at this investment in 2 main buckets. The first bucket is supporting innovation, including the product launches we've referenced today, namely new offerings of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, premium Glad trash bags as we build on the OdorShield line, fresh Cat Litter with Febreze, several Kingsford Charcoal items, new flavors of ranch with bottled salad dressings and a number of recent Burt's Bees launches, both in the U.S. and in international markets, so that support is all innovation-focused.
The second bucket of greater investment is protecting our brands from competitive pressures in key categories. For example, we're investing savings from decreased resin cost to defend Glad at the shelf. In Home Care, we're increasing promotions in-store to defend against competitive activity. And we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities behind Fresh Step with Febreze to drive profitable growth in the highly competitive Cat Litter category.
Looking ahead, as noted in this morning's press release, we've raised our sales growth outlook for fiscal year 2016, reflecting our strong results to-date as well as a solid finish anticipated in Q4.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to discuss our Q3 financial performance as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2016."

Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 45.3%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities primarily from resin and diesel, 120 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, primarily driven by higher inflation in international markets.
Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 14.3% of sales compared with 14.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were also slightly lower on an absolute dollar basis.
Our advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was up $22 million with total spend more than 10% of sales, and it reflects continued strong support for our U.S. business and incremental investments in select higher-margin international businesses including Burt's Bees. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21, a 12% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and higher sales.
Our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $323 million compared with $398 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments made this fiscal year related to the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance as well as higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. We now anticipate our full year free cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales.
We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8, below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. However, with the recently announced acquisition of Renew Life, we anticipate being at the lower end of our target range by the end of the fiscal year.
Now I'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook to 1% to 2% growth based on our sales results to-date, and we feel good about landing in the mid- to upper end of our range. We continue to anticipate fiscal year 2016 sales to benefit from 3 points of product innovation, moderated by continued slowing international economies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, we now anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5%.
We now anticipate EBIT margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared to our previous outlook of 50 to 75 basis points. The lower estimate for EBIT margin reflects nearly 25 basis points of impact from the onetime transaction cost and other related acquisition expenses, including the effect of inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization. All other assumptions for EBIT margin remain generally the same, including greater gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting both manufacturing and logistics costs.
Other factors pressuring EBIT margin continue to include inflation in international markets and weaker foreign currencies, as well as consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands.
We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. And we continue to anticipate our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%.
For added context, I'd like to address what we will anticipate for the fourth quarter. First, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we began stepping up our level of advertising investment in the third quarter. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter. And we anticipate advertising spending to be about 12% of sales to support recent innovation, including our Burt's Bees lip color products and Fresh Step with Febreze Cat Litter. For the full fiscal year, advertising spending is expected to be about 10% of sales, an increase of about 1 point of sales versus year ago. Now while this will reduce margins and earnings in the near term, we believe these are the right strategic investments to drive the long-term growth of our core business.
With respect to the acquisition, we anticipate about a point of sales benefit from Renew Life in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we don't expect the business to contribute meaningfully to company sales until fiscal year 2017, given the acquisition was closed late in fiscal '16. Net of all these factors, we raised our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which includes dilution of about $0.03 to $0.05 from the acquisition. This compares with our previous EPS outlook of $4.75 to $4.90.
I'd also like to provide additional perspective on the Renew Life acquisition, a business rooted in the fast-growing digestive health category and complementary to our global portfolio. This U.S.-centric, bolt-on acquisition is consistent with our strategy to acquire leading brands in fast-growing, midsized health and wellness categories. Over the last several years, Renew Life has enjoyed high single-digit sales increases and gross margins that are generally in line with our company averages. Importantly, we believe the business was acquired for a good price, $290 million or about 2.5x sales. And while this business is anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next year or so, as we invest heavily in demand-creation programs and integrate the business into Clorox, we anticipate the business to be EPS neutral to accretive in fiscal year 2018.
As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, we'll be keenly focused on the following things. 
First, we continue to face a tough business environment in international markets. We anticipate ongoing foreign currency headwinds will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 sales by about 2 points. 
Second, we plan to continue investing heavily in advertising consistent with our full year 2016 spending levels to drive awareness and trial of our new products. Our increased investments will help sustain the momentum of our core business in the face of ongoing competitive activity and consumers who remain cautious in their spending. 
Third, integrating Renew Life into Clorox is a priority, and we’ll place strong emphasis on investing in demand-creation and expanding distribution to drive the growth of the business and its categories. In fiscal year '17, we anticipate Renew Life will contribute nearly 2 percentage points to company sales and expect our investments to integrate and fuel the growth of the business will reduce earnings per share by about $0.05 to $0.07.
In closing, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance and the ability to continue investing strongly in our core business while acquiring a leading brand in Renew Life. We remain committed to our long-term strategy to driving profitable growth, including making strategic investments to fuel our innovation programs and our cost-savings pipeline.
Now I'll turn it over to Benno."
89450,329674512,971626,"The Clorox Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: first, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've b",672,"Thank you, Steve, and hello, to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take 3 things away from today's call and press releases: first, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns; second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brand behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working; third, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds as reflected in the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brand.
I'd like to share a little perspective on each of these 3 areas. The first takeaway. Our Strategy 2020 continues to deliver strong shareholder return. This is certainly evident in our strong Q3 top line growth, reflected by growing market shares in household penetration on key brands in the U.S. On a currency-neutral basis, we're seeing growth in international as well. We have strong gross margin expansion, supporting incremental investments in our brand and we delivered strong earnings per share growth. These results, the health of our businesses, and our overall strong fundamental execution have enabled us to raise our fiscal year sales and earnings outlook. 
The second takeaway. Consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brands behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working. As discussed earlier in the call, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half to support new product, we anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. 
Now you might ask yourself, why the increased investment and why now? Well, we have strong momentum on our brands as evidenced by our recent result and seek to continue that momentum by investing behind our strategic priorities, in particular, the strong innovation currently in market. But we're also continuing to support the health of the base business by investing in awareness and trial. And we do like the long-term returns on these investments based on extensive analytics we do across all of our brand investment. So in a nutshell, we're taking the long-term view to invest in driving sustained profitable growth in an environment where such growth is hard to come by.
And the third takeaway, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds such as digestive health as reflected by the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brand. We are very excited about the opportunity Renew Life brings to the Clorox portfolio as a leader in health and wellness with an emphasis on digestive health. Through this acquisition, we are expanding into a fast-growing market that aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of brands and midsized categories that are #1 or strong #2 in market share, economically attractive and leverage our core competency.
Renew Life is the #1 brand of probiotics in the natural channel, with a steadily growing share in the food, drug and mass channel. And probiotics products represent about 2/3 of Renew Life's sale. Digestive health is a growing consumer need and still a highly fragmented category, which provides for an attractive competitive set. The digestive health market in the U.S. represents annual sales of more than $10 billion and is growing at about 7% annually. The probiotics subcategory is about $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. and is expected to grow at 15% per year. This acquisition enables us to expand our health and wellness platform even further. We believe that we have an opportunity to make a difference to the business through our strong 3D brand-building capability. We also believe that Renew Life has scalability and distribution expansion potential in existing and new channels. So we look forward to building on the strong foundation the Renew Life team has built and bringing the benefits of digestive health products to more consumers, while maintaining a keen focus on the health of our core business. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

You might recall in the third quarter earnings call, we talked about significantly stepping up our consumer demand building investment programs, particularly advertising. You saw that in the third quarter where we invested incrementally about $22 million in advertising, and we're going to step it up again. Part of the timing this year for the advertising investments, it's the reflection of the new product program. If you’re going to step up your level of advertising, you want to have something to talk about, and Fresh Step with Febreze, the Burt's Bees lip color launch, these are the things that we’re really leaning in heavy to. So the spending increase is backloaded this year, but it backloaded consistent with the programs. And then finally, from a return on investment, we do a lot of extensive measuring and tracking and score-carding of all of the investments we make in. Today, we've seen very good returns, we're going to continue to lean in and as always, we'll adjust as appropriate as we get new information by at this point, we feel like it's a very good ROI. But keep in mind, the investments we make in the fourth quarter, most of the benefit will, I think, be in future years as you get awareness and trial on those new products."

Gross margin certainly came in better than we had anticipated in the third quarter. Two drivers I would call out, the first is just stronger top line growth for the company. As you know, you get a bit scale advantage when you have stronger growth, and we also had some positive mix. We had real strength in some of our businesses like Brita, which is higher margin. Our Burt's Bees business, which is higher margin. So that certainly helped. I would also say commodity costs came in a bit better than we had expected. Now I'm going to caution on that as well because I do think commodity cost is starting to reach a bottom at this point. I think we found in the floor. And we're watching it pretty carefully because I think as you go into the fourth quarter and as we look at our gross margin, we think gross margins are likely to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is, we're starting to lap some of the commodity goodness we saw in the year-ago period. And we're also investing more in consumer demand spend that we talked about earlier. So feel great about the margin expansion for the company, feel good about delivering about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year, but I do think, looking forward, gross margin growth is going to start to slow down as the commodity tailwinds dissipate."

I look at Burt's Bees as a very solid role model for this where the first tranche of value accretion came from distribution expansion followed by strong investments in the base business to continue to drive what clearly here is fast-growing category based on a growing consumer need, about 2/3 of U.S. consumers have experienced digestive health issues and that trend is expected to continue behind the dietary habits that we're seeing from consumers. So investing in awareness and trial on the base product, certainly is the second opportunity here. And then the third opportunity is to look at adjacent spaces around whether that's organically or perhaps through additional business development activity and perhaps that will yield an opportunity to add additional growth down the road. But for the time being, we're focused on driving awareness and trial and distribution on the base product by applying our strong 3D capabilities, which I think are a wonderful fit to add to the great work that the current team has already done on the business."

First of all, just continue to drive awareness and trial on the base business, lip, face, body, we have a lot of products out there that enjoy a very strong consumer loyalty, but have an opportunity in increasing awareness and trials, so more consumers can use these products and that is job #1. And we're driving that through tactics like TV advertising which we, for the first time, did last year and which we'll do again this year. And believe we'll deliver solid additional growth, just on the base. The second opportunity, certainly is an expansion into new categories, and we're very pleased with how lipstick is going. It's now the #5 lipstick in a very cluttered market, and it's overtaking -- overtaken some very established and prominent brands. Most recently, lipsticks did receive a very prestigious award by Cosmopolitan magazine who called it their favorite lipstick ever, which certainly is something that we were very pleased to see. And then third, the opportunity continues to be in international, and Steve Austenfeld has talked about that earlier in this call where we believe that both in markets that we're already in, as well as in markets that we have a very small presence, there's a lot of opportunity to repeat the success that we've had in the U.S. and we're investing in that. So category expansion will continue to be name of the game, but it's really part of a three-pronged growth strategy that also includes growth on the base and growth in new countries."

So the success is really based on several things. First of all, just basic consumer trends. We've talked to all of you before about the fact that this is a very preferred product form as consumers increasingly clean in the flow versus on their hands and knees, so we're just having a lot of consumer tailwind. Second, we're fueling those tailwinds with innovation, mostly innovation that increases the versatility of use and allows consumers to use wipes in new places whether that's on glass, whether that's on wood, whether that's in bathroom or more recently for the tougher jobs in the kitchen, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro-Scrubbers has been incredibly successful and is growing market share, and we're fueling that success with additional investment. And then certainly, the distribution expansion like the one that was talked about will help. So we have high hopes that we'll continue to see strong growth on wipes in the future. Certainly, near term, we see -- we'll see very significant growth as we continue to benefit from the Costco distribution expansion.

What I do think is important as a trend to call out is commodity prices which are notoriously difficult to forecast. But again as I said earlier, energy prices have really started come up pretty sharply. It looks like the commodity market has stabilized. What does that mean? It means as we go into fiscal '17, particularly as we move through fiscal '17, I think some of the benefits we've been enjoying from lower commodity costs are going to start to dissipate. What we can do as a company is focus on the things we can control, keeping the cost-savings pipeline healthy, and we're doing that. We are focusing on rebuilding our margins in international with our Go Lean efforts. That's something we're also going to continue. And we're also focused on taking pricing in high inflationary economy. So I think the actions that we're taking should, over the very long term, help us deliver EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 bps, but you will see variability across the quarters and even across the years at times.

Again, what we've said is, we'll price to recover inflation and to our -- protect our margins over the long term, so we would prefer not to take pricing given the consumer remains at a fragile condition. Nonetheless, at this point, we'll take pricing where we need it over the long term. The key for us, ultimately, is going to be innovation and driving innovation growth. So here's how we think of it over the next couple of years and maybe into fiscal '17. We continue to aspire to deliver 3% to 5% top line sales growth. Now embedded in that is an assumption that our U.S. business grows at 2% to 4%. I will say based on what we're seeing not just with the categories, but importantly, our innovation programs and the investment that we're making, we feel very good about delivering solid growth in this range of 2% to 4% based on what we know today. I think the bigger challenge that we have like many other companies is on the international side, where the slowing economies, the FX headwinds, the challenging environment, I think that's likely to weigh on top line sales growth for international in fiscal '17, which is why our efforts to focus on innovation going lean are the right efforts. So on balance, I feel like we are doing a pretty good job as a company. We've got solid plans that we are building now for fiscal '17, and we'll provide additional color on the August call."

So first of all, if I look at just the basic category, fundamentally we're a health and wellness company. So our company was founded 103 years ago today, and it was founded based on disinfecting product and bleach. And over time, whether that's through our Professional Products, through Brita, through Green Works, through Burt's Bees, we have continued to go deeper into health and wellness and this is just another example. So for us, we look at this as a health and wellness business where our capabilities can make a real difference. First of all, this is the #1 brand in the natural channel, but there's a very significant potential to grow through distribution in food, drug, mass, certainly here in the U.S., but also in Canada and then in international over time. And that's really bull's-eye as it relates to applying Clorox world-class capabilities. I would hold up our capabilities when it comes to driving distribution against any company in our space, and we've certainly proven that time and time again. We've also proven that in the health and wellness space through brand-building and through innovation, we can make great differences to businesses that we acquire over time, whether that's Burt's Bees or if you reach further back, Hidden Valley or Brita, we pretty much follow the same model, they were pretty small when we bought them, they were new categories for us when we bought them, but we've made an incredible difference and turned them into brand powerhouses. And as we evaluate it, this space which we're very familiar with through extensive diligence and as we evaluated the fit with our own capabilities, we got to a space where we felt that we're very comfortable that we are not just buying a business that is profitable and in a fast-growing category, but one that we can make significant difference, too."

We've got a very good track record of taking pricing and importantly keeping the pricing that we take and keeping our brands healthy. As much as we would love to be able to price recover all of the FX and inflation, you have to take a measured approach with the consumer so that you do it in a sustainable way. So I would say that as inflation and FX have squeezed margins, particularly in Argentina and some of these larger countries, we are taking pricing, it is sticking but we're trying to do it over time. So it will take time to rebuild the margins through pricing. We're doubling down on our cost savings efforts in some of these countries, applying our U.S. capabilities there, which we think makes good sense. And we're also rightsizing infrastructure investments. Because we do think the international markets, particularly emerging markets, are going to continue to be challenging. And we want to basically assume a challenging environment and structure accordingly. So I think it's going to take time for us to rebuild the international margins.

What I feel most positive about is that the premise that we've always talked about that the 2 companies, Walmart and Clorox, are so strongly strategically aligned, continues to be true. Where they're investing benefits our company, whether that's in the improvement of store operations, which certainly helps us, for instance, by eliminating out of stocks. Whether that's by investing in e-commerce which, as you know, is a growth platform for us as well and remains our fastest-growing channel.

So turning to our commentary on the quarter, there are 3 key messages to take away from today's call. First, as planned, our fourth quarter results reflect significantly increased demand-building investments to support awareness, trial and distribution of our innovation pipeline. Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance as we made further progress against our 2020 Strategy. The choices we're making to drive long-term profitable growth are working, and Stephen and Benno will talk more about that in a moment. And third, we're staying the course with our plans for fiscal year '17, recognizing we continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, a difficult competitive environment and commodity cost volatility as well as the comparison to the strong results we delivered in fiscal year '16. 
So with that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '17, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. 
So turning to Q4. Volume grew 7%, and sales grew 3%. And the variance between volume and sales growth reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, unfavorable product mix and increased levels of trade spending to drive awareness and trial on a number of our new product launches. U.S. growth, broadly speaking, was strong across all segments as well as in our International business when looked at on a currency-neutral basis. 
Excluding the 2-point impact from foreign currency, total company sales in the fourth quarter grew 5%. And if you look at just the U.S., which is more than 80% of our company's revenue, sales also grew 5%. So that was the fourth quarter. 
If you look at the fiscal year, volume grew 4%, with gains in all 4 of our reportable segments. We're certainly very pleased that our growth in shipments was so broad based across all of the U.S. and international segment. 
Again for the year, fiscal '16, sales growth was 2%, reflecting strong volume growth; the benefit of price increases, primarily in International; about 0.5 points of growth from the RenewLife acquisition; as well as strong growth from innovation. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of increased demand spending behind innovation, again primarily in our core business and nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. If you exclude the 3 points of unfavorable FX, full year sales increased 5 points. 
For fiscal year '16, again looking at the full year, we gained 1/10 of a point in market share across tracked channels, with 5 of our 8 U.S. business units holding or growing share, consistent with our strategy to invest more heavily in demand-building activities behind our growth businesses. Recently, we have seen increased competitive activity targeted in a couple of key categories where spending is depressing pricing levels, the most prominent of which is the Bags and Wraps category. 
In addition, we have fully lapped last year's price increase in the Laundry business, and that category, which is about 10% of the company's sales, has returned to its historical run rate of being about flat. 
And in Home Care, Disinfecting Wipes is another category we are monitoring for the impact of competitive activity. So with all these factors in mind, our outlook anticipates U.S. track channel categories will be up about 1% in fiscal year '17. Now it is important to note, however, that we do expect meaningful growth in fiscal year '17 in on track channels, and that's going to be across a number of businesses, particularly Clorox wipes, Kingsford Charcoal and Glad trash bags, and that growth won't be picked up in the traditional market share data. 
So with that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. I'm going to start with our Cleaning segment. In Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 12%, and sales increased 6%, driven primarily by Home Care and our Professional Products business. Looking at the fiscal year, Home Care, which is our largest domestic business unit, it surpassed $1 billion in sales for the first time in fiscal year '16, supported by strong growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, behind recent distribution gains in club channel as well as continued base business strength, driven by increased investments in demand-building. Overall, Home Care delivered a second consecutive year of very strong market share growth. 
Turning to Laundry. Fourth quarter sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. And while market shares across our Laundry business were flat, Clorox Liquid Bleach grew share for the quarter, driven by incremental investments and demand creation, high levels of merchandising support and increased strength or continued strength, I should say, of our premium Clorox Splash-less bleach. 
And finally, our Professional Products business delivered double-digit volume and sales gains in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of professional Cleaning products and our base health care products reflecting distribution gains. For the year, Professional Products delivered high single-digit sales gains on top of high single-digit gains a year ago. 
Turning to our Household segment. Fourth quarter volume increased 7%, and sales grew 5%, reflecting volume and sales growth in each business, along with the benefit of the May 2 acquisition of the RenewLife digestive health business. Our Glad Bags and Wraps business saw high single-digit volume growth following distribution gains and ongoing success from our OdorShield lineup, including Gain-scented trash bags. Our OdorShield innovation continues to support consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, which has resulted in a meaningful market share gain in our premium trash bag segment. And while the overall market share for our Bags and Wraps category was down due to declines in base trash bags, our strategic focus remains on the higher-margin premium bags. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume in the quarter grew as did sales behind our recent launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. We're pleased with the initial response to this launch, which contributed to market share growth in the quarter, and we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive awareness and trial in this highly competitive category. 
Looking at Charcoal. The business grew sales in Q4, and that's following a double-digit sales increase last quarter. Sales or, I should say, results were driven by strong in-season merchandising and strength in the home hardware channel. Notably, in the last 3 years, we have added nearly $100 million in sales on this business, and that's on a base of about $500 million. So we've grown the business by nearly 20%, and again that's just over the last 3 years. 
And lastly, within the Household segment, we feel very good about our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. While still very early, at only 2 months in, initial sales expectations are on track, and integration activities are going well. We feel great about the RenewLife employees who've joined the Clorox team, and we look forward to providing an update on this business in future quarters. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume and sales were up strongly, led by double-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees. Growth in Burt's Bees was driven primarily by innovation in lipsticks, tinted lip balm and BB Cream, supported by growth as well in the base business. 
In our food business, volume and sales also grew solidly, driven by our ranch with bottled salad dressings. These salad dressings leverage the heritage and great taste of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing but with an additional flavor such as cucumber, cilantro lime and others. Since our launch of ranch with dressings, which occurred about 18 months ago, we've gained about 14 share points in the ranch with segment. Additionally, our Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinades continue to perform well with volume gains in Q4. 
Our Brita Water Filtration business delivered flat volume and sales in Q4 as gains in our pour-through and faucet-mount businesses were offset by declines in bottle on-the-go. And while overall share was down, share trends for pour-through and faucet-mount systems are improving. We continue to focus on driving trial distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value, supported by national television ads as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns centering on a partnership to kick off in March between Brita and Stephen Curry, National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. 
And finally, turning to our last reportable segment, which is International. And that segment represents a little less than 20% of our company's sales. Volume was up about 1%, and sales were down 9%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, an impact that Clorox and the peer companies have experienced for over a year now. Excluding the 14% unfavorable impact in foreign currencies in this segment, sales for International grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and nonbleach Laundry additives behind our select demand-creation investments. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '16 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '17."
89450,370128169,1023475,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth a",1562,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While we're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth across all our U.S. segments. Importantly, in fiscal year 2016, we delivered another year of margin expansion, supported by productivity gains and strong cost savings. 
Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 7 points of volume growth, which included more than 1 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and about 1 point of pricing from International. These factors were partially offset by more than 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; about 2 points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by expanded distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a club channel customer; and nearly 1 point of incremental trade spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, a slight decline of 20 basis points, reflecting about 120 basis points from higher manufacturing and logistics costs, 50 basis points of negative impact from onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and about 50 basis points of negative impact from the voluntary recall of certain Liquid-Plumr products. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points from lower commodity costs, reflecting an expected slowdown in recent favorability trends, which we discussed last quarter. 
Selling and administrative expenses came in at 14.1% of sales as expected. And as we previously communicated, we've significantly stepped up our advertising and sales promotion investments for the quarter with an increase of $41 million or 27% versus year ago to about 12% of sales to drive awareness and trial behind innovation and maintain the health of our core business. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26, a decrease of 13% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher sales, more than offset by significantly higher advertising and sales promotion investment, consistent with our strategy to support our brands. 
Onetime integration costs from the RenewLife acquisition also reduced fourth quarter earnings by about $0.03. And as we mentioned in the press release, onetime charges from the voluntary recall of a limited number of Liquid-Plumr products impacted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by nearly $0.04. 
Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew about 2%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth, which included about 0.5 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and nearly 2 points of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of currency headwinds and nearly 1 point of higher trade spending. 
In fiscal year 2016, our product innovation programs delivered about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased significantly, by 150 basis points to 45.1% compared with 43.6% in fiscal year 2015, driven primarily by 140 basis points of favorable commodity costs, 130 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by about 140 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses for the full year came in at about 14% of the sales, essentially flat versus year ago and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% or less of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year 2016 was 10.2%, a full point higher than in fiscal year 2015. 
For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was about 34%. And net of all of these factors, fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared with $4.57 in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%. 
Fiscal year 2016 free cash flow was $596 million or 10.3% of sales compared with $733 million or 13% of sales in the year-ago period. The decrease in cash flow reflects higher tax payments in fiscal year 2016 and higher performance-based incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year '15 results, partially offset by earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. 
In fiscal year 2017, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 10% to 12%, consistent with our long-term goal. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. 
At the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9, just slightly below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
And now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, and here's how we're thinking of sales growth for the fiscal year. 
We anticipate U.S. category growth at about 1%, reflecting slower growth rates than what we saw in fiscal year 2016 driven, in large part, by increased competitive activity at the store shelf in a few categories. Now we expect about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation pipeline. We also anticipate 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. Our sales outlook also includes 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies with more than half of the anticipated impact expected in the first half of the fiscal year, and about 1 point of impact from unfavorable mix. Excluding the 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat following strong margin expansion in fiscal year 2016 as commodity cost tailwinds begin to dissipate. For perspective, on commodities, we've recently seen prices begin to stabilize, and we anticipate a modest benefit from commodity favorability in fiscal year 2017 that will likely decline as we move through the fiscal year. 
We also anticipate unfavorable mix, including new distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club channel customer. Importantly, our cost savings pipeline remains healthy and will help offset inflationary pressures and support higher margins over the long term. We anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points. That's on top of 50 basis points of growth in fiscal year 2016 and reflects lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by a more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs and cost savings. 
Next, as we mentioned in our press release, we're adopting a recently issued accounting standard update that requires tax impacts from stock-based compensation to flow through income taxes on the income statement, a change we believe brings better alignment between earnings and cash flows. Under the previous accounting standard, these difference were recognized in the balance sheet as instead of the income statement. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, benefiting fiscal year diluted earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30. This change also means we'll likely see more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. To be clear, the adoption of this accounting standard will not change the company's total cash flows. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.58. Excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. 
Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to share with you additional thoughts on fiscal year 2017. We believe we have solid plans for fiscal year 2017 but continue to face a tough business environment as well as a comparison to strong fiscal year 2016 results. In light of our expectations of slower growth rates in our U.S. categories, we're closely watching the state of U.S. economy and our consumer. We also expect the ongoing currency headwinds to challenge the profitability of our International business. 
So here's how we're responding. First, we're going to stay the course with our 2020 Strategy. It certainly delivered very good results in fiscal year 26 (sic) [ 2016 ], and in particular, we'll continue to invest strongly behind our U.S. brands and categories, particularly those categories with growth tailwinds and where we have a strong innovation platform. 
Next, we'll continue to execute our Go Lean Strategy in International, which includes taking pricing and continuing to drive cost savings to help rebuild our margins over time. Now we'll also continue investing strategically behind select International growth initiatives such as Burt's Bees, distribution and product innovation. What's important to know is that International is a strategic part of our overall portfolio. We have leading brands across multiple countries, particularly midsized countries, with attractive growth rates and a strong consumer base. While it'll take time, we believe that we're taking the right actions to improve the profitability of our International business over the long term. 
In closing, we're certainly very pleased about our strong finish to fiscal year 2016 on top of the strong results in the year-ago period. We're making the right choices to support the health of our core business and drive the success of our innovation programs, and we continue to support our margins by driving productivity gains and cost savings. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted in his opening remarks, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, our Q4 results reflect incremental strategic investments to drive top line growth that we believe will be sustainable and profitable long term, keeping the core of our business healthy in a continued challenging macroenvironment. This approach is paying off, with increased volumes and sales growth across our U.S. segments. 
Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance and the progress we're making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators, which I believe will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come. 
On the top line, we delivered 2% sales growth or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the 3-point impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On the bottom line, we grew diluted earnings per share a very strong 8%, which includes our deliberately increased demand spending. We grew market share for the U.S. and International, supported by another strong year of innovation. 
We entered the digestive health category. Two months in, the transition is going well, and we're excited to bring the benefits of RenewLife's digestive health products to more consumers by building on the success the team has achieved with our proven distribution, marketing and innovation capabilities, and we delivered top-tier returns for our shareholders, doing it the right way by investing in our brands, providing innovation and better value for our consumers and driving productivity and cost savings in order to not just grow, but grow profitably. 
Third, we're staying the course for fiscal year '17. Our fiscal year 2017 outlook reflects a healthy base business while taking into account ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange, a difficult competitive environment and comparison against our strong fiscal year '16 performance. 
In addition, we're closely monitoring the general health of the U.S. economy and consumer. We have confidence in our strategy, and we'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working well for us. We will continue to accelerate momentum in our portfolio, with strong demand investments behind our brands. We will continue to drive our innovation program and deliver a robust collection of launches in the back half of the new fiscal year. 
We will continue to transform how we engage with consumers in the digital arena, with industry-leading levels of spending that are yielding positive returns. We'll continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund these investments while also growing margins, and we will continue to draw on our extraordinarily engaged workforce that is driven to create solid and consistent value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

As far as the ongoing investment level, in advertising as we'd indicated on the previous call last quarter, we were about 10% of sales this fiscal year, fiscal '16. We anticipate a similar amount in fiscal '17. But to be clear, you will see variability across the quarters. We do like to time these investments when we've got innovation and news to talk about. So you could see it go up and down on the quarter, but I would say the incremental point we put in '16 will remain in '17 based on what we know today."

As we look at the full year for fiscal '17, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Now included in that is about 2 points of foreign currency, which, by the way, offset about 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. So you can kind of net those out. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% on the core basis there, I would say the U.S. business continues to perform very well. We think we'll be well within this 2% to 4% long-term growth target that we have for our U.S. business. International on a currency-neutral basis, we think we'll likely be in this 5% to 7% growth range, but obviously, when you layer in currencies, which are real, International is obviously going to be challenged next year, and it's certainly not going to be growing. So on balance, I would say we're feeling pretty good about the U.S. business. It's challenging in International, which is why we're really leaning in to rebuild the margins and accelerate profitable growth, but we think we have a solid outlook. Again, there will be variability across the quarters as there always is, but we think this is a solid plan."

Growth is hard to come by in the U.S. We have a lot of growth, and we have a lot of growth coming from innovation. But broadly in the industry, there is not a lot of innovation around, which is why as competitors are looking for growth in a reasonably low commodity environment, they're investing in trade, and we're seeing that in various categories: Home Care and Glad, our trash bags are 2 categories that we've mentioned in the past and that are playing out as we anticipated, and we can expect that elevated trade promotion environment to stay with us for the foreseeable future as commodities stay where they are. Our approach perhaps, if you allow me, certainly to an extent respond in kind. So competition doesn't buy share from us that could erode the business in the long run. But our focus mainly is on earning market share, not buying a market share, invest behind innovation, invest behind engaging with the consumer digitally, 2 things that have a long-term positive effect on our brand equity.

Looking forward, how do we feel about margins? We feel good about the EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps, driven by cost savings and lowering our SG&A. I would say cost savings is on track. I feel good about pricing. Most of that will come from International, but let's see what happens with commodity costs if that's different, we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. if we need to over the long term to protect our margins. We will likely get a modest commodity cost tailwind in the fiscal '17 based on what we know today. Again, that will likely dissipate. But when we run the math, Ali, with this number and you can take a look at web attachments I think pretty clear that gets us to numbers that are about flat with some variability across the quarters. I think importantly as we look to fiscal '18 and beyond, I think our belief is that we're laying the groundwork for continued healthy margin expansion, 25 to 50 bps of EBIT, and I think over the long term, gross margins will also continue to grow, but I think fiscal '17 for the reasons we've articulated coming off of 2 record gross margin years, probably closer to flattish."

And in fact, the market leader in the natural channel to food, drug mass, where the brand is arguably somewhat underrepresented and where the growth in the categories really taking off right now and of course, that is an excellent fit with our capabilities because building categories and profitable brands with our customers in the Food, drug, mass channel is the hallmark of what the Clorox Company has been known for, and we think that, that capability is playing very well for RenewLife, and that will be our first growth pillar for the business this fiscal year."

So we continue to be interested in that, and then we've always said that health and wellness is an area of opportunity for us, and that can have many legs. Certainly, the probiotics category and dietary supplements is one that we've made a foray in now. There are also other aspects of health and wellness that we're interested in, but to your specific question on OTC, that is less of a focus for us as a company. We like businesses that are on strategy and importantly, a great fit with our capabilities.

We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.
Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our commentary on the quarter. There are 3 key messages to take away from today's call: First, as planned, our fourth quarter results reflect significantly increased demand-building investments to support awareness, trial and distribution of our innovation pipeline; second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance as we made further progress against our 2020 Strategy. The choices we're making to drive long-term profitable growth are working, and Steve and Benno will talk more about that in a moment; and third, we're staying the course with our plans for fiscal year '17, recognizing we continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, a difficult competitive environment and commodity cost volatility as well as the comparison to the strong results we delivered in fiscal year '16. 
So with that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And then finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. 
So turning to Q4. Volume grew 7%, and sales grew 3%. And the variance between volume and sales growth reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, unfavorable product mix and increased levels of trade spending to drive awareness and trial on a number of our new product launches. U.S. growth, broadly speaking, was strong across all segments as well as in our international business when looked at on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 2-point impact from foreign currency, total company sales in the fourth quarter grew 5%. And if you look at just the U.S., which is more than 80% of our company's revenue, sales also grew 5%. So that was the fourth quarter. 
If you look at the fiscal year, volume grew 4%, with gains in all 4 of our reportable segments. We're certainly very pleased that our growth in shipments was so broad-based across all of the U.S. and international segments. Again for the year, fiscal '16, sales growth was 2%, reflecting strong volume growth; the benefit of price increases, primarily in international; about 0.5 points of growth from the RenewLife acquisition; as well as strong growth from innovation. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of increased demand spending behind innovation, again, primarily in our core business and nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. If you exclude the 3 points of unfavorable FX, full year sales increased 5 points. 
For fiscal year '16, again looking at the full year, we gained 0.01 point in market share across tracked channels, with 5 of our 8 U.S. business units holding or growing share, consistent with our strategy to invest more heavily in demand-building activities behind our growth businesses. Recently, we have seen increased competitive activity targeted in a couple of key categories, where spending is depressing pricing levels, the most prominent of which is the Bags and Wraps category. 
In addition, we have fully lapped last year's price increase in the Laundry business. And that category, which is about 10% of the company sales, has returned to its historical run rate of being about flat. 
And in Home Care, Disinfecting Wipes is another category we are monitoring for the impact of competitive activity. 
So with all these factors in mind, our outlook anticipates U.S. tracked channel categories to be up about 1% in fiscal year '17. Now it is important to note, however, that we do expect meaningful growth in fiscal year '17 in on-track channels, and that's going to be across a number of businesses, particularly Clorox wipes, Kingsford charcoal and Glad trash bags, and that growth won't be picked up in the traditional market share data. 
So with that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. I'm going to start with our Cleaning segment. In Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 12%, and sales increased 6%, driven primarily by Home Care and our Professional Products business. Looking at the fiscal year, Home Care, which is our largest domestic business unit, it surpassed $1 billion in sales for the first time in fiscal year '16, supported by strong growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, behind recent distribution gains in the club channel as well as continued base business strength, driven by increased investments in demand-building. Overall, Home Care delivered a second consecutive year of very strong market share growth. 
Turning to Laundry. Fourth quarter sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. And while market shares across our Laundry business were flat, Clorox Liquid Bleach grew share for the quarter, driven by incremental investments in demand creation, high levels of merchandising support and increased strength -- or continued strength, I should say, of our premium Clorox Splash-less bleach. 
And finally, our Professional Products business delivered double-digit volume and sales gains in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of professional cleaning products and our base health care products reflecting distribution gains. For the year, Professional Products delivered high single-digit sales gains on top of high single-digit gains a year ago. 
Turning to our Household segment. Fourth quarter volume increased 7%, and sales grew 5%, reflecting volume and sales growth in each business, along with the benefit of the May 2 acquisition of the RenewLife digestive health business. Our Glad Bags and Wraps business saw high single-digit volume growth following distribution gains and ongoing success from our OdorShield lineup, including Gain-scented trash bags. Our OdorShield innovation continues to support consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, which has resulted in a meaningful market share gain in our premium trash bag segment. And while the overall market share for our Bags and Wraps category was down due to declines in base trash bags, our strategic focus remains on the higher-margin premium bags. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume in the quarter grew as did sales behind our recent launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. We're pleased with the initial response to this launch, which contributed to market share growth in the quarter, and we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive awareness and trial in this highly competitive category. 
Looking at Charcoal. The business grew sales in Q4, and that's following a double-digit sales increase last quarter. Sales -- or I should say, results were driven by strong in-season merchandising and strength in the home hardware channel. Notably, in the last 3 years, we have added nearly $100 million in sales on this business, and that's on a base of about $500 million. So we've grown the business by nearly 20%. And again, that's just over the last 3 years. 
And lastly, within the Household segment, we feel very good about our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. While still very early, at only 2 months in, initial sales expectations are on track, and integration activities are going well. We feel great about the RenewLife employees who've joined the Clorox team, and we look forward to providing an update on this business in future quarters. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume and sales were up strongly, led by double-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees. Growth in Burt's Bees was driven primarily by innovation in lipsticks, tinted lip balm and BB cream, supported by growth as well in the base business. 
In our Food business, volume and sales also grew solidly, driven by our ranch with bottled salad dressings. These salad dressings leverage the heritage and great taste of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing but with an additional flavor, such as sriracha, cucumber, cilantro lime and others. Since our launch of ranch with dressings, which occurred about 18 months ago, we've gained about 14 share points in the ranch with segment. Additionally, our Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinades continue to perform well with volume gains in Q4. 
Our Brita Water Filtration business delivered flat volume and sales in Q4, as gains in our pour-through and faucet-mount businesses were offset by declines in bottle on-the-go. And while overall share was down, share trends for pour-through and faucet-mount systems are improving. We are continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value supported by national television ads as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns centering on a partnership that kicked off in March between Brita and Stephen Curry, National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. 
And finally, turning to our last reportable segment, which is International. That segment represents a little less than 20% of our company sales. Volume was up about 1%, and sales were down 9%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, an impact that Clorox and our peer companies have experienced for over a year now. Excluding the 14% unfavorable impact in foreign currencies in this segment, sales for International grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and nonbleach laundry additives behind our select demand-creation investments. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '16 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '17."
89450,370128169,1023788,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year.

We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth across all our U.S. segments. Importantly, in fiscal year 2016, we delivered another year of margin expansion supported by productivity gains and strong cost savings. 
Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 7 points of volume growth, which included more than 1 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and about 1 point of pricing from International. These factors were partially offset by more than 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; about 2 points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by expanded distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a club channel customer; and nearly 1 point of incremental trade spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, a slight decline of 20 basis points, reflecting about 120 basis points from higher manufacturing and logistics costs, 50 basis points of negative impact from onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and about 50 basis points of negative impact from the voluntary recall of certain Liquid-Plumr products. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points from lower commodity costs, reflecting an expected slowdown in recent favorability trends, which we discussed last quarter. 
Selling and administrative expenses came in at 14.1% of sales, as expected. And as we previously communicated, we've significantly stepped up our advertising and sales promotion investments for the quarter, with an increase of $41 million or 27% versus year ago to about 12% of sales, to drive awareness and trial behind innovation and maintain the health of our core business. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26, a decrease of 13% versus the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher sales, more than offset by significantly higher advertising and sales promotion investment consistent with our strategy to support our brands. 
Onetime integration costs from the RenewLife acquisition also reduced fourth quarter earnings by about $0.03. And as we mentioned in the press release, onetime charges from the voluntary recall of a limited number of Liquid-Plumr products impacted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by nearly $0.04. 
Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew about 2%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth, which included about 0.5 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and nearly 2 points of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of currency headwinds and nearly 1 point of higher trade spending. In fiscal year 2016, our product innovation programs delivered about 3 points of incremental sales growth. 
Gross margin for the fiscal year increased significantly by 150 basis points to 45.1% compared with 43.6% in fiscal year 2015, driven primarily by 140 basis points of favorable commodity costs, 130 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by about 140 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses for the full year came in at about 14% of the sales, essentially flat versus year ago and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of -- or less of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year 2016 was 10.2%, a full point higher than in fiscal year 2015. 
For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was about 34%. And net of all of these factors, fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared with $4.57 in the year ago period, an increase of 8%. 
Fiscal year 2016 free cash flow was $596 million or 10.3% of sales compared with $733 million or 13% of sales in the year ago period. The decrease in cash flow reflects higher tax payments in fiscal year 2016 and higher performance-based incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year '15 results, partially offset by earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. 
In fiscal year '17, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 10% to 12%, consistent with our long-term goal. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. 
At the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9, just slightly below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
And now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, and here's how we're thinking of sales growth for the fiscal year. We anticipate U.S. category growth at about 1%, reflecting slower growth rates than what we saw in fiscal year 2016, driven, in large part, by increased competitive activity at the store shelf in a few categories. And we expect about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation pipeline. We also anticipate 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. Our sales outlook also includes 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, with more than half of the anticipated impact expected in the first half of the fiscal year and about 1 point of impact from unfavorable mix. Excluding the 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat, following strong margin expansion in fiscal year 2016 as commodity cost tailwinds begin to dissipate. For perspective on commodities, we've recently seen prices begin to stabilize, and we anticipate a modest benefit from commodity favorability in fiscal year 2017 that will likely decline as we move through the fiscal year. 
We also anticipate unfavorable mix, including new distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club channel customer. Importantly, our cost savings pipeline remains healthy and will help offset inflationary pressures and support higher margins over the long term. We anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points. That's on top of 50 basis points of growth in fiscal year 2016 and reflects lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs and cost savings. 
Next, as we mentioned in our press release, we're adopting a recently issued accounting standard update that requires tax impacts from stock-based compensation to flow through income taxes on the income statement, a change, we believe, brings better alignment between earnings and cash flows. Under the previous accounting standard, these differences were recognized in the balance sheet as -- instead of the income statement. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, benefiting fiscal year diluted earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30. This change also means we'll likely see more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. To be clear, the adoption of this accounting standard will not change the company's total cash flows. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.58. Excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. 
Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to share with you additional thoughts on fiscal year 2017. We believe we have solid plans for fiscal year 2017 but continue to face a tough business environment as well as a comparison to strong fiscal year 2016 results. In light of our expectations of slower growth rates in our U.S. categories, we're closely watching the state of U.S. economy and our consumer. We also expect ongoing foreign currency headwinds to challenge the profitability of our international business. 
So here's how we're responding. First, we're going to stay the course with our 2020 Strategy. It certainly delivered very good results in fiscal year 26 (sic) [ 2016 ]. And in particular, we'll continue to invest strongly behind our U.S. brands and categories, particularly those categories with growth tailwinds and where we have a strong innovation platform. 
Next, we'll continue to execute our Go Lean Strategy in International, which includes taking pricing and continuing to drive cost savings to help rebuild our margins over time. We'll also continue investing strategically behind select international growth initiatives such as Burt's Bees distribution and product innovation. What's important to know is that International is a strategic part of our overall portfolio. We have leading brands across multiple countries, particularly midsized countries, with attractive growth rates and a strong consumer base. While it'll take time, we believe that we're taking the right actions to improve the profitability of our international business over the long term. 
In closing, we're certainly very pleased about our strong finish to fiscal year 2016 on top of the strong results in the year ago period. We're making the right choices to support the health of our core business and drive the success of our innovation programs, and we continue to support our margins by driving productivity gains and cost savings. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted in his opening remarks, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, our Q4 results reflect incremental strategic investments to drive top line growth that, we believe, will be sustainable and profitable long term, keeping the core of our business healthy in a continued challenging macroeconomic environment. This approach is paying off, with increased volume and sales growth across our U.S. segments. 
Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance and the progress we're making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators, which, I believe, will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come. 
On the top line, we delivered 2% sales growth or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the 3-point impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On the bottom line, we grew diluted earnings per share a very strong 8%, which includes our deliberately increased demand spending. We grew market share for the U.S. and International, supported by another strong year of innovation. 
We entered the digestive health category. Two months in, the transition is going well, and we're excited to bring the benefits of RenewLife's digestive health products to more consumers by building on the success the team has achieved with our proven distribution, marketing and innovation capabilities. And we delivered top-tier returns for our shareholders, doing it the right way, by investing in our brands, providing innovation and better value for our consumers and driving productivity and cost savings in order not -- to not just grow, but grow profitably. 
Third, we're staying the course for fiscal year '17. Our fiscal year 2017 outlook reflects a healthy base business while taking into account ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange, a difficult competitive environment and comparison against our strong fiscal year '16 performance. 
In addition, we're closely monitoring the general health of the U.S. economy and consumer. We have confidence in our strategy and will continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working well for us. We will continue to accelerate momentum in our portfolio with strong demand investments behind our brands. We will continue to drive our innovation program and deliver a robust collection of launches in the back half of the new fiscal year. We will continue to transform how we engage with consumers in the digital arena with industry-leading levels of spending that are yielding positive returns. We'll continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund these investments while also growing margins, and we will continue to draw on our extraordinarily engaged workforce that is driven to create solid and consistent value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

So we certainly would expect to get some benefit in the first half from the investments we made in the fourth quarter. As far as the ongoing investment level, in advertising, as we'd indicated on the previous call last quarter, we were about 10% of sales this fiscal year, fiscal '16. We anticipate a similar amount in fiscal '17. But to be clear, you will see variability across the quarters. We do like to time these investments when we've got innovation and news to talk about. So you could see it go up and down on the quarter, but I would say the incremental point we put in '16 will remain in '17 based on what we know today."

We received a little over $10 million for it, so we certainly felt very good about that. And that did give us a onetime gain in the quarter.

Let me try to build on the comments that I made at the opening, where we tried to break out for you our expectations around category growth, obviously, the benefit of RenewLife and innovation. Here's another way to think of it. As we look at the full year for fiscal '17, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Now included in that is about 2 points of foreign currency, which, by the way, offset about 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. So you can kind of net those out. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% on the core basis there, I would say the U.S. business continues to perform very well. We think we'll be well within this 2% to 4% long-term growth target that we have for our U.S. business. International, on a currency-neutral basis, we think will likely be in this 5% to 7% growth range. But obviously, when you layer in currencies, which are real, International is obviously going to be challenged next year, and it's certainly not going to be growing. So on balance, I would say we're feeling pretty good about the U.S. business. It's challenging in International, which is why we're really leaning in to rebuild the margins and accelerate profitable growth. But we think we have a solid outlook. Again, there'll be variability across the quarters as there always is, but we think this is a solid plan."

You've mentioned wipes, which is pretty obvious and doing really well in the club channel. We're also seeing very strong merchandising in Kingsford charcoal, which has been on a remarkable run over the last year, in particular as it relates to home hardware, which also is not tracked. And then we're starting to see what we talk -- started talking about perhaps 18 months ago our LOOP SKUs, low out-of-pocket SKUs, that are at the very low end of the dollar channel and also not tracked. To make an impact, we have 22 of such SKUs out there right now, and they're well received as consumers are looking for value at all ends of the spectrum. And that's starting to do pretty well. So I would point to those factors in particular, but perhaps to general strength across our portfolio outside tracked channels as consumers are looking for value and a lot of value is to be found in those nontracked channels."

We did pick up the incremental distribution at a major club account, which is great. It's a nice business. It's profitable, but it has lower gross margins.

And again, this is something that we anticipated about a year ago and is playing out about as foreshadowed. Growth is hard to come by in the U.S. We have a lot of growth, and we have a lot of growth coming from innovation. But broadly in the industry, there is not a lot of innovation around, which is why as competitors are looking for growth in a reasonably low commodity environment, they're investing in trade. And we're seeing that in various categories: Home Care and Glad. Our trash bags are 2 categories that we've mentioned in the past and that are playing out as we anticipated. And we can expect that elevated trade promotion environment to stay with us for the foreseeable future as commodities stay where they are. Our approach, perhaps, if you allow me, is certainly to an extent respond in kind so competition doesn't buy share from us that could erode the business in the long run. But our focus mainly is on earning market share, not buying market share, invest behind innovation, invest behind engaging with the consumer digitally, 2 things that have a long-term positive effect on our brand equity. So that can mean that we may be willing to temporarily accept share declines, for instance, on Glad, where we're seeing that right now, but always with an eye on the long-term health of our business and the profitability. So in a nutshell, elevated trade spend from branded competitors is likely to here to stay, and we're applying a balanced and disciplined approach, as you'd expect."

You got a couple of questions in there, but I just want to make sure for clarity's sake. Commodity costs were a tailwind in the fourth quarter, but they were less of a tailwind than what we had previously seen. It was about a 90 basis point tailwind. It had been about 180 in the previous 2 quarters. So to be clear, that certainly was nice. Looking forward, how do we feel about margins? We feel good about the EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps, driven by cost savings and lowering our SG&A. I would say, cost savings is on track. I feel good about pricing. Most of that will come from International, but let's see what happens with commodity costs. If that's different, we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. if we need to over the long term to protect our margins. We will likely get a modest commodity cost tailwind in fiscal '17 based on what we know today. Again, that will likely dissipate. But when we run the math, Ali, with these numbers, and you can take a look at web attachments, and I think it'll be pretty clear, that gets us to numbers that are about flat with some variability across the quarters. I think importantly as we look to fiscal '18 and beyond, I think our belief is that we're laying the groundwork for continued healthy margin expansion, 25 to 50 bps of EBIT. And I think over the long term, gross margins will also continue to grow. But I think fiscal '17, for the reasons we've articulated, coming off of 2 record gross margin years, probably closer to flattish."

Certainly, what we've seen historically is that whenever there's a more significant uptick in commodities costs, that some of that trade promotion activity, and the Glad business, perhaps, is a prime example of that, generally tends to subside.

And we think that the capabilities that we brought to the business are going to help us with e-commerce. But I will tell you, the biggest opportunity -- immediate opportunity, perhaps, for us is to take a brand that is heavily skewed towards the natural channel and in fact, the market leader in the natural channel to food, drug, mass, where the brand is arguably somewhat underrepresented and where the growth in the category is really taking off right now. And of course, that is an excellent fit with our capabilities because building categories and profitable brands with our customers in the food, drug, mass channel is the hallmark of what the Clorox Company has been known for. And we think that, that capability is playing very well for RenewLife, and that will be our first growth pillar for the business this fiscal year."

We've said that we like food enhancers as a category that we have capabilities in, and that is a growing trend in consumers and a very profitable category that has tailwinds. So we continue to be interested in that. And then we've always said that health and wellness is an area of opportunity for us, and that can have many legs. Certainly, the probiotics category and dietary supplements is one that we've made a foray in now. There are also other aspects of health and wellness that we're interested in. But to your specific question on OTC, that is less of a focus for us as a company. We like businesses that are on strategy and importantly, a great fit with our capabilities. And as you got from our previous remarks, distribution capability in food, drug, mass is one of our world-class capabilities, and we'd like to take advantage of that rather than build new distribution capabilities that are less center of plate for the company."

I think a couple of things need to be true: number one, we got to keep driving cost savings hard. We have to keep really challenging productivity, which we're doing. And that's why, as we've talked for some time, we've got a glide path in place over the next 3 years with every function in this company to make sure we're being as productive as possible. And I think if we do that, I think if we rebuild the margins in our International business, I do think you're going to see that number continue to float down. The other thing I would just point out, and this is really consistent with my opening comments on fiscal '17, we're coming off of 2 really good years in fiscal '15 and fiscal '16. Our compensation programs reflect that. I think we're making an assumption in fiscal '17 that the conversation will return to more normalized levels, although let's see what happens with the results of the business.

Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our commentary on the quarter. There are 3 key messages to take away from today's call: First, as planned, our fourth quarter results reflect significantly increased demand-building investments to support awareness, trial and distribution of our innovation pipeline; second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance as we made further progress against our 2020 Strategy. The choices we're making to drive long-term profitable growth are working, and Steve and Benno will talk more about that in a moment; and third, we're staying the course with our plans for fiscal year '17, recognizing we continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, a difficult competitive environment and commodity cost volatility as well as the comparison to the strong results we delivered in fiscal year '16. 
So with that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And then finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. 
So turning to Q4. Volume grew 7%, and sales grew 3%. And the variance between volume and sales growth reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, unfavorable product mix and increased levels of trade spending to drive awareness and trial on a number of our new product launches. U.S. growth, broadly speaking, was strong across all segments as well as in our international business when looked at on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 2-point impact from foreign currency, total company sales in the fourth quarter grew 5%. And if you look at just the U.S., which is more than 80% of our company's revenue, sales also grew 5%. So that was the fourth quarter. 
If you look at the fiscal year, volume grew 4%, with gains in all 4 of our reportable segments. We're certainly very pleased that our growth in shipments was so broad-based across all of the U.S. and international segments. Again for the year, fiscal '16, sales growth was 2%, reflecting strong volume growth; the benefit of price increases, primarily in international; about 0.5 points of growth from the RenewLife acquisition; as well as strong growth from innovation. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of increased demand spending behind innovation, again, primarily in our core business and nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. If you exclude the 3 points of unfavorable FX, full year sales increased 5 points. 
For fiscal year '16, again looking at the full year, we gained 0.01 point in market share across tracked channels, with 5 of our 8 U.S. business units holding or growing share, consistent with our strategy to invest more heavily in demand-building activities behind our growth businesses. Recently, we have seen increased competitive activity targeted in a couple of key categories, where spending is depressing pricing levels, the most prominent of which is the Bags and Wraps category. 
In addition, we have fully lapped last year's price increase in the Laundry business. And that category, which is about 10% of the company sales, has returned to its historical run rate of being about flat. 
And in Home Care, Disinfecting Wipes is another category we are monitoring for the impact of competitive activity. 
So with all these factors in mind, our outlook anticipates U.S. tracked channel categories to be up about 1% in fiscal year '17. Now it is important to note, however, that we do expect meaningful growth in fiscal year '17 in on-track channels, and that's going to be across a number of businesses, particularly Clorox wipes, Kingsford charcoal and Glad trash bags, and that growth won't be picked up in the traditional market share data. 
So with that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. I'm going to start with our Cleaning segment. In Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 12%, and sales increased 6%, driven primarily by Home Care and our Professional Products business. Looking at the fiscal year, Home Care, which is our largest domestic business unit, it surpassed $1 billion in sales for the first time in fiscal year '16, supported by strong growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, behind recent distribution gains in the club channel as well as continued base business strength, driven by increased investments in demand-building. Overall, Home Care delivered a second consecutive year of very strong market share growth. 
Turning to Laundry. Fourth quarter sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. And while market shares across our Laundry business were flat, Clorox Liquid Bleach grew share for the quarter, driven by incremental investments in demand creation, high levels of merchandising support and increased strength -- or continued strength, I should say, of our premium Clorox Splash-less bleach. 
And finally, our Professional Products business delivered double-digit volume and sales gains in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of professional cleaning products and our base health care products reflecting distribution gains. For the year, Professional Products delivered high single-digit sales gains on top of high single-digit gains a year ago. 
Turning to our Household segment. Fourth quarter volume increased 7%, and sales grew 5%, reflecting volume and sales growth in each business, along with the benefit of the May 2 acquisition of the RenewLife digestive health business. Our Glad Bags and Wraps business saw high single-digit volume growth following distribution gains and ongoing success from our OdorShield lineup, including Gain-scented trash bags. Our OdorShield innovation continues to support consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, which has resulted in a meaningful market share gain in our premium trash bag segment. And while the overall market share for our Bags and Wraps category was down due to declines in base trash bags, our strategic focus remains on the higher-margin premium bags. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume in the quarter grew as did sales behind our recent launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. We're pleased with the initial response to this launch, which contributed to market share growth in the quarter, and we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive awareness and trial in this highly competitive category. 
Looking at Charcoal. The business grew sales in Q4, and that's following a double-digit sales increase last quarter. Sales -- or I should say, results were driven by strong in-season merchandising and strength in the home hardware channel. Notably, in the last 3 years, we have added nearly $100 million in sales on this business, and that's on a base of about $500 million. So we've grown the business by nearly 20%. And again, that's just over the last 3 years. 
And lastly, within the Household segment, we feel very good about our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. While still very early, at only 2 months in, initial sales expectations are on track, and integration activities are going well. We feel great about the RenewLife employees who've joined the Clorox team, and we look forward to providing an update on this business in future quarters. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume and sales were up strongly, led by double-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees. Growth in Burt's Bees was driven primarily by innovation in lipsticks, tinted lip balm and BB cream, supported by growth as well in the base business. 
In our Food business, volume and sales also grew solidly, driven by our ranch-with bottled salad dressings. These salad dressings leverage the heritage and great taste of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing but with an additional flavor, such as sriracha, cucumber, cilantro lime and others. Since our launch of ranch-with dressings, which occurred about 18 months ago, we've gained about 14 share points in the ranch-with segment. Additionally, our Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinades continue to perform well with volume gains in Q4. 
Our Brita Water Filtration business delivered flat volume and sales in Q4, as gains in our pour-through and faucet-mount businesses were offset by declines in bottle on-the-go. And while overall share was down, share trends for pour-through and faucet-mount systems are improving. We are continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value supported by national television ads as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns centering on a partnership that kicked off in March between Brita and Stephen Curry, National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. 
And finally, turning to our last reportable segment, which is International. That segment represents a little less than 20% of our company sales. Volume was up about 1%, and sales were down 9%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, an impact that Clorox and our peer companies have experienced for over a year now. Excluding the 14% unfavorable impact in foreign currencies in this segment, sales for International grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and nonbleach laundry additives behind our select demand creation investments. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '16 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '17."
89450,370128169,1024121,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year.

We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth across all our U.S. segments. Importantly, in fiscal year 2016, we delivered another year of margin expansion supported by productivity gains and strong cost savings. 
Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 7 points of volume growth, which included more than 1 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and about 1 point of pricing from International. These factors were partially offset by more than 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; about 2 points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by expanded distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a club channel customer; and nearly 1 point of incremental trade spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, a slight decline of 20 basis points, reflecting about 120 basis points from higher manufacturing and logistics costs, 50 basis points of negative impact from onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and about 50 basis points of negative impact from the voluntary recall of certain Liquid-Plumr products. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points from lower commodity costs, reflecting an expected slowdown in recent favorability trends, which we discussed last quarter. 
Selling and administrative expenses came in at 14.1% of sales, as expected. And as we previously communicated, we've significantly stepped up our advertising and sales promotion investments for the quarter, with an increase of $41 million or 27% versus year ago to about 12% of sales, to drive awareness and trial behind innovation and maintain the health of our core business. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26, a decrease of 13% versus the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher sales, more than offset by significantly higher advertising and sales promotion investments consistent with our strategy to support our brands. 
Onetime integration costs from the RenewLife acquisition also reduced fourth quarter earnings by about $0.03. And as we mentioned in the press release, onetime charges from the voluntary recall of a limited number of Liquid-Plumr products impacted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by nearly $0.04. 
Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew about 2%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth, which included about 0.5 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and nearly 2 points of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of currency headwinds and nearly 1 point of higher trade spending. In fiscal year 2016, our product innovation programs delivered about 3 points of incremental sales growth. 
Gross margin for the fiscal year increased significantly by 150 basis points to 45.1% compared with 43.6% in fiscal year 2015, driven primarily by 140 basis points of favorable commodity costs, 130 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by about 140 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses for the full year came in at about 14% of the sales, essentially flat versus year ago and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of -- or less of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year 2016 was 10.2%, a full point higher than in fiscal year 2015. 
For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was about 34%. And net of all of these factors, fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared with $4.57 in the year ago period, an increase of 8%. 
Fiscal year 2016 free cash flow was $596 million or 10.3% of sales compared with $733 million or 13% of sales in the year ago period. The decrease in cash flow reflects higher tax payments in fiscal year 2016 and higher performance-based incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year '15 results, partially offset by earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. 
In fiscal year '17, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 10% to 12%, consistent with our long-term goal. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. 
At the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9, just slightly below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
And now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, and here's how we're thinking of sales growth for the fiscal year. We anticipate U.S. category growth at about 1%, reflecting slower growth rates than what we saw in fiscal year 2016, driven, in large part, by increased competitive activity at the store shelf in a few categories. And we expect about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation pipeline. We also anticipate 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. Our sales outlook also includes 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, with more than half of the anticipated impact expected in the first half of the fiscal year and about 1 point of impact from unfavorable mix. Excluding the 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat, following strong margin expansion in fiscal year 2016 as commodity cost tailwinds begin to dissipate. For perspective on commodities, we've recently seen prices begin to stabilize, and we anticipate a modest benefit from commodity favorability in fiscal year 2017 that will likely decline as we move through the fiscal year. 
We also anticipate unfavorable mix, including new distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club channel customer. Importantly, our cost savings pipeline remains healthy and will help offset inflationary pressures and support higher margins over the long term. We anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points. That's on top of 50 basis points of growth in fiscal year 2016 and reflects lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation cost and cost savings. 
Next, as we mentioned in our press release, we're adopting a recently issued accounting standard update that requires tax impacts from stock-based compensation to flow through income taxes on the income statement, a change, we believe, brings better alignment between earnings and cash flows. Under the previous accounting standard, these differences were recognized in the balance sheet as -- instead of the income statement. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, benefiting fiscal year diluted earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30. This change also means we'll likely see more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. To be clear, the adoption of this accounting standard will not change the company's total cash flows. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.58. Excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. 
Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to share with you additional thoughts on fiscal year 2017. We believe we have solid plans for fiscal year 2017 but continue to face a tough business environment as well as a comparison to strong fiscal year 2016 results. In light of our expectations of slower growth rates in our U.S. categories, we're closely watching the state of U.S. economy and our consumer. We also expect ongoing foreign currency headwinds to challenge the profitability of our international business. 
So here's how we're responding. First, we're going to stay the course with our 2020 Strategy. It certainly delivered very good results in fiscal year 26 (sic) [ 2016 ]. And in particular, we'll continue to invest strongly behind our U.S. brands and categories, particularly those categories with growth tailwinds and where we have a strong innovation platform. 
Next, we'll continue to execute our Go Lean Strategy in International, which includes taking pricing and continuing to drive cost savings to help rebuild our margins over time. We'll also continue investing strategically behind select international growth initiatives such as Burt's Bees distribution and product innovation. What's important to know is that International is a strategic part of our overall portfolio. We have leading brands across multiple countries, particularly midsized countries, with attractive growth rates and a strong consumer base. While it'll take time, we believe that we're taking the right actions to improve the profitability of our international business over the long term. 
In closing, we're certainly very pleased about our strong finish to fiscal year 2016 on top of the strong results in the year ago period. We're making the right choices to support the health of our core business and drive the success of our innovation programs, and we continue to support our margins by driving productivity gains and cost savings. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted in his opening remarks, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, our Q4 results reflect incremental strategic investments to drive top line growth that, we believe, will be sustainable and profitable long term, keeping the core of our business healthy in a continued challenging macroeconomic environment. This approach is paying off, with increased volume and sales growth across our U.S. segments. 
Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance and the progress we're making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators, which, I believe, will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come. 
On the top line, we delivered 2% sales growth or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the 3-point impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On the bottom line, we grew diluted earnings per share a very strong 8%, which includes our deliberately increased demand spending. We grew market share for the U.S. and International, supported by another strong year of innovation. 
We entered the digestive health category. Two months in, the transition is going well, and we're excited to bring the benefits of RenewLife's digestive health products to more consumers by building on the success the team has achieved with our proven distribution, marketing and innovation capabilities. And we delivered top-tier returns for our shareholders, doing it the right way, by investing in our brands, providing innovation and better value for our consumers and driving productivity and cost savings in order not -- to not just grow, but grow profitably. 
Third, we're staying the course for fiscal year '17. Our fiscal year 2017 outlook reflects a healthy base business while taking into account ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange, a difficult competitive environment and comparison against our strong fiscal year '16 performance. 
In addition, we're closely monitoring the general health of the U.S. economy and consumer. We have confidence in our strategy and will continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working well for us. We will continue to accelerate momentum in our portfolio with strong demand investments behind our brands. We will continue to drive our innovation program and deliver a robust collection of launches in the back half of the new fiscal year. We will continue to transform how we engage with consumers in the digital arena with industry-leading levels of spending that are yielding positive returns. We'll continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund these investments while also growing margins, and we will continue to draw on our extraordinarily engaged workforce that is driven to create solid and consistent value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

Actually, what I'd recommend that you do and recommend that everybody do in this is if you look at the most recent 10-K that we have out there, if you go to the footnotes in the tax section, you'll actually see historically what this benefit has been that's been flowing through equity.

So we certainly would expect to get some benefit in the first half from the investments we made in the fourth quarter. As far as the ongoing investment level, in advertising, as we'd indicated on the previous call last quarter, we were about 10% of sales this fiscal year, fiscal '16. We anticipate a similar amount in fiscal '17. But to be clear, you will see variability across the quarters. We do like to time these investments when we've got innovation and news to talk about. So you could see it go up and down on the quarter, but I would say the incremental point we put in '16 will remain in '17 based on what we know today."

So we made the decision to close the Los Angeles bleach facility, move the volume to other network -- plants within our network. And as a result, we were able to sell the facility. We received a little over $10 million for it, so we certainly felt very good about that. And that did give us a onetime gain in the quarter. Now just as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we also had a similar onetime gain, but this was on the sale of low-income housing partnerships that we had.

Let me try to build on the comments that I made at the opening, where we tried to break out for you our expectations around category growth, obviously, the benefit of RenewLife and innovation. Here's another way to think of it. As we look at the full year for fiscal '17, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Now included in that is about 2 points of foreign currency, which, by the way, offset about 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. So you can kind of net those out. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% on the core basis there, I would say the U.S. business continues to perform very well. We think we'll be well within this 2% to 4% long-term growth target that we have for our U.S. business. International, on a currency-neutral basis, we think will likely be in this 5% to 7% growth range. But obviously, when you layer in currencies, which are real, International is obviously going to be challenged next year, and it's certainly not going to be growing. So on balance, I would say we're feeling pretty good about the U.S. business. It's challenging in International, which is why we're really leaning in to rebuild the margins and accelerate profitable growth. But we think we have a solid outlook. Again, there'll be variability across the quarters as there always is, but we think this is a solid plan."

You've mentioned wipes, which is pretty obvious and doing really well in the club channel. We're also seeing very strong merchandising in Kingsford charcoal, which has been on a remarkable run over the last year, in particular as it relates to home hardware, which also is not tracked. And then we're starting to see what we talk -- started talking about perhaps 18 months ago our LOOP SKUs, low out-of-pocket SKUs, that are at the very low end of the dollar channel and also not tracked. To make an impact, we have 22 of such SKUs out there right now, and they're well received as consumers are looking for value at all ends of the spectrum. And that's starting to do pretty well. So I would point to those factors in particular, but perhaps to general strength across our portfolio outside tracked channels as consumers are looking for value and a lot of value is to be found in those nontracked channels."

And it might even be a little bit higher in fiscal '17 than we've seen in recent times, and that's just because we're seeing a shift to some larger pack sizes. We did pick up the incremental distribution at a major club account, which is great. It's a nice business. It's profitable, but it has lower gross margins.

And again, this is something that we anticipated about a year ago and is playing out about as foreshadowed. Growth is hard to come by in the U.S. We have a lot of growth, and we have a lot of growth coming from innovation. But broadly in the industry, there is not a lot of innovation around, which is why as competitors are looking for growth in a reasonably low commodity environment, they're investing in trade. And we're seeing that in various categories: Home Care and Glad. Our trash bags are 2 categories that we've mentioned in the past and that are playing out as we anticipated. And we can expect that elevated trade promotion environment to stay with us for the foreseeable future as commodities stay where they are. Our approach, perhaps, if you allow me, is certainly to an extent respond in kind so competition doesn't buy share from us that could erode the business in the long run. But our focus mainly is on earning market share, not buying market share, invest behind innovation, invest behind engaging with the consumer digitally, 2 things that have a long-term positive effect on our brand equity. So that can mean that we may be willing to temporarily accept share declines, for instance, on Glad, where we're seeing that right now, but always with an eye on the long-term health of our business and the profitability. So in a nutshell, elevated trade spend from branded competitors is likely to here to stay, and we're applying a balanced and disciplined approach, as you'd expect."

You got a couple of questions in there, but I just want to make sure for clarity's sake. Commodity costs were a tailwind in the fourth quarter, but they were less of a tailwind than what we had previously seen. It was about a 90 basis point tailwind. It had been about 180 in the previous 2 quarters. So to be clear, that certainly was nice. Looking forward, how do we feel about margins? We feel good about the EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps, driven by cost savings and lowering our SG&A. I would say, cost savings is on track. I feel good about pricing. Most of that will come from International, but let's see what happens with commodity costs. If that's different, we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. if we need to over the long term to protect our margins. We will likely get a modest commodity cost tailwind in fiscal '17 based on what we know today. Again, that will likely dissipate. But when we run the math, Ali, with these numbers, and you can take a look at web attachments, and I think it'll be pretty clear, that gets us to numbers that are about flat with some variability across the quarters. I think importantly as we look to fiscal '18 and beyond, I think our belief is that we're laying the groundwork for continued healthy margin expansion, 25 to 50 bps of EBIT.

And we think that the capabilities that we brought to the business are going to help us with e-commerce. But I will tell you, the biggest opportunity -- immediate opportunity, perhaps, for us is to take a brand that is heavily skewed towards the natural channel and in fact, the market leader in the natural channel to food, drug, mass, where the brand is arguably somewhat underrepresented and where the growth in the category is really taking off right now. And of course, that is an excellent fit with our capabilities because building categories and profitable brands with our customers in the food, drug, mass channel is the hallmark of what the Clorox Company has been known for. And we think that, that capability is playing very well for RenewLife, and that will be our first growth pillar for the business this fiscal year."

We've said that we like food enhancers as a category that we have capabilities in, and that is a growing trend in consumers and a very profitable category that has tailwinds. So we continue to be interested in that. And then we've always said that health and wellness is an area of opportunity for us, and that can have many legs. Certainly, the probiotics category and dietary supplements is one that we've made a foray in now. There are also other aspects of health and wellness that we're interested in. But to your specific question on OTC, that is less of a focus for us as a company. We like businesses that are on strategy and importantly, a great fit with our capabilities.

And I think if we do that, I think if we rebuild the margins in our International business, I do think you're going to see that number continue to float down. The other thing I would just point out, and this is really consistent with my opening comments on fiscal '17, we're coming off of 2 really good years in fiscal '15 and fiscal '16.

Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So turning to our commentary on the quarter. There are 3 key messages to take away from today's call: First, as planned, our fourth quarter results reflect significantly increased demand-building investments to support awareness, trial and distribution of our innovation pipeline; second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance as we made further progress against our 2020 Strategy. The choices we're making to drive long-term profitable growth are working, and Steve and Benno will talk more about that in a moment; and third, we're staying the course with our plans for fiscal year '17, recognizing we continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, a difficult competitive environment and commodity cost volatility as well as the comparison to the strong results we delivered in fiscal year '16. 
So with that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And then finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. 
So turning to Q4. Volume grew 7%, and sales grew 3%. And the variance between volume and sales growth reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, unfavorable product mix and increased levels of trade spending to drive awareness and trial on a number of our new product launches. U.S. growth, broadly speaking, was strong across all segments as well as in our international business when looked at on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 2-point impact from foreign currency, total company sales in the fourth quarter grew 5%. And if you look at just the U.S., which is more than 80% of our company's revenue, sales also grew 5%. So that was the fourth quarter. 
If you look at the fiscal year, volume grew 4%, with gains in all 4 of our reportable segments. We're certainly very pleased that our growth in shipments was so broad-based across all of the U.S. and international segments. Again for the year, fiscal '16, sales growth was 2%, reflecting strong volume growth; the benefit of price increases, primarily in international; about 0.5 points of growth from the RenewLife acquisition; as well as strong growth from innovation. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of increased demand spending behind innovation, again, primarily in our core business and nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. If you exclude the 3 points of unfavorable FX, full year sales increased 5 points. 
For fiscal year '16, again looking at the full year, we gained 0.01 point in market share across tracked channels, with 5 of our 8 U.S. business units holding or growing share, consistent with our strategy to invest more heavily in demand-building activities behind our growth businesses. Recently, we have seen increased competitive activity targeted in a couple of key categories, where spending is depressing pricing levels, the most prominent of which is the Bags and Wraps category. 
In addition, we have fully lapped last year's price increase in the Laundry business. And that category, which is about 10% of the company sales, has returned to its historical run rate of being about flat. 
And in Home Care, Disinfecting Wipes is another category we are monitoring for the impact of competitive activity. 
So with all these factors in mind, our outlook anticipates U.S. tracked channel categories to be up about 1% in fiscal year '17. Now it is important to note, however, that we do expect meaningful growth in fiscal year '17 in on-track channels, and that's going to be across a number of businesses, particularly Clorox wipes, Kingsford charcoal and Glad trash bags, and that growth won't be picked up in the traditional market share data. 
So with that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. I'm going to start with our Cleaning segment. In Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 12%, and sales increased 6%, driven primarily by Home Care and our Professional Products business. Looking at the fiscal year, Home Care, which is our largest domestic business unit, it surpassed $1 billion in sales for the first time in fiscal year '16, supported by strong growth of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, behind recent distribution gains in the club channel as well as continued base business strength, driven by increased investments in demand-building. Overall, Home Care delivered a second consecutive year of very strong market share growth. 
Turning to Laundry. Fourth quarter sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. And while market shares across our Laundry business were flat, Clorox Liquid Bleach grew share for the quarter, driven by incremental investments in demand creation, high levels of merchandising support and increased strength -- or continued strength, I should say, of our premium Clorox Splash-less bleach. 
And finally, our Professional Products business delivered double-digit volume and sales gains in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of professional cleaning products and our base health care products reflecting distribution gains. For the year, Professional Products delivered high single-digit sales gains on top of high single-digit gains a year ago. 
Turning to our Household segment. Fourth quarter volume increased 7%, and sales grew 5%, reflecting volume and sales growth in each business, along with the benefit of the May 2 acquisition of the RenewLife digestive health business. Our Glad Bags and Wraps business saw high single-digit volume growth following distribution gains and ongoing success from our OdorShield lineup, including Gain-scented trash bags. Our OdorShield innovation continues to support consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, which has resulted in a meaningful market share gain in our premium trash bag segment. And while the overall market share for our Bags and Wraps category was down due to declines in base trash bags, our strategic focus remains on the higher-margin premium bags. 
Turning to Cat Litter. Volume in the quarter grew as did sales behind our recent launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. We're pleased with the initial response to this launch, which contributed to market share growth in the quarter, and we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive awareness and trial in this highly competitive category. 
Looking at Charcoal. The business grew sales in Q4, and that's following a double-digit sales increase last quarter. Sales -- or I should say, results were driven by strong in-season merchandising and strength in the home hardware channel. Notably, in the last 3 years, we have added nearly $100 million in sales on this business, and that's on a base of about $500 million. So we've grown the business by nearly 20%. And again, that's just over the last 3 years. 
And lastly, within the Household segment, we feel very good about our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. While still very early, at only 2 months in, initial sales expectations are on track, and integration activities are going well. We feel great about the RenewLife employees who've joined the Clorox team, and we look forward to providing an update on this business in future quarters. 
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume and sales were up strongly, led by double-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees. Growth in Burt's Bees was driven primarily by innovation in lipsticks, tinted lip balm and BB cream, supported by growth as well in the base business. 
In our Food business, volume and sales also grew solidly, driven by our ranch-with bottled salad dressings. These salad dressings leverage the heritage and great taste of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing but with an additional flavor, such as sriracha, cucumber, cilantro lime and others. Since our launch of ranch-with dressings, which occurred about 18 months ago, we've gained about 14 share points in the ranch-with segment. Additionally, our Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinades continue to perform well with volume gains in Q4. 
Our Brita Water Filtration business delivered flat volume and sales in Q4, as gains in our pour-through and faucet-mount businesses were offset by declines in bottle on-the-go. And while overall share was down, share trends for pour-through and faucet-mount systems are improving. We are continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value supported by national television ads as well as through digital, public relations and social media campaigns centering on a partnership that kicked off in March between Brita and Stephen Curry, National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. 
And finally, turning to our last reportable segment, which is International. That segment represents a little less than 20% of our company sales. Volume was up about 1%, and sales were down 9%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, an impact that Clorox and our peer companies have experienced for over a year now. Excluding the 14% unfavorable impact in foreign currencies in this segment, sales for International grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners and nonbleach laundry additives behind our select demand creation investments. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year '16 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '17."
89450,370128169,1024526,"The Clorox Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year.

We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth across all our U.S. segments. Importantly, in fiscal year 2016, we delivered another year of margin expansion supported by productivity gains and strong cost savings. 
Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 7 points of volume growth, which included more than 1 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and about 1 point of pricing from International. These factors were partially offset by more than 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; about 2 points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by expanded distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a club channel customer; and nearly 1 point of incremental trade spending. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, a slight decline of 20 basis points, reflecting about 120 basis points from higher manufacturing and logistics costs, 50 basis points of negative impact from onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and about 50 basis points of negative impact from the voluntary recall of certain Liquid-Plumr products. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points from lower commodity costs, reflecting an expected slowdown in recent favorability trends, which we discussed last quarter. 
Selling and administrative expenses came in at 14.1% of sales, as expected. And as we previously communicated, we've significantly stepped up our advertising and sales promotion investments for the quarter, with an increase of $41 million or 27% versus year ago to about 12% of sales, to drive awareness and trial behind innovation and maintain the health of our core business. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26, a decrease of 13% versus the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher sales, more than offset by significantly higher advertising and sales promotion investments consistent with our strategy to support our brands. 
Onetime integration costs from the RenewLife acquisition also reduced fourth quarter earnings by about $0.03. And as we mentioned in the press release, onetime charges from the voluntary recall of a limited number of Liquid-Plumr products impacted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by nearly $0.04. 
Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew about 2%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth, which included about 0.5 point of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition and nearly 2 points of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of currency headwinds and nearly 1 point of higher trade spending. In fiscal year 2016, our product innovation programs delivered about 3 points of incremental sales growth. 
Gross margin for the fiscal year increased significantly by 150 basis points to 45.1% compared with 43.6% in fiscal year 2015, driven primarily by 140 basis points of favorable commodity costs, 130 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by about 140 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. 
Selling and administrative expenses for the full year came in at about 14% of the sales, essentially flat versus year ago and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of -- or less of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year 2016 was 10.2%, a full point higher than in fiscal year 2015. 
For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was about 34%. And net of all of these factors, fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared with $4.57 in the year ago period, an increase of 8%. 
Fiscal year 2016 free cash flow was $596 million or 10.3% of sales compared with $733 million or 13% of sales in the year ago period. The decrease in cash flow reflects higher tax payments in fiscal year 2016 and higher performance-based incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year '15 results, partially offset by earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. 
In fiscal year '17, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 10% to 12%, consistent with our long-term goal. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. 
At the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9, just slightly below our target range of 2 to 2.5. 
And now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, and here's how we're thinking of sales growth for the fiscal year. We anticipate U.S. category growth at about 1%, reflecting slower growth rates than what we saw in fiscal year 2016, driven, in large part, by increased competitive activity at the store shelf in a few categories. And we expect about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation pipeline. We also anticipate 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. Our sales outlook also includes 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, with more than half of the anticipated impact expected in the first half of the fiscal year and about 1 point of impact from unfavorable mix. Excluding the 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be about flat, following strong margin expansion in fiscal year 2016 as commodity cost tailwinds begin to dissipate. For perspective on commodities, we've recently seen prices begin to stabilize, and we anticipate a modest benefit from commodity favorability in fiscal year 2017 that will likely decline as we move through the fiscal year. 
We also anticipate unfavorable mix, including new distribution of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club channel customer. Importantly, our cost savings pipeline remains healthy and will help offset inflationary pressures and support higher margins over the long term. We anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points. That's on top of 50 basis points of growth in fiscal year 2016 and reflects lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation cost and cost savings. 
Next, as we mentioned in our press release, we're adopting a recently issued accounting standard update that requires tax impacts from stock-based compensation to flow through income taxes on the income statement, a change, we believe, brings better alignment between earnings and cash flows. Under the previous accounting standard, these differences were recognized in the balance sheet as -- instead of the income statement. 
As a result, we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, benefiting fiscal year diluted earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30. This change also means we'll likely see more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. To be clear, the adoption of this accounting standard will not change the company's total cash flows. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.58. Excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. 
Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to share with you additional thoughts on fiscal year 2017. We believe we have solid plans for fiscal year 2017 but continue to face a tough business environment as well as a comparison to strong fiscal year 2016 results. In light of our expectations of slower growth rates in our U.S. categories, we're closely watching the state of U.S. economy and our consumer. We also expect ongoing foreign currency headwinds to challenge the profitability of our international business. 
So here's how we're responding. First, we're going to stay the course with our 2020 Strategy. It certainly delivered very good results in fiscal year 26 (sic) [ 2016 ]. And in particular, we'll continue to invest strongly behind our U.S. brands and categories, particularly those categories with growth tailwinds and where we have a strong innovation platform. 
Next, we'll continue to execute our Go Lean Strategy in International, which includes taking pricing and continuing to drive cost savings to help rebuild our margins over time. We'll also continue investing strategically behind select international growth initiatives such as Burt's Bees distribution and product innovation. What's important to know is that International is a strategic part of our overall portfolio. We have leading brands across multiple countries, particularly midsized countries, with attractive growth rates and a strong consumer base. While it'll take time, we believe that we're taking the right actions to improve the profitability of our international business over the long term. 
In closing, we're certainly very pleased about our strong finish to fiscal year 2016 on top of the strong results in the year ago period. We're making the right choices to support the health of our core business and drive the success of our innovation programs, and we continue to support our margins by driving productivity gains and cost savings. 
With that, I will turn it over to Benno."

As Steve Austenfeld noted in his opening remarks, there are 3 key messages we have for you today: First, our Q4 results reflect incremental strategic investments to drive top line growth that, we believe, will be sustainable and profitable long term, keeping the core of our business healthy in a continued challenging macroeconomic environment. This approach is paying off, with increased volume and sales growth across our U.S. segments. 
Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year '16 performance and the progress we're making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators, which, I believe, will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come. 
On the top line, we delivered 2% sales growth or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the 3-point impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On the bottom line, we grew diluted earnings per share a very strong 8%, which includes our deliberately increased demand spending. We grew market share for the U.S. and International, supported by another strong year of innovation. 
We entered the digestive health category. Two months in, the transition is going well, and we're excited to bring the benefits of RenewLife's digestive health products to more consumers by building on the success the team has achieved with our proven distribution, marketing and innovation capabilities. And we delivered top-tier returns for our shareholders, doing it the right way, by investing in our brands, providing innovation and better value for our consumers and driving productivity and cost savings in order not -- to not just grow, but grow profitably. 
Third, we're staying the course for fiscal year '17. Our fiscal year 2017 outlook reflects a healthy base business while taking into account ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange, a difficult competitive environment and comparison against our strong fiscal year '16 performance. 
In addition, we're closely monitoring the general health of the U.S. economy and consumer. We have confidence in our strategy and will continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working well for us. We will continue to accelerate momentum in our portfolio with strong demand investments behind our brands. We will continue to drive our innovation program and deliver a robust collection of launches in the back half of the new fiscal year. We will continue to transform how we engage with consumers in the digital arena with industry-leading levels of spending that are yielding positive returns. We'll continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund these investments while also growing margins, and we will continue to draw on our extraordinarily engaged workforce that is driven to create solid and consistent value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions."

So we certainly would expect to get some benefit in the first half from the investments we made in the fourth quarter. As far as the ongoing investment level, in advertising, as we'd indicated on the previous call last quarter, we were about 10% of sales this fiscal year, fiscal '16. We anticipate a similar amount in fiscal '17. But to be clear, you will see variability across the quarters. We do like to time these investments when we've got innovation and news to talk about. So you could see it go up and down on the quarter, but I would say the incremental point we put in '16 will remain in '17 based on what we know today."

Let me try to build on the comments that I made at the opening, where we tried to break out for you our expectations around category growth, obviously, the benefit of RenewLife and innovation. Here's another way to think of it. As we look at the full year for fiscal '17, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Now included in that is about 2 points of foreign currency, which, by the way, offset about 2 points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition. So you can kind of net those out. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% on the core basis there, I would say the U.S. business continues to perform very well. We think we'll be well within this 2% to 4% long-term growth target that we have for our U.S. business. International, on a currency-neutral basis, we think will likely be in this 5% to 7% growth range. But obviously, when you layer in currencies, which are real, International is obviously going to be challenged next year, and it's certainly not going to be growing. So on balance, I would say we're feeling pretty good about the U.S. business. It's challenging in International, which is why we're really leaning in to rebuild the margins and accelerate profitable growth. But we think we have a solid outlook. Again, there'll be variability across the quarters as there always is, but we think this is a solid plan."

You've mentioned wipes, which is pretty obvious and doing really well in the club channel. We're also seeing very strong merchandising in Kingsford charcoal, which has been on a remarkable run over the last year, in particular as it relates to home hardware, which also is not tracked. And then we're starting to see what we talk -- started talking about perhaps 18 months ago our LOOP SKUs, low out-of-pocket SKUs, that are at the very low end of the dollar channel and also not tracked. To make an impact, we have 22 of such SKUs out there right now, and they're well received as consumers are looking for value at all ends of the spectrum. And that's starting to do pretty well. So I would point to those factors in particular, but perhaps to general strength across our portfolio outside tracked channels as consumers are looking for value and a lot of value is to be found in those nontracked channels."

We did pick up the incremental distribution at a major club account, which is great. It's a nice business. It's profitable, but it has lower gross margins.

And again, this is something that we anticipated about a year ago and is playing out about as foreshadowed. Growth is hard to come by in the U.S. We have a lot of growth, and we have a lot of growth coming from innovation. But broadly in the industry, there is not a lot of innovation around, which is why as competitors are looking for growth in a reasonably low commodity environment, they're investing in trade. And we're seeing that in various categories: Home Care and Glad. Our trash bags are 2 categories that we've mentioned in the past and that are playing out as we anticipated. And we can expect that elevated trade promotion environment to stay with us for the foreseeable future as commodities stay where they are. Our approach, perhaps, if you allow me, is certainly to an extent respond in kind so competition doesn't buy share from us that could erode the business in the long run. But our focus mainly is on earning market share, not buying market share, invest behind innovation, invest behind engaging with the consumer digitally, 2 things that have a long-term positive effect on our brand equity. So that can mean that we may be willing to temporarily accept share declines, for instance, on Glad, where we're seeing that right now, but always with an eye on the long-term health of our business and the profitability. So in a nutshell, elevated trade spend from branded competitors is likely to here to stay, and we're applying a balanced and disciplined approach, as you'd expect."

Commodity costs were a tailwind in the fourth quarter, but they were less of a tailwind than what we had previously seen. It was about a 90 basis point tailwind. It had been about 180 in the previous 2 quarters. So to be clear, that certainly was nice. Looking forward, how do we feel about margins? We feel good about the EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps, driven by cost savings and lowering our SG&A. I would say, cost savings is on track. I feel good about pricing. Most of that will come from International, but let's see what happens with commodity costs. If that's different, we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. if we need to over the long term to protect our margins. We will likely get a modest commodity cost tailwind in fiscal '17 based on what we know today. Again, that will likely dissipate. But when we run the math, Ali, with these numbers, and you can take a look at web attachments, and I think it'll be pretty clear, that gets us to numbers that are about flat with some variability across the quarters. I think importantly as we look to fiscal '18 and beyond, I think our belief is that we're laying the groundwork for continued healthy margin expansion, 25 to 50 bps of EBIT. And I think over the long term, gross margins will also continue to grow.

Certainly, what we've seen historically is that whenever there's a more significant uptick in commodities costs, that some of that trade promotion activity, and the Glad business, perhaps, is a prime example of that, generally tends to subside.

And we think that the capabilities that we brought to the business are going to help us with e-commerce. But I will tell you, the biggest opportunity -- immediate opportunity, perhaps, for us is to take a brand that is heavily skewed towards the natural channel and in fact, the market leader in the natural channel to food, drug, mass, where the brand is arguably somewhat underrepresented and where the growth in the category is really taking off right now. And of course, that is an excellent fit with our capabilities because building categories and profitable brands with our customers in the food, drug, mass channel is the hallmark of what the Clorox Company has been known for. And we think that, that capability is playing very well for RenewLife, and that will be our first growth pillar for the business this fiscal year."

We've said that we like food enhancers as a category that we have capabilities in, and that is a growing trend in consumers and a very profitable category that has tailwinds. So we continue to be interested in that. And then we've always said that health and wellness is an area of opportunity for us, and that can have many legs. Certainly, the probiotics category and dietary supplements is one that we've made a foray in now. There are also other aspects of health and wellness that we're interested in. But to your specific question on OTC, that is less of a focus for us as a company. We like businesses that are on strategy and importantly, a great fit with our capabilities.

And that's why, as we've talked for some time, we've got a glide path in place over the next 3 years with every function in this company to make sure we're being as productive as possible. And I think if we do that, I think if we rebuild the margins in our International business, I do think you're going to see that number continue to float down. The other thing I would just point out, and this is really consistent with my opening comments on fiscal '17, we're coming off of 2 really good years in fiscal '15 and fiscal '16.

I think we're making an assumption in fiscal '17 that the conversation will return to more normalized levels, although let's see what happens with the results of the business.

Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So that said, turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year '17, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So let me start with our top line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top line growth as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year '17, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year '16. 
It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories, we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only one speaking to the consumer. 
In addition, in the first quarter just ended, we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the r-ago quarter, both to support defensive [ph] activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation.
As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about 2 points of growth from our RenewLife acquisition, which closed in early May. Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth, but big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis. 
And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency-neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. But fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well.
Now turning to market shares. Our U.S. [indiscernible] share in tracked channels -- and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels, decreased 0.2 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data just cited does not reflect the significant gains we had [ph] on tracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel, online sales across our entire portfolio but in particular, Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel.
Looking at category growth. In the U.S., our categories were up about 0.2 of a point in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is constricting growth in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation, supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness.
So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. First quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity. 
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments as volumes are [ph] up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed.
Further, our total cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than 9 quarters of market share gains. 
In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the health care portions of the business.
Turning to our Laundry business. Sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover and color booster. [ph] However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-less, which is margin-accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio.
This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
Looking at our Household segment. We delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition. Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we're pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the [indiscernible] Fresh Step franchise.
In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment. However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well.
For example, we're continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line.
Also, our premium food storage bags, featuring Disney [ph] characters, are doing extremely well, and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that featured characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars [ph] to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars [ph] characters. 
In the Charcoal business, sales declined, but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year '16. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 building [ph] season.
And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about 2 quarters, RenewLife is on track with our expectations, the integration is going extremely well and we've already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business.
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales grew 2%. Within this segment, starting with our Food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high single-digit rate. However, in the quarter, sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter. Positively, market shares on our Food business continued to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings in our dip business.
Turning to Burt's Bees. Volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including the lipsticks, [indiscernible] lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We are very [ph] excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we work to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color.
Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business. While volume was flat, sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through [ph] filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we're building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, [ph] of the Golden State Warriors. [ph] Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time. 
Then lastly, looking at our International business. Volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, International was flat, which we believe is a really solid result, recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates. Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we've made in certain markets, which is in Canada, with the RenewLife business; and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for International, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%.
In addition, we continue to execute our go-in [ph] strategy across our International business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days in the fiscal year, we're very pleased with our top line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4% or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Now I'll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017."
89450,403832453,1070349,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sale",1219,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly 8 points of volume growth, including the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition and more than 1 point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about 3 points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about 2 points of negative foreign currencies. 
Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter when, notably, the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion.
The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International.
Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost savings pipeline.
For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies.
At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about 0.5 points versus a year ago and primarily due to impact of the RenewLife acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of RenewLife, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus a year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2-percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal '17 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update.
As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly, given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than a year ago, it was higher than we expected as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. 
Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, which came in at $59 million this quarter, was $111 million or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%.
Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%.
Turning to margin. We now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for [ph] gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated, we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year.
We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs.
In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items, including onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel.
Now we'll [ph] turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus a year ago from adopting the accounting standards update compared to the previously anticipated 4-point reduction. [ph] As I just mentioned, there's an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions, and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full year stock option exercises.
Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard. 
Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30. Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28.
In closing, we're pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities.
First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend [ph] against competitive activity we're seeing is select categories. Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in International in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics cost and our expectations for firming commodity costs.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I'm pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost savings opportunities. Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales.
Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations.
And now I'll turn it over to Benno."

First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth, growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term.
Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer, we're winning with the customer, we're running an operation that is effective and efficient and we're creating shareholder value. We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach.
Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment, we have momentum on our brands, and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy, and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent regional execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we're particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than 2/3 of U.S. net customer sales growing [ph] Household penetration. Increasing Household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth.
In International, we're staying the course. We're [indiscernible] headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of this business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples included were [ph] investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year.
We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense.
And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our RenewLife acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please."

Recall that commodities were still somewhat of a tailwind for us this quarter and, therefore, it didn't surprise us to see promotional activity across several of our categories, in particular perhaps Glad trash and the Disinfecting Wipes, to be higher and depressed that category growth somewhat. We did not see any -- in particular pantry stocking. So that again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point toward the particular strong growth that we've seen in nontracked channel. So this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in nontracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include, but are not limited to, Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter."

It also gives us certainly ammunition to continue the conversations that we have with retailers that price promotion, as we've noted to you and certainly to retailers in the past, don't really add value in our categories. And that over time, we expect the promotional spend in our categories to subside and our competitors to return to perhaps more rational behavior that drives our categories the right way, which is certainly something that we're focused on.

And to be specific, that's about 60 basis points. And we're feeling good about the investments we're making. We think they're going to generate nice returns going forward, but I think that number's a bit elevated in the first quarter just because of these investments we're making."

But broad-based, certainly, Disinfecting Wipes continues to grow household penetration, but I would point out that the Clorox brand as a whole is perhaps the shining star here, and that is not limited to Disinfecting Wipes but also includes toilet bowl cleaners and sprays. We have grown our Clorox brand into 4 million more households over the last year, and that is really unique in an environment like this when so many brands in our categories competitively are struggling to gain new households. So we feel good about our ability to connect with consumer space and innovation based on the change in our marketing approach and the increased focus on digital and the investments that we're making in our brands, with a particular focus also on offering superior value to consumers. So really broad-based and feeling good about that. Broad-based, when I say that, maybe a last word, also does mean that it includes our fuel [ph] businesses.

Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal '17 outlook as we previously communicated, and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our International business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we're taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities [ph] given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does, in fact, ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters, and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures. Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you'll likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year, you should see that number come down. And we've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident on the plans we have there."

So feeling good about the ROI that we're getting across all of the buckets, and have a really disciplined process in place that allows our businesses to measure ROI across all buckets, including digital, on at least a once a quarter basis and then shift orders around. And again, the best way for me to perhaps look at ROIs and show that the ROIs are really solid, is to go back to the growth that we're seeing in so many of our businesses, which is really been in broad-based this last quarter across all the U.S. segments and even in international. So we're feeling good about the ROI that we're seeing. And again, as mentioned perhaps also in the past, we'll leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs, and that could mean that in a business like Burt's Bees, we're investing in television because driving awareness by initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks delivers strong returns. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation. That's been working well for us. In store and some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita, we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there.

And I'd also point to a really a comp matter perhaps on that business because if you look at fiscal year '16, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter year ago, with sales up mid-to high single digits and profit up very significantly -- very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters. As you've noted, competitive price promotion are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here. Certainly responding in kind, and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to send strong signals to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending in price promotions. But we're staying balanced, we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So with how you see that is that we certainly are expecting -- accepting temporary share losses, in particular, in the lower profits and lower-priced segments. The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been ups and downs as you noted, Olivia, but if you look at the long-term trend, they've been very favorable and positive. And we know how to deal with situations like these, where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, then this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed."

Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit.
Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So that said, turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year '17, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So let me start with our top line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top line growth as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year '17, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year '16. 
It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories, we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only one speaking to the consumer. 
In addition, in the first quarter just ended, we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the r-ago quarter, both to support defensive activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation.
As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about 2 points of growth from our RenewLife acquisition, which closed in early May. Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth, but big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis. 
And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency-neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. But fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well.
Now turning to market shares. Our U.S. 13-week share in tracked channels -- and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels, decreased 0.2 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data just cited does not reflect the significant gains we've had in untracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel, online sales across our entire portfolio but in particular, Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel.
Looking at category growth. In the U.S., our categories were up about 0.2 of a point in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is constricting growth in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation, supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness.
So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. First quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity. 
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments as volume is up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed.
Further, our total cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than 9 quarters of market share gains. 
In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the health care portions of the business.
Turning to our Laundry business. Sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster. However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-less, which is margin-accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio.
This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
Looking at our Household segment. We delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition. Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we're pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the scoopable Fresh Step franchise.
In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment. However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well.
For example, we're continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line.
Also, our premium food storage bags, featuring Disney characters, are doing extremely well, and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that featured characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars characters. 
In the Charcoal business, sales declined, but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year '16. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 billing season.
And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about 2 quarters, RenewLife is on track with our expectations, the integration is going extremely well and we've already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business.
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales grew 2%. Within this segment, starting with our Food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high single-digit rate. However, in the quarter, sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter. Positively, market shares on our Food business continued to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings in our dip business.
Turning to Burt's Bees. Volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including the lipsticks, tinted lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We are mainly excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we work to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color.
Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business. While volume was flat, sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we're building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, of the Golden State Warriors. Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time. 
Then lastly, looking at our International business. Volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, International was flat, which we believe is a really solid result, recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates. Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we've made in certain markets, which is in Canada, with the RenewLife business; and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for International, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%.
In addition, we continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across our International business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days in the fiscal year, we're very pleased with our top line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4% or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Now I'll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017."
89450,403832453,1070542,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands.

We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly 8 points of volume growth, including the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition and more than 1 point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about 3 points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about 2 points of negative foreign currencies. 
Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter when, notably, the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion.
The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International.
Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost savings pipeline.
For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies.
At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about 0.5 points versus a year ago and primarily due to impact of the RenewLife acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of RenewLife, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus a year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2-percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal '17 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update.
As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly, given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than a year ago, it was higher than we expected as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. 
Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, which came in at $59 million this quarter, was $111 million or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%.
Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%.
Turning to margin. We now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated, we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year.
We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs.
In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items, including onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel.
Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus a year ago from adopting the accounting standards update compared to the previously anticipated 4-point reduction. As I just mentioned, there's an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions, and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full year stock option exercises.
Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard. 
Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30. Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28.
In closing, we're pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities.
First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend against competitive activity we're seeing is select categories. Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in International in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics cost and our expectations for firming commodity costs.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I'm pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost savings opportunities. Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales.
Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations.
And now I'll turn it over to Benno."

First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth, growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term.
Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer, we're winning with the customer, we're running an operation that is effective and efficient and we're creating shareholder value. We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach.
Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment, we have momentum on our brands, and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy, and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent regional execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we're particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than 2/3 of U.S. net customer sales growing household penetration. Increasing household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth.
In International, we're staying the course, withstanding headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of this business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples included were investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year.
We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense.
And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our RenewLife acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please."

But can you talk about how that is driving volume or velocity,  if you will, among those categories?

But number two, do you think there has been pantry stocking on the part of consumers because there hasn't been so much promotional activity?

We did not see any -- in particular pantry stocking. So that again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point toward the particular strong growth that we've seen in nontracked channel. So this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in nontracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include, but are not limited to, Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter."

And we expect that initiative to continue to grow in its year 2 and year 3 post this launch. We view cosmetics in general as a potential growth platform for the Burt's business, and we'll invest behind that. And lipsticks, in particular, has been very well received by consumers but also by the press. Notably, we've gained 2 Lipsticks of the Year awards by 2 leading magazines, Cosmopolitan and Allure.

Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal '17 outlook as we previously communicated, and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our International business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we're taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does, in fact, ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters, and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures. Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you'll likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year, you should see that number come down. And we've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident on the plans we have there."

So feeling good about the ROI that we're seeing. And again, as mentioned perhaps also in the past, we leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs, and that could mean that in a business like Burt's Bees, we're investing in television because driving awareness behind initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks delivers strong return. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in-store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation. That's been working well for us in store. And then some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita, we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there.

And I'd also point to really a comp matter perhaps on that business because, if you look at fiscal year '16, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter a year ago, with sales up mid- to high single digits and profit up very significantly, very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters. As we've noted, competitive price promotions are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here. Certainly responding in kind, and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to set a strong signal to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending in price promotions. But we're staying balanced and we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So what -- how you see that is -- that we certainly are expecting -- accepting temporary share losses, in particular, in the lower profits and lower-priced segments. The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over a longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been these ups and downs as you noted, Olivia, but if you look at the long-term trends, they've been very favorable and positive. And we know how to deal with situations like these where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, then this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed."

So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat.

So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat. As I said in my opening comments, we now anticipate gross margin will be down modestly on the year. Part of that reflects mix, which was a little bit less favorable than we had thought. In the first quarter, it was more unfavorable than we had originally expected. But the biggest change has to do with our expectations for resin prices, which we think are firming up a little bit quicker than we had originally anticipated. So at this point, we think gross margin will be down modestly. It assumes commodity costs in total are about flat. So it will dissipate as we have thought. It assumes that we'll still have some drag associated with mix, which we've seen for some time. But importantly, we feel good about our cost savings. And I would also say that, at this point, we have got solid plans in place to deliver EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps for the full year. And I would also just point out, over the long term, keep in mind we're coming off of some very strong gross margins over the last couple of years, but I feel very good about our plans to expand gross margins and total margins over the long term behind our cost savings programs and also as we lower S&A costs over time. And as we talked, we've got pricing power, so we're comping a pretty tough number in the year-ago period at 220 basis points of gross margin expansion, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the plans we have in place, both for the intermediate and long term."

We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.
Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit.
Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So that said, turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year '17, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So let me start with our top line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top line growth as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year '17, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year '16. 
It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories, we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only one speaking to the consumer. 
In addition, in the first quarter just ended, we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the year-ago quarter, both to support defensive activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation.
As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about 2 points of growth from our RenewLife acquisition, which closed in early May. Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth, but big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency neutral basis. 
And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. But fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well.
Now turning to market shares. Our U.S. 13-week share in tracked channels, and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels, decreased 0.2 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data just cited does not reflect the significant gains we've had in untracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel, online sales across our entire portfolio but in particular, Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel.
Looking at category growth. In the U.S., our categories were up about 0.2% in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is restricting growth in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation, supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness.
So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. First quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity. 
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments as volume is up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed.
Further, our toilet cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than 9 quarters of market share gains. 
In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the health care portions of the business.
Turning to our Laundry business. Sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster. However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-less, which is margin-accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio.
This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
Looking at our Household segment. We delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition. Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we're pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the scoopable Fresh Step franchise.
In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment. However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well.
For example, we're continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line.
Also, our premium food storage bags, featuring Disney characters, are doing extremely well, and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that feature characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars characters. 
In the Charcoal business, sales declined, but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year '16. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 grilling season.
And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about 2 quarters, RenewLife is on track with our expectations, the integration is going extremely well and we've already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business.
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales grew 2%. Within this segment, starting with our Food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high single-digit rate. However, in the quarter, sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter. Positively, market shares on our Food business continued to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings and our dip business.
Turning to Burt's Bees. Volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including the lipsticks, tinted lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We remain excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we look to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color.
Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business. While volume was flat, sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we're building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, of the Golden State Warriors. Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time. 
Then lastly, looking at our International business. Volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, International was flat, which we believe is a really solid result, recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates. Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we've made in certain markets, which is in Canada, with the RenewLife business; and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for International, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%.
In addition, we continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across our International business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're very pleased with our top line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4% or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Now I'll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017."
89450,403832453,1070848,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sale",1215,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly 8 points of volume growth, including the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition and more than 1 point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about 3 points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about 2 points of negative foreign currencies. 
Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter when, notably, the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion.
The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International.
Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost savings pipeline.
For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies.
At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about 0.5 points versus a year ago and primarily due to impact of the RenewLife acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of RenewLife, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus a year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2-percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal '17 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update.
As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly, given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than a year ago, it was higher than we expected as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. 
Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, which came in at $59 million this quarter, was $111 million or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%.
Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%.
Turning to margin. We now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated, we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year.
We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs.
In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items, including onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel.
Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus a year ago from adopting the accounting standards update compared to the previously anticipated 4-point reduction. As I just mentioned, there's an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions, and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full year stock option exercises.
Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard. 
Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30. Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28.
In closing, we're pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities.
First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend against competitive activity we're seeing is select categories. Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in International in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics cost and our expectations for firming commodity costs.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I'm pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost savings opportunities. Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales.
Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations.
And now I'll turn it over to Benno."

Here's what we hope you will take away from today's call. First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for C",460,"Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Here's what we hope you will take away from today's call. 
First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth, growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term.
Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer, we're winning with the customer, we're running an operation that is effective and efficient and we're creating shareholder value. We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach.
Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment, we have momentum on our brands, and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy, and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent retail execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we're particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than 2/3 of U.S. net customer sales growing household penetration. Increasing household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth.
In International, we're staying the course, withstanding headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of this business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples include that we're investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year.
We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense.
And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our RenewLife acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please."

But number two, do you think there has been pantry stocking on the part of consumers because there hasn't been so much promotional activity?

Just to put in perspective, as Steve noted, category growth was somewhat lower over the last 13 weeks due to the promotional activity that we're seeing. Recall that commodities were still somewhat of a tailwind for us this quarter and, therefore, it didn't surprise us to see promotional activity across several of our categories, in particular perhaps Glad trash and the Disinfecting Wipes, to be higher and depress that category growth somewhat. We did not see any -- in particular pantry stocking. So that again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point toward the particular strong growth that we've seen in nontracked channel. So this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in nontracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include, but are not limited to, Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter."

It also gives us certainly ammunition to continue the conversations that we have with retailers that price promotion, as we've noted to you and certainly to retailers in the past, don't really add value in our categories. And that over time, we expect the promotional spend in our categories to subside and our competitors to return to perhaps more rational behavior that drives our categories the right way, which is certainly something that we're focused on.

And we expect that initiative to continue to grow in its year 2 and year 3 post its launch. We view cosmetics in general as a potential growth platform for the Burt's business, and we'll invest behind that. And lipsticks, in particular, has been very well received by consumers but also by the press. Notably, we've gained 2 Lipsticks of the Year awards by 2 leading magazines, Cosmopolitan and Allure. And consumers really follow the recommendations that publications like those 2 make. And we're feeling very good about this launch and think that doing TV advertising as we're doing now is another down payment in the long-term success, not only of Burt's Bees cosmetics but the Burt's Bees franchise as a whole."

And to be specific, that's about 60 basis points. And we're feeling good about the investments we're making.

Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal '17 outlook as we previously communicated, and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our International business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we're taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does, in fact, ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters, and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures. Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you'll likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year, you should see that number come down. And we've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident on the plans we have there."

And then the second opportunity is to make stores in food/drug/mass, so our traditional stronghold retailers where, as a company, we have very strong capabilities and strong track record of success. We're doing a nice job to expand distribution there, and we're starting to see the benefits of that. But by no means are we done with that. But we're certainly pleased with the progress. This business is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. We're starting with distribution expansion. As time goes by, we will then plug in our marketing and innovation machine, and we're certainly looking very closely at the international business as well. One example that Steve Austenfeld mentioned earlier was the really noteworthy growth we've had in the Canadian business, and we think that there's a lot more to come. So this is a good acquisition for us. That's on track and doing exactly what we hoped it would do for us."

How nimble are you in terms of changing up the buckets of spending behind promotion and advertising?

What we said is that, for this fiscal year, we think we have about the right spend, and we expect advertising and sales promotion to be in the 10% range, which is consistent with last year and certainly increased versus previous years. So feeling good about the ROI that we're getting across all of the buckets, and have a really disciplined process in place that allows our businesses to measure ROI across all buckets, including digital, on at least a once-a-quarter basis and then shift orders around. And again, the best way for me to perhaps look at ROIs and show that the ROIs are really solid is to go back to the growth that we're seeing in so many of our businesses, which has really been broad-based this last quarter across all the U.S. segments and even in International. So feeling good about the ROI that we're seeing. And again, as mentioned perhaps also in the past, we leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs, and that could mean that in a business like Burt's Bees, we're investing in television because driving awareness behind initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks delivers strong return. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in-store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation. That's been working well for us in store. And then some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita, we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there. So feeling good about the ability to be nimble and flexible and shifting the dollars to where we're seeing the ROIs. And again, I would point to the strong top line growth as a proof point."

And I'd also point to really a comp matter perhaps on that business because, if you look at fiscal year '16, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter a year ago, with sales up mid- to high single digits and profit up very significantly, very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters. As we've noted, competitive price promotions are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here. Certainly responding in kind, and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to send a strong signal to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending and price promotions. But we're staying balanced and we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So what -- how you see that is -- that we certainly are expecting -- accepting temporary share losses, in particular, in the lower profits and lower-priced segments. The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is still growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over a longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been these ups and downs as you noted, Olivia, but if you look at the long-term trends, they've been very favorable and positive. And we know how to deal with situations like these where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, then this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed."

So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat. As I said in my opening comments, we now anticipate gross margin will be down modestly on the year. Part of that reflects mix, which was a little bit less favorable than we had thought. In the first quarter, it was more unfavorable than we had originally expected. But the biggest change has to do with our expectations for resin prices, which we think are firming up a little bit quicker than we had originally anticipated. So at this point, we think gross margin will be down modestly. It assumes commodity costs in total are about flat. So it will dissipate as we have thought. It assumes that we'll still have some drag associated with mix, which we've seen for some time. But importantly, we feel good about our cost savings. And I would also say that, at this point, we have got solid plans in place to deliver EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps for the full year. And I would also just point out, over the long term, keep in mind we're coming off of some very strong gross margins over the last couple of years, but I feel very good about our plans to expand gross margins and total margins over the long term behind our cost savings programs and also as we lower S&A costs over time. And as we talked, we've got pricing power, so we're comping a pretty tough number in the year-ago period at 220 basis points of gross margin expansion, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the plans we have in place, both for the intermediate and long term."

We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.
Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit.
Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.
Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today’s earnings release.
Please recognize that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So that said, turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year '17, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.
So let me start with our top line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top line growth as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year '17, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year '16. 
It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories, we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only one speaking to the consumer. 
In addition, in the first quarter just ended, we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the year-ago quarter, both to support defensive activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation.
As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about 2 points of growth from our RenewLife acquisition, which closed in early May. Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth, but big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency neutral basis. 
And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. But fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well.
Now turning to market shares. Our U.S. 13-week share in tracked channels, and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels, decreased 0.2 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data just cited does not reflect the significant gains we've had in untracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel, online sales across our entire portfolio but in particular, Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel.
Looking at category growth. In the U.S., our categories were up about 0.2% in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is restricting growth in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation, supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness.
So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment. First quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity. 
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments as volume is up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed.
Further, our toilet cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than 9 quarters of market share gains. 
In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the health care portions of the business.
Turning to our Laundry business. Sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster. However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-less, which is margin-accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio.
This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.
Looking at our Household segment. We delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition. Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we're pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the scoopable Fresh Step franchise.
In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment. However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well.
For example, we're continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line.
Also, our premium food storage bags, featuring Disney characters, are doing extremely well, and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that feature characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars characters. 
In the Charcoal business, sales declined, but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year '16. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 grilling season.
And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired RenewLife digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about 2 quarters, RenewLife is on track with our expectations, the integration is going extremely well and we've already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business.
Turning to our Lifestyle segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales grew 2%. Within this segment, starting with our Food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high single-digit rate. However, in the quarter, sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter. Positively, market shares on our Food business continued to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings and our dip business.
Turning to Burt's Bees. Volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including the lipsticks, tinted lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We remain excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we look to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color.
Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business. While volume was flat, sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we're building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, of the Golden State Warriors. Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time. 
Then lastly, looking at our International business. Volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, International was flat, which we believe is a really solid result, recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates. Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we've made in certain markets, which is in Canada, with the RenewLife business; and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for International, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%.
In addition, we continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across our International business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level.
So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're very pleased with our top line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4% or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Now I'll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017."
89450,403832453,1071746,"The Clorox Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Clorox Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sale",1215,"Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.
Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly 8 points of volume growth, including the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition and more than 1 point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about 3 points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about 2 points of negative foreign currencies. 
Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter when, notably, the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion.
The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International.
Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost savings pipeline.
For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies.
At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about 0.5 points versus a year ago and primarily due to impact of the RenewLife acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of RenewLife, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales.
Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus a year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2-percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal '17 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update.
As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly, given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than a year ago, it was higher than we expected as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels.
Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. 
Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, which came in at $59 million this quarter, was $111 million or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%.
Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative 2-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%.
Turning to margin. We now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated, we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year.
We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs.
In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items, including onetime integration costs related to the RenewLife acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel.
Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus a year ago from adopting the accounting standards update compared to the previously anticipated 4-point reduction. As I just mentioned, there's an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions, and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full year stock option exercises.
Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard. 
Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30. Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28.
In closing, we're pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities.
First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend against competitive activity we're seeing is select categories. Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in International in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics cost and our expectations for firming commodity costs.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I'm pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost savings opportunities. Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales.
Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations.
And now I'll turn it over to Benno."

First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth, growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term.
Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer, we're winning with the customer, we're running an operation that is effective and efficient and we're creating shareholder value. We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach.
Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment, we have momentum on our brands, and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy, and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent retail execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we're particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than 2/3 of U.S. net customer sales growing household penetration. Increasing household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth.
In International, we're staying the course, withstanding headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of this business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.
Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples include that we're investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year.
We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense.
And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our RenewLife acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential. 
And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please."

Recall that commodities were still somewhat of a tailwind for us this quarter and, therefore, it didn't surprise us to see promotional activity across several of our categories, in particular perhaps Glad trash and the Disinfecting Wipes, to be higher and depress that category growth somewhat. We did not see any -- in particular pantry stocking. So that again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point toward the particular strong growth that we've seen in nontracked channel. So this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in nontracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include, but are not limited to, Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter."

It also gives us certainly ammunition to continue the conversations that we have with retailers that price promotion, as we've noted to you and certainly to retailers in the past, don't really add value in our categories. And that over time, we expect the promotional spend in our categories to subside and our competitors to return to perhaps more rational behavior that drives our categories the right way, which is certainly something that we're focused on.

We view cosmetics in general as a potential growth platform for the Burt's business, and we'll invest behind that. And lipsticks, in particular, has been very well received by consumers but also by the press. Notably, we've gained 2 Lipsticks of the Year awards by 2 leading magazines, Cosmopolitan and Allure.

And then according to your always helpful retail pricing actions, I guess, disclosure in the press release, it doesn't look like you've actually taking any U.S. pricing since like February '15. And a twist on the question from earlier around trade spend, do you think you'll be able to take pricing up as in product manufacturing costs, granted maybe less than what we saw this quarter, but those kind of ramp up in an inflationary environment that's growing obviously in the commodities directly. Do you think you'll be able to take pricing up to offset that or do you think it'd be more difficult going forward? And depending on your answer there, on the other side of the operating margin story and obviously the SG&A bucket, which has been great. Right now, 4 -- 14% is the target. How much more fuel is left on the tank there from a cutting on SG&A perspective?"

Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal '17 outlook as we previously communicated, and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our International business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we're taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does, in fact, ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters, and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures. Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you'll likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year, you should see that number come down. And we've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident on the plans we have there."

So investing in our brands and investing in sales growth and making sure it's profitable is what it's about. And I think that's what we're doing particularly well.

And that's because our recipe continues to be to invest in our brands. Our innovation is, as you know, margin-accretive, and we have a lot of innovation out there right now. And particularly, a robust innovation program in the back half. So for us, as we look at the pricing environment and the retail environment, it's frankly relatively stable. And what retailers continue to want is growth, and they want growth the right way.

This business is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. We're starting with distribution expansion. As time goes by, we will then plug in our marketing and innovation machine, and we're certainly looking very closely at the international business as well. One example that Steve Austenfeld mentioned earlier was the really noteworthy growth we've had in the Canadian business, and we think that there's a lot more to come.

How nimble are you in terms of changing up the buckets of spending behind promotion and advertising?

What we said is that, for this fiscal year, we think we have about the right spend, and we expect advertising and sales promotion to be in the 10% range, which is consistent with last year and certainly increased versus previous years. So feeling good about the ROI that we're getting across all of the buckets, and have a really disciplined process in place that allows our businesses to measure ROI across all buckets, including digital, on at least a once-a-quarter basis and then shift orders around. And again, the best way for me to perhaps look at ROIs and show that the ROIs are really solid is to go back to the growth that we're seeing in so many of our businesses, which has really been broad-based this last quarter across all the U.S. segments and even in International. So feeling good about the ROI that we're seeing. And again, as mentioned perhaps also in the past, we leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs, and that could mean that in a business like Burt's Bees, we're investing in television because driving awareness behind initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks delivers strong return. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in-store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation. That's been working well for us in store. And then some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita, we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there. So feeling good about the ability to be nimble and flexible and shifting the dollars to where we're seeing the ROIs. And again, I would point to the strong top line growth as a proof point."

And I'd also point to really a comp matter perhaps on that business because, if you look at fiscal year '16, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter a year ago, with sales up mid- to high single digits and profit up very significantly, very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters. As we've noted, competitive price promotions are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here. Certainly responding in kind, and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to send a strong signal to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending and price promotions. But we're staying balanced and we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So what -- how you see that is -- that we certainly are expecting -- accepting temporary share losses, in particular, in the lower profits and lower-priced segments. The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is still growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over a longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been these ups and downs as you noted, Olivia, but if you look at the long-term trends, they've been very favorable and positive. And we know how to deal with situations like these where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, then this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed."

So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat. As I said in my opening comments, we now anticipate gross margin will be down modestly on the year. Part of that reflects mix, which was a little bit less favorable than we had thought. In the first quarter, it was more unfavorable than we had originally expected. But the biggest change has to do with our expectations for resin prices, which we think are firming up a little bit quicker than we had originally anticipated. So at this point, we think gross margin will be down modestly. It assumes commodity costs in total are about flat. So it will dissipate as we have thought. It assumes that we'll still have some drag associated with mix, which we've seen for some time. But importantly, we feel good about our cost savings. And I would also say that, at this point, we have got solid plans in place to deliver EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps for the full year. And I would also just point out, over the long term, keep in mind we're coming off of some very strong gross margins over the last couple of years, but I feel very good about our plans to expand gross margins and total margins over the long term behind our cost savings programs and also as we lower S&A costs over time. And as we talked, we've got pricing power, so we're comping a pretty tough number in the year-ago period at 220 basis points of gross margin expansion, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the plans we have in place, both for the intermediate and long term."
