Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter",1715,"Thank you, , and welcome, everyone, to today's call. 
Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic by far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive affect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card, investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business. 
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1 and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day-parts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks and mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers. 
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere.  Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of our original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra premiums Starbucks Reserve brand. 
Our plans to build over 500 coffee forward Starbucks Reserves stores in global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods during intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roasted ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us. 
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand including our efficiency in in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to millennials. 
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CPG distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing and our business and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
The key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia last week. We began in , China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth annual China partner and family forum. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect the parents that our partners have for their children and in their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that China have to deliver extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all Starbucks partners and their families was Jack ma, founder of Alibaba. 
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through T-Mo, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks fits, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The that the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for us to move on the next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in an important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand the distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. 
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business.  Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchase the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own. 
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has the Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great engineering company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I'd like to build on Howard's comment and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1.

I'd like to build on Howard's comment and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail. 
Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region, and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance. 
On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have an operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over. 
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our package Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks gift cards once again enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. This holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum. 
This dynamic was reflected in the performance of each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment has another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.  Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation such as Teavana shake and iced Teas and cold brew coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth. 
And our morning day-part saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-parts, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches, which is up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio. 
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have and the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region. 
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all day-parts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners and CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and  tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We recently began to see the effects of the region's resilience and the recovery. we opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazhakstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we have Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segment significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores on average having a holiday display in December. In addition, our Limited Time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter.  Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted strong dollar growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks hot cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw strength across several channels of business including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North America coffee partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 13.4%, driven by new product innovation in our cappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite. 
Beyond the U.S., we continued to successfully execute against plan to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with is on track for midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building in our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks Latte K-Cup for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.

Key element of our strategy is our Starbucks rewards loyalty program, and with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own. 
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world. 
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions was paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January. 
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars. 
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help to shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make our loyalty customer. Will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
Number 4, digital media. Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand. 
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks rewards program and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.

34745,311935385,920097,"Starbucks Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 that another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increa",1844,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 that another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in the single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks Japan related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner and digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. The Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage an excellent management around cost of goods sold. 
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast scope of our partner and digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016 despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher your income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect preacquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy.  Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP would be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from '15 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth in operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by some of the margins in our business resulting, from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength in our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15% as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American coffee partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorably were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1.  As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite overperformance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous stated range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to again deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full year. 
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest new stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a portion of the deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact of the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 910 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. 
outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34%  and 35%. And we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1. And we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15%, and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark.  The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted disciplined growth across the business with appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits into the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term.  We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

And it's followed best practice we have with beverage for many years. So they're very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on our breakfast but lunch.

The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest glass new stores we have ever opened. In terms of day-part, I think in addition to technology with everyone that there will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that are now almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that for the most part without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our mind, if we look at every market we've opened around the world including those markets in China, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically, but enough to give us great -- not hope, but vindication in those stores that are open the longest, Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. so if you look of the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on technology we talked about, and then the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that I said when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. anyone on the call who is in any way dissuaded by our commitment and our success in China as a result of the 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric."

And that seismic change was due, in large part, to e-commerce and smartphone shopping.

Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business. And we finished very strong for the quarter. So we -- we've insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that were  -- will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000. And in addition to what I said about China and 150 stores that we opened best of class, the stores that we opened in the U.S  this year are also best of class terms of revenue and return on investment. So we see no signs whatsoever that we are going to hit in any way by the seismic change in consumer behavior because we invested ahead of the growth curve, and we continue to invest in those things that are customer-facing, partner-facing and technology."

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven. Margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going that toward 20% over next handful of years in EMEA. And so that's a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track with what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we see some softening. And now it's coming back. so full year, we haven't changed our guidance. And we're not at all changing in the long term, our belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And then CAP again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move us up to low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets the CAP right up of there with the Americas business. So again strong revenue growth, we'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect we can look at since acquisition. And we're just getting started in during that business with the team over there. Howard talked about our China, and again, we've never been more bullish in that. So international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I just want to remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we significantly increased our buybacks to t the tune of roughly double already this quarter what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet. We'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. That number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that's number increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little harder as we discussed."

Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic. By far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card and investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business. 
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1, and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day-parts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results, despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers. 
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. 
Our plans to build over 500 coffee-forward Starbucks Reserves stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods doing intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roast and ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us. 
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to millennials. 
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business, and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum (sic) [China Partner Family Forum]. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect of the parents of our partners have for their children and in their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all the Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba. 
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through T-Mo [ph], our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffeting of the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. 
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business. Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchase the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and at the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own. 
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has a Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I'd like to build on Howard's comment and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1.

I'd like to build on Howard's comment and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail. 
Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region, and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance. 
On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over. 
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks Gift Cards, once again, enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. In this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift Cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum. 
This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.  
Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation, such as Teavana Shaken Iced Teas and Cold Brew Coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth. 
And our morning day-part saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-parts, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio. 
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on Mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have and the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region. 
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all day-parts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently began to see the effects of that region's resilience and the recovery. We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by the strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segment significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores, on average, having a holiday display in December. In addition, our limited time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks Hot Cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw a strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 30.4%, driven by new product innovation in our cappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite. 
Beyond the U.S., we've continued to successfully execute against plan to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building from our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.

A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own. 
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world. 
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January. 
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars. 
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customer. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand. 
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program, and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.

34745,311935385,920135,"Starbucks Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.

We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. 
As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks-Japan-related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner and digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage and excellent management around cost of goods sold. 
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner and digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016, despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By a way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect 3 acquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy. Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from '15 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our licensed business, resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American Coffee Partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1. As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite over performance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to, again, deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full year. 
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 4 -- 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of a deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. 
This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 910 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. 
The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1, and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter-end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15% and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and, as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark. The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted, disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

I think, number one that's driving it is that as we've continued to tune the food portfolio, I think we're -- we certainly have dialed in, in the morning day-part, what we've done to complement the food items with the breakfast sandwiches, I think, for lunch and afternoon day-part, the Bistro Boxes and how we're dialing in there and then we're laying the foundation for evening. So I think it's, number one, it's the innovation we've done in food and how that's been presented to the customer in the stores. I think that's the big part of it. Certainly, digital helps because we could target offerings to get customers to try new things. And so what we find is, once we encourage trial, that starts to lead to repeatability. So let me hand it over to Cliff to add a little more color behind what we're doing in the stores that will drive that."

We now have some authority in our breakfast sandwich range and we continue to refine both the product and our availability. And we enhance our skills at both offering the product to customers through displays and through the partner confidence in sharing the product. One of the changes we made in Q2 last year was we introduced a food benefit, to the partners in the U.S. who are working on shift, they could have free food. And that I think has really helped them build confidence. And it's followed best practice we've had with beverage for many years, so they're very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on breakfast but now in lunch. And Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65%. And we own that format, and we consider that another way that we can grow our range. So it's about having a confidence around food, having an authority around food and working on quality, variety, availability and on selling skills of our partners. So all in all, it's going well, and we have a lot more runway to continue to build food."

So our growth in China is not only in terms of the 500 stores per year that we're going to add over the next 5 years, it's overlaying that growth with technology that we strongly believe is going to be adopted at a quicker pace than the U.S. consumer has because of how technology is embedded in the Chinese consumer's life."

We have over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened. In terms of day-part, I think, in addition to the technology we talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that, for the most part, without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our minds, if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great, not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been opened the longest on Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. So if you look of the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on the technology we talked about and then we know the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business.

So I think we said 3 years ago publicly that we began to envision that there would be a seismic change in consumer behavior. And that seismic change was due, in large part, to e-commerce and smartphone shopping. I think today, in the headlines you've seen just in the last 3 weeks, store closures of almost 50 Macy's stores, 150 Walmart stores, you got to ask yourself, what's going to happen to the future of many of those malls that are anchored by those big-box retailers? Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in the country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business, and we finished very strong for the quarter. So we are -- we've insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000. And in addition to what I said about China and the 150 stores that we just opened best-of-class, the stores that we've opened in the U.S. this year are also best-of-class in terms of revenue and return on investment. So we see no signs whatsoever that we are going to be hit in any way by the seismic change in consumer behavior because we invested ahead of the growth curve and we continue to invest in those things that are customer-facing, partner-facing and technology."

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven, margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that's a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we're seeing some softening, and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance, and we're not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move up towards the low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP. This year, the numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition, and we're just getting started in growing that business with a team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is very strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter of what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little bit harder as we've discussed."

          Thank you, Durga, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic. By far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card and investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business. 
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1, and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day-parts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results, despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic, foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers. 
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. 
Our plans to build over 500 coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods doing intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roast and ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us. 
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to millennials. 
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business, and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum (sic) [China Partner Family Forum]. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect of the parents of our partners have for their children and then their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all the Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba. 
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through Tmall, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffeting of the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. 
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business. Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchased the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and at the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own. 
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has a Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

Thanks, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail. 
Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region, and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance. 
On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over. 
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks Gift Cards, once again, enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. In this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift Cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum. 
This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.  
Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation, such as Teavana Shaken Iced Teas and Cold Brew Coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth. 
And our morning day-part saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-parts, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio. 
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on Mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have and the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region. 
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all day-parts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently begun to see the effects of that region's resilience and the recovery. We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by the strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segments significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores, on average, having a holiday display in December. In addition, our limited time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks Hot Cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw a strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 30.4%, driven by new product innovation in our frappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite. 
Beyond the U.S., we've continued to successfully execute against plans to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building from our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.

          Thanks, Mike. A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own. 
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world. 
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January. 
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars. 
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customers. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand. 
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program, and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.

Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. 
As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks-Japan-related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner and digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage and excellent management around cost of goods sold. 
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner and digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016, despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By a way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect 3 acquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy. Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from 2015 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our licensed business, resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American Coffee Partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1. As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite over performance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to, again, deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full year. 
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 4 -- 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of a deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. 
The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1, and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter-end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15% and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and, as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark. The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted, disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

I think, number one that's driving it is that as we've continued to tune the food portfolio, I think we're -- we certainly have dialed in, in the morning day-part, what we've done to complement the food items with the breakfast sandwiches, I think, for lunch and afternoon day-part, the Bistro Boxes and how we're dialing in there and then we're laying the foundation for evening. So I think it's, number one, it's the innovation we've done in food and how that's been presented to the customer in the stores. I think that's the big part of it. Certainly, digital helps because we could target offerings to get customers to try new things. And so what we find is, once we encourage trial, that starts to lead to repeatability. So let me hand it over to Cliff to add a little more color behind what we're doing in the stores that will drive that."

One of the changes we made in Q2 last year was we introduced a food benefit with partners in the U.S. who are working on shift, they could have free food. And that I think has really helped them build confidence. And it's followed best practice we've had with beverage for many years, so they're very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on breakfast but now in lunch. And Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65%. And we own that format, and we consider that another way that we can grow our range. So it's about having a confidence around food, having an authority around food and working on quality, variety, availability and on selling skills of our partners. So all in all, it's going well, and we have a lot more runway to continue to build food."

          The question is on the partner investments that you've been doing in the Americas. And certainly, it's very evident in this quarter as store operating expense was up 80 basis points year-over-year despite the 9% comp. So -- and my question is how much do you view that investment that you've been making in partners, really, as a specific driver of comps over the past 4 quarters? And as we think about lapping some of the investments that were made in the second quarter of 2016, does Starbucks have an opportunity to continue to invest in their partners, to continue to invest in margin as a way to get outside sales? Or can you achieve outside sales levels and actually begin to get leverage on that line?"

The investments we're making in our partners both in the technology side to give them the tools to improve the way they do the work and also in them as partners and the salaries and benefits, we are certainly seeing a strengthening engagement, reduction in turnover at partner level, and we are seeing the opportunity to invest also in hours to capture more of the opportunity that presents itself. Certainly, it has helped us cope with the benefits from Mobile Order & Pay and we have seen growth at peak times across all of our markets.

Of course, Mobile Order & Pay orders are driving incrementality, particularly at our busiest stores at peak. We're seeing incremental occasions that come from the convenience itself plus throughput, efficiency and line blocking benefits that we're seeing. Though, in our busiest stores in particular, we're seeing the incrementality we hoped for. In terms of learnings, I can tell you that we have -- we have just scratched the surface in terms of our ability to both promote Mobile Order & Pay and provide trials to our customers because we're seeing great conversion upon trial. That's one of the learnings. And we've got this robust road map for additional features over the course of the rest of this year, including the ability to earn -- to use your earned My Starbucks Rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow, the ability to pay it at stores in favorite items and, of course, suggested and recommended sell-ins, which will be a great thing for improving attach.

          I'd just want to add one thing, as it relates to China specifically, having just been in China, John and I, over the last week or so, I think there's one significant difference between the young people in China and the evolution of mobile in the U.S. And that is the Chinese consumer has leapfrogged from a rotary phone to a regular phone to a cellphone and a smartphone overnight. And as a result of that, not if, but when we roll out Mobile Order & Pay and mobile payment in China, the adoption that we believe we're going to have in China is going to be more significant and quicker than it has been in the U.S. which already has stunned us in terms of how quickly the U.S. customer has embraced it. So our growth in China is not only in terms of the 500 stores per year that we're going to add over the next 5 years, it's overlaying that growth with technology that we strongly believe is going to be adopted at a quicker pace than the U.S. consumer has because of how technology is embedded in the Chinese consumer's life."

          I have 2 questions just on Mobile Ordering and digital in general.

Or do you think you have the way to amass several of them to kind of roll it out just because consumers don't want to keep updating their apps all the time to get the latest? And secondly, related to that, those who -- others who've engaged in digital platforms have seen tipping points where adoption really accelerates significantly and also you get an accelerated labor benefit. You've been able to suddenly remove certain amount of labor from the store because it's coming in, you're getting digital orders or whatever. Do you have a sense where those tipping points of both revenue and for labor are for Starbucks, if you've already reached them or when you might expect to have reached them?"

The way we approach it is we're constantly at work, adding new features, both in the U.S. and around the globe, on both our iOS and Android platform. So you saw that, just in the last week, as we not only launched the Spotify integration in the U.S., but we also added Mobile Order & Pay to Android in the U.K. and Canada, also just in the last week. So you can see how busy we are. The future enhancements to Mobile Ordering that I mentioned are going to happen when those features are ready. They're going to happen over the course of the year, we're not going to bunch them up. And so you'll see those happen on a continual basis. And it's -- really, the tipping point, I would say that we're just continuing to see acceleration of the adoption of Mobile Order & Pay. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we -- this has been happening from the beginning and we saw acceleration through the first quarter and even into January, now we're up to 6 million mobile orders per month run rate. And we anticipate expect that to continue. And I also mentioned that we're just scratching the surface in terms of awareness and trial.

So I think that tipping point is happening in some stores, and it's happening in a really meaningful way in the high-volume stores, which is great. And in terms of labor, we're not looking at it that way. We're looking at using the labor to continually serve the customers that are there, continue to build relationships with our customers and enhance the experience. So I think it's a continuous process of check and adjust; increase capacity in the store; hopefully, have more Mobile Order & Pay orders; and then grow our labor accordingly. And that's the way we're looking at it."

          We don't break out comps by country within this segment, but let me say it this way. We have over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened. In terms of day-part, I think, in addition to the technology we talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that, for the most part, without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our minds, if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great, not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been opened the longest in Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. So if you look of the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on the technology we talked about and then we know the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. So anyone on the call who is, in any way, dissuaded by our commitment or our success in China as a result of the 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric."

          That's a perfect question for me. So I think we said 3 years ago publicly that we began to envision that there would be a seismic change in consumer behavior. And that seismic change was due, in large part, to e-commerce and smartphone shopping. I think today, in the headlines you've seen just in the last 3 weeks, store closures of almost 50 Macy's stores, 150 Walmart stores, you got to ask yourself, what's going to happen to the future of many of those malls that are anchored by those big-box retailers? Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in the country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business, and we finished very strong for the quarter. So we are -- we've insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000. And in addition to what I said about China and the 150 stores that we just opened best-of-class, the stores that we've opened in the U.S. this year are also best-of-class in terms of revenue and return on investment. So we see no signs whatsoever that we are going to be hit in any way by the seismic change in consumer behavior because we invested ahead of the growth curve and we continue to invest in those things that are customer-facing, partner-facing and technology."

And so I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. Scott?"

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for",459,":  
          Yes, I'd add 2 things, one, to what Kevin just said. Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven, margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that is a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we're seeing some softening, and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance, and we're not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move up towards the low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition, and we're just getting started in growing that business with a team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is very strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter of what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little bit harder as we've discussed."

Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic. By far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card and investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business.
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1, and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day-parts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results, despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic, foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers.
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand.
Our plans to build over 500 coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods doing intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roast and ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us.
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to millennials.
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business, and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum (sic) [China Partner Family Forum]. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect of the parents of our partners have for their children and then their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all the Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba.
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through Tmall, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffeting of the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future.
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business. Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchased the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and at the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own.
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has a Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1.

I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail.
Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region, and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance.
On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over.
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks Gift Cards, once again, enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. In this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift Cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum.
This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.
Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation, such as Teavana Shaken Iced Teas and Cold Brew Coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth.
And our morning day-part saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-parts, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio.
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on Mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have and the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region.
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all day-parts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently begun to see the effects of that region's resilience and the recovery. We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by the strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segments significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores, on average, having a holiday display in December. In addition, our limited time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks Hot Cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw a strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 30.4%, driven by new product innovation in our frappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite.
Beyond the U.S., we've continued to successfully execute against plans to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building from our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.

A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own.
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world.
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January.
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars.
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customers. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand.
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program, and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.
I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take us through our Q1 financial results in detail. Scott?"
34745,311935385,920410,"Starbucks Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income incre",1849,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.
As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks-Japan-related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner and digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage and excellent management around cost of goods sold.
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner and digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016, despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By a way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect 3 acquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy. Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from 2015 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our licensed business, resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American Coffee Partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1. As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite over performance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to, again, deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full year.
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 4 -- 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of a deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA.
The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1, and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter-end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15% and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and, as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark. The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted, disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

So I think it's, number one, it's the innovation we've done in food and how that's been presented to the customer in the stores. I think that's the big part of it. Certainly, digital helps because we could target offerings to get customers to try new things. And so what we find is, once we encourage trial, that starts to lead to repeatability. So let me hand it over to Cliff to add a little more color behind what we're doing in the stores that will drive that."

And that I think has really helped them build confidence. And it's followed best practice we've had with beverage for many years, so they're very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on breakfast but now in lunch. And Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65%. And we own that format, and we consider that another way that we can grow our range.

We have over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened. In terms of day-part, I think, in addition to the technology we talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that, for the most part, without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our minds, if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great, not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been opened the longest in Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. So if you look of the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on the technology we talked about and then we know the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. So anyone on the call who is, in any way, dissuaded by our commitment or our success in China as a result of the 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric."

And in addition to what I said about China and the 150 stores that we just opened best-of-class, the stores that we've opened in the U.S. this year are also best-of-class in terms of revenue and return on investment. So we see no signs whatsoever that we are going to be hit in any way by the seismic change in consumer behavior because we invested ahead of the growth curve and we continue to invest in those things that are customer-facing, partner-facing and technology."

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven, margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that is a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we're seeing some softening, and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance, and we're not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move up towards the low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition, and we're just getting started in growing that business with a team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is very strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter of what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little bit harder as we've discussed."

Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic. By far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card and investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business.
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1, and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day-parts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results, despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic, foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers.
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand.
Our plans to build over 500 coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods doing intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roast and ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us.
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to millennials.
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business, and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum (sic) [China Partner Family Forum]. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect of the parents of our partners have for their children and then their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all the Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba.
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through Tmall, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffeting of the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future.
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business. Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchased the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and at the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own.
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has a Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over.
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks Gift Cards, once again, enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. In this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift Cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum.
This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.
Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation, such as Teavana Shaken Iced Teas and Cold Brew Coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth.
And our morning day-part saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-parts, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio.
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on Mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have and the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region.
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all day-parts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently begun to see the effects of that region's resilience and the recovery. We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by the strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segments significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores, on average, having a holiday display in December. In addition, our limited time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks Hot Cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw a strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 13.4% [ph], driven by new product innovation in our frappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite.
Beyond the U.S., we've continued to successfully execute against plans to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building from our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin. Kevin?"

A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own.
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world.
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January.
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars.
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customers. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand.
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program, and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.
I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take us through our Q1 financial results in detail. Scott?"
34745,311935385,925534,"Starbucks Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income incre",1847,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.
As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks-Japan-related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner and digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage and excellent management around cost of goods sold.
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner and digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016, despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect preacquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy. Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from 2015 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our licensed business, resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American Coffee Partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1. As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite over performance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to, again, deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full year.
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 4 -- 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of a deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA.
The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1, and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter-end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15% and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and, as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark. The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted, disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on breakfast but now in lunch. And Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65%.

In terms of learnings, I can tell you that we have -- we have just scratched the surface in terms of our ability to both promote Mobile Order & Pay and provide trials to our customers because we're seeing great conversion upon trial. That's one of the learnings. And we've got this robust road map for additional features over the course of the rest of this year, including the ability to earn -- to use your earned My Starbucks Rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow, the ability to pay it at stores in favorite items and, of course, suggested and recommended sell-ins, which will be a great thing for improving attach.

So our growth in China is not only in terms of the 500 stores per year that we're going to add over the next 5 years, it's overlaying that growth with technology that we strongly believe is going to be adopted at a quicker pace than the U.S. consumer has because of how technology is embedded in the Chinese consumer's life."

We have over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened. In terms of day-part, I think, in addition to the technology we talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that, for the most part, without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our minds, if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great, not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been opened the longest in Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. So if you look of the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on the technology we talked about and then we know the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. So anyone on the call who is, in any way, dissuaded by our commitment or our success in China as a result of the 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric."

Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in the country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business, and we finished very strong for the quarter. So we are -- we've insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000.

Just trying to get a feel for whether it's just kind of a broader macro issue or whether there's anything you think is going on just within the Starbucks numbers? And the separately, Scott, I was just wondering if you can just give an update on just the balance of the dividend versus the share repo and kind of, I guess, the lift on leverage. I know you talked a lot about returning incremental cash with the share repurchase and, obviously, the dividends. Just any updated thoughts on that would be great."

And so I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. Scott?"

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few",459,"Yes, I'd add 2 things, one, to what Kevin just said. Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven, margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that is a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we're seeing some softening, and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance, and we're not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move up towards the low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition, and we're just getting started in growing that business with a team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is very strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter of what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little bit harder as we've discussed."

Starbucks' stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance, highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic. By far, the strongest holiday in our history, and record revenues and record operating income from our Channel Development segment, underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive flywheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile, loyalty, card and investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business. 
In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and a 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share, despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1, and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone than we did in our very strong Q1 last year.
Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all dayparts at around the world than ever before. And we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial and operating results, despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite challenging macroeconomic, foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continued to negatively impact many other national and global retailers. 
Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks' core and are propelling our business forward. In the Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category, creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated, highly differentiated, locally relevant premium coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience for our customers everywhere. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle, at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. 
Our plans to build over 500 coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods to an intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom beverage. Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana superpremium loose-leaf and packaged teas. And Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand, while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity of origin that only Starbucks can deliver.
Starbucks' Channel Development segment is literally firing on all cylinders, delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and lead market share in both premium roast and ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through Channel Development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.  No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us. 
By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive, integrated, digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future. Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, particularly to Millennials. 
Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores; over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we report today; breakthrough mobile and digital technologies; and over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business, and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week, at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.
But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep authentic connection we have with our customers and our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this firsthand perhaps like never before on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum (sic) [China Partner Family Forum]. It was an extraordinary, emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect of the parents of our partners have for their children and then their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks Experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all the Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba. 
In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the first -- very first time through Tmall, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards membership, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.
As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO who has traveled to China repeatedly over the last 10 years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffeting of the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development. Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer-driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.
We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China. Because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I'm equally convinced that when we fully roll out our digital mobile card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.
Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. 
And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business. Over the last 5 years, we have invested and built a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform. And today, Starbucks is the leading brand with a leading share on that platform.
Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks-branded coffee to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchased the Keurig brewers only after Starbucks Coffee became available on the platform and at the market, that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own. 
Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has a Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today. And never before have the opportunities lie ahead as -- or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners, to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact, and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1.

I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter, before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance Channel Development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail. 
Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region, and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance. 
On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, Channel Development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over. 
This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with 5 specialized Merry Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.
Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend reserve coffee quickly sold out, and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.
Starbucks Gift Cards, once again, enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, 1 in 6 American adults received a Starbucks Gift Card, up from 1 in 7 last year and 1 in 8 the year before. In this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift Cards led to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum. 
This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments. Our fast-growing American segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months.  
Core offerings in our blended, espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovation, such as Teavana Shaken Iced Teas and Cold Brew Coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S. Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth. 
And our morning daypart saw its strongest growth in 5 years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all day-part, with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.
Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well, with first-year average volumes exceeding 1.4 million, while delivering record profitability and return on investment.
Moving on to CAP. The change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores. And we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.
One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform, where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio. 
As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on Mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities. And we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year '19.  As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have in the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region. 
Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all dayparts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comps base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth, representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance, giving -- given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following the horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong, and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently begun to see the effects of that region's resilience and the recovery. We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead.
EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.
In addition to strong retail performance, our Channel Development segment delivered record results in the quarter. And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?"

Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1, while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million. And we were up 16% over Q1 last year, following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal '15. This was driven by the strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-to-drink coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.
In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segments significantly outpaced the overall category, punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned that aisles red, with nearly 2 out of 3 grocery stores, on average, having a holiday display in December. In addition, our limited time Holiday Blend Coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest-selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than 5x total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the #2 player in all coffee. In addition, Starbucks was the fastest growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth.
Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the #1 K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the #1 brand for the full calendar year, while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.  Recently launched Starbucks Hot Cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter.
Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1, with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%. We saw a strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts, such as Delta Air Lines and the Compass Group.
Turning to ready-to-drink coffee. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in 110 basis points share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 13.4% [ph], driven by new product innovation in our frappuccino and Doubleshot platforms and through expanded distribution. For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the #8 brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as Powerade and Sprite. 
Beyond the U.S., we've continued to successfully execute against plans to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA, with momentum building from our most recent launches in 6 Middle East markets.
Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brand and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin. Kevin?"

A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform. And the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own. 
We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world. 
Customer engagement is also growing. In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps, with December accelerating to 22%, and we're seeing further acceleration in the month of January. 
Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our Mobile Order & Pay capability in the month of December. And those customers averaged approximately 5 mobile orders in a month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of Mobile Order & Pay is growing, and we are now processing over 6 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month. In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, Mobile Order & Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions.  And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan, and we are expanding the digital agenda across 4 key pillars. 
The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery.
Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customers. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.
Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners.
And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand. 
The Starbucks digital flywheel is driven by our loyalty program, and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last 2 years. In 2016, we will be enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program, and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities in investments combined with a focus on excellence in execution is powering our results.
I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take us through our Q1 financial results in detail. Scott?"
34745,311935385,950587,"Starbucks Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015.

We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. 
As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015. Noteworthy is that Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Excluding certain Starbucks-Japan-related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9%. And non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record $0.46. For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner in digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact, and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.
I'll now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas, our largest business segment, has never been stronger, driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record-high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1%, also a Q1 record, driven primarily by sales leverage and excellent management around cost of goods sold. 
The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner in digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.  The increase in partner and digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change, as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that included 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016, despite the significant investments we continue to make.
Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4% due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.
By a way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect preacquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy. Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year 1 performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead. Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared from 2015 levels.  Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.
EMEA's operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sale of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our licensed business, resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holiday. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top line growth, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our licensed stores, which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits.
While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectations of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.
Channel Development operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7%. And segment operating income reached a quarterly record of $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American Coffee Partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of Channel Development's margin improvement in Q1. As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in Channel Development over the prior year.
As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.
Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter: GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.
For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full year EPS guidance despite over performance in Q1.
There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter, despite the headwinds I just mentioned.
Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to, again, deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the year. 
We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us.
And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 4 -- 5-point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way. Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of a deep connection our partners build over time with their customers. And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to a Mobile Order & Pay where expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.
We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017, and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. 
The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, we increased total cash return to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1, and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter-end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.
Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15% and our 12th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and, as appropriate, selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark. The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted, disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.
Finally, what is particularly exciting is that despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place, together with our proven ability to execute, gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and the size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

So I think it's, number one, it's the innovation we've done in food and how that's been presented to the customer in the stores. I think that's the big part of it.

One of the changes we made in Q2 last year was we introduced a food benefit with partners in the U.S. who are working on shift, they could have free food. And that I think has really helped them build confidence. And it's followed best practice we've had with beverage for many years, so they're very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range, basing it on breakfast but now in lunch. And Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65%. And we own that format, and we consider that another way that we can grow our range. So it's about having a confidence around food, having an authority around food and working on quality, variety, availability and on selling skills of our partners. So all in all, it's going well, and we have a lot more runway to continue to build food."

Though, in our busiest stores in particular, we're seeing the incrementality we hoped for. In terms of learnings, I can tell you that we have -- we have just scratched the surface in terms of our ability to both promote Mobile Order & Pay and provide trials to our customers because we're seeing great conversion upon trial. That's one of the learnings. And we've got this robust road map for additional features over the course of the rest of this year, including the ability to earn -- to use your earned My Starbucks Rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow, the ability to pay it at stores in favorite items and, of course, suggested and recommended sell-ins, which will be a great thing for improving attach. So all those things are as a result of the learnings, and you'll see us roll those out over the course of this year."

And as a result of that, not if, but when we roll out Mobile Order & Pay and mobile payment in China, the adoption that we believe we're going to have in China is going to be more significant and quicker than it has been in the U.S. which already has stunned us in terms of how quickly the U.S. customer has embraced it. So our growth in China is not only in terms of the 500 stores per year that we're going to add over the next 5 years, it's overlaying that growth with technology that we strongly believe is going to be adopted at a quicker pace than the U.S. consumer has because of how technology is embedded in the Chinese consumer's life."

Or do you think you have to wait to amass several of them to kind of roll it out just because consumers don't want to keep updating their apps all the time to get the latest? And secondly, related to that, those who -- others who've engaged in digital platforms have seen tipping points where adoption really accelerates significantly and also you get an accelerated labor benefit. You've been able to suddenly remove certain amount of labor from the store because it's coming in, you're getting digital orders or whatever.

And it's -- really, the tipping point, I would say that we're just continuing to see acceleration of the adoption of Mobile Order & Pay. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we -- this has been happening from the beginning and we saw acceleration through the first quarter and even into January, now we're up to 6 million mobile orders per month run rate.

We're looking at using the labor to continually serve the customers that are there, continue to build relationships with our customers and enhance the experience.

We have over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we're enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We've opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history, and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened. In terms of daypart, I think, in addition to the technology we talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we're sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China. And we're doing that, for the most part, without truly establishing a morning ritual. And there's no doubt in our minds, if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we're seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great, not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been opened the longest in Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing. So if you look at the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive, and you lay on the technology we talked about and then we know the morning ritual's going to come, we are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. So anyone on the call who is, in any way, dissuaded by our commitment or our success in China as a result of the 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric."

Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in the country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business, and we finished very strong for the quarter. So we are -- we've insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000.

Just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP, this year and over the long term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA, for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven, margin was essentially 0. And we're guiding to 15% this year, which is over 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that is a market with significant profitability growth. So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us. And it looked like we were right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we're seeing some softening, and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance, and we're not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA. And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move up towards the low to mid-20s over 5 years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We'll have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition, and we're just getting started in growing that business with a team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter, and the outlook for the future is very strong. As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff, that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter of what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters, that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little bit harder as we've discussed."

I take my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,0",1694,"Thank you, Durga, and welcome, everyone. I take my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,000 store global retail operation again drove record financial and operating performance, including record revenues, record profits, a 7% increase in comp store sales in the U.S., a 6% increase in comp store sales globally, our 25th consecutive quarter of comp store growth at/or above 5% and a stunning increase of 5% in transaction growth and 18% in revenue growth in China. And we remain on plan to end fiscal 2016 with approximately 25,000 stores globally. 
Our recent classes of new and remodeled retail stores continue to defy established consumer trends away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and deliver record-breaking unit sales, unit economics and return on investment, very strong performance metrics that underscore the increasing power and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. 
In light of 2 very favorable recent developments, I'd like to take a few moments to frame for you the enormity of the near-end and long-term global single-serve opportunity that lies ahead for Starbucks. As many of you know, over the last 5 years, Starbucks has built a powerful sustainable, premium single-serve business operating on the Keurig K-Cup. And today, Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of both premium single-serve and premium roasting ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform. For 2016, we will sell approximately 1.5 billion Starbucks K-Cups, up almost 20% over last year and representing multiples of K-Cup category growth overall. 
Last month, we extended our relationship with Keurig on highly favorable terms that provide us with improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into office and other complementary highly profitable channels of distribution. But Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America nor do they end with K-Cup. And now we have capability and a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity. Because while Keurig has the dominant share of single-serve brews in North America, it has virtually no share or relevant brewer park anywhere beyond North America. 
Outside of North America is Nestle's Espresso unit that has a leading share of premium single-serve with a rapidly growing installed base of what we estimate to be over 25 million largely espresso-based brews at homes around the world. And espresso also has a strong presence in global away from home and hospitality channels utilizing the same capsule design it uses for at home. So here's the opportunity and it's big. For years, customers have been asking us to produce Starbucks-branded espresso-compatible capsules so they could enjoy Starbucks' quality and espresso varietals through their espresso machines, just as they do through their K-Cup brews North America. While we could not satisfy that demand because we had not yet cracked the code on roasting, grinding and packing Starbucks Coffee in order to deliver Starbucks' quality in a cup through a Starbucks design and espresso-compatible capsule. But now, we have. And as we announced at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting last month, starting this fall, we will begin leveraging our retail, CPG, e-commerce, digital and loyalty assets in order to market Starbucks' espresso varietals directly to an espresso's install customer base. We're starting with Europe, an espresso's largest market, and where in some countries, single-serve represents over 40% of all coffee consumed and 50% of our best Starbucks customers own an espresso machine at home. And in the future, we will begin selling Starbucks-branded espresso-compatible pods in additional Starbucks retail markets around the world. 
Improved economics and increased flexibility with Keurig in North America will combine with the new global opportunity presented by Starbucks espresso-compatibles to enable us to substantially increase the size and profitability of our single-serve business overall and to add significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. 
We also have big long-term plans for single-serve across CAP and China. As the only truly global premium coffee brand, particularly in China, we are duly positioned to leverage our deep connection to our customers and our unique retail store footprint could be in the forefront of single-serve in all CAP markets as the morning and at-home coffee ritual evolves. 
Let me turn to China. Starbucks has committed to China, and we now over 2,000 stores in 100 cities in China and are adding over 10 new stores every week. Our business in China remains very strong, and I personally have no doubt that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that it's planned to double 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in the middle class in China approaching 600 million people, almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is achievable. We are building our business in China through the lens and with the learnings of the success of our business in the U.S. We're building trust in the Starbucks brand and deep authentic connections between our customers and our partners. We're continuing to look to deliver an elevated in-store experience for our customers. We're increasingly established Starbucks as the third place between home and work, and we're giving back to the communities we serve, all of which are enabling us to strengthen the equity of the Starbucks brand and develop and expand our retail, license and CPG businesses and partnerships. 
Our partnership with Tingyi that will provide us with over 1 million points of ready-to-drink frappuccino distribution in China beginning later this quarter is just one notable example, and there'll be many that will follow. Today, not only are we building a brand in a great retail store business in China, but we are building a unique retailing capability that separates us from all other retailers and consumer brands, and that we will leverage to continue growing our China business long into the future.
And on June 16, we will open in China what will in all probability become Starbucks' highest-grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the #1 tourist attraction in Asia. Our new Shanghai Disneyland story will showcase the Starbucks Experience in all its glory and our premium coffee position and once again, underscore the power and the relevance of the Starbucks brand in China and in CAP overall. We're honored that the Disney Company chose Starbucks to sell prominently greeted guests at the entrance of the new park. I am more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and I am equally convinced that as we fully roll out our new partnerships with the leading digital companies and brands in China and leverage our unique digital, mobile, card, gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China later this year and ultimately, across CAP overall, we will perform an even higher level of success and profitability in the future than we do today. Starbucks continues to redefine the customer-facing mobile and retail experience of the future. Kevin will be taking you through how we are combining proprietary technologies, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create and leverage a dynamic integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to turn our business and propel it forward, including providing additional details around our Stars Everywhere initiative, the unique and highly opportunistic partnership we recently announced with JPMorgan Chase and visa and our breakthrough initiatives around personalization that are enabling us to deliver highly targeted and highly profitable 1-to-1 marketing programs for our customers wherever they may be. 
I'm particularly proud to report that we grew our MSR loyalty program 8% by adding approximately 1 million new members in Q2 alone and that we now have over 12 million active My Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. And the MSR program changes that took effect on April 12 will for the first time reward both customer frequency and overall spend, resulting in increased rewards for our best customers at the same time as it enhances in-store efficiency, speed of service and our customer experience overall. 
I'd like to speak for a moment about the excitement we have about the Roastery in the context of Starbucks' overall brand architecture. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight our customers and perform well ahead on original expectations. Based on experience to date, our current view is that we will ultimately open between 7 and 10 full-scale Roastery's around the world in key global cities. Our second Roastery will be opening in New York's meatpacking district on the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, next to the heavily trafficked Chelsea market, directly across The Street from Google's headquarters and adjacent to Apple's downtown store in 2018. And soon, we'll be announcing details of our third Roastery, which will be in CAP. 
In addition to providing an immersive customer experience with the Roastery into the discipline and the opportunity of segmentation, we had been building a new premium brand, Starbucks Reserve. Starbucks Reserve, our ultra premium micro-lot single varietal coffees that are being sold at premium prices through select Starbucks stores around the world, creating both increased profitability and further separation from our competitors. And we will continue to open coffee forward, Starbucks stores with elevated reserve beverage and whole grain products like those in Brooklyn, Chelsea, London and across Asia. Now following the success and the learnings from these stores, we will be opening a new class of Reserve stores beginning at fiscal 2017. We believe we have significant runway to grow and develop our Starbucks Reserve brand on a global basis. 
Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrates the continued success of our commitments to delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers and world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. With humility, our performance in Q2 is particularly gratifying in that it was achieved in the face of very challenging consumer geopolitical and economic environments. 
And with that, from South Africa, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I will add additional color on our performance and provide further evidence that our strategies for growth are working. And I'll again demonstrate how we are being deliberate and focused in connection with the investments we are making for our future. 
Let's start with the America segment. We now have over 15,000 stores throughout the Americas business, comprised of nearly 9,000 company-operated and over 6,000 licensed stores. Our Americas business continued its track record of delivering consistent profitable growth with revenue up 10% over last year and record operating margins. America's comp sales included a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in ticket, rounding to a 7% increase in comp sales. Our store strategy is enabling introduction of new store format faster and more efficient drive thrus, express stores and beautiful renovation that provide our customers not only with increased convenience, but a more inviting and comfortable third place environment. This approach is enabling record-setting unit volume in our new stores. The morning daypart, once again our fastest-growing daypart, grew 13% year-on-year, driven by Mobile Order & Pay, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches. Flat White and cold brew both continued to gain traction and customer acceptance and dry food attach. In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers. Our tea business in particular had its strongest quarter in over a year, up 17% year-on-year and contributing 1 point of comp, fueled by an accelerated sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages and Starbucks retail stores. Creating new customer occasions and driving increased attach are key priorities for our food programs. And we made great progress with our food business this quarter, growing revenue 16% year-on-year and contributing over 2 points to our comp with every daypart contributing to this increase. Breakfast sandwiches continue to be a strong driver of the business, delivering nearly 30% revenue growth and driving both traffic and increased attach in the morning daypart. Our innovative new lineup of lunch offerings delivered an 18% year-on-year increase in food revenue during the lunch daypart, and we continue to test and learn as we shape our evening's program. For the first time ever, food represented more than 20% of revenue in the U.S. Our America segment had an outstanding Q2. 
Let's now move on to the CAP segment. The China/Asia Pacific business delivered another solid quarter, with revenues increasing 14% and operating income up 15% over Q2 a year ago. Noteworthy is that this is the first full quarter in which our 1,100 store Japan retail business was fully included in both our CAP comp and revenue base, resulting in CAP comp growth of 2% of traffic and 2% in ticket, rounding to 3% overall. We now operate over 5,900 stores in CAP, including over 2,000 in Mainland China in more than 100 cities. Despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China grew revenue 18% and transactions 5% in the quarter. We saw particularly strong transaction growth in the larger cities, and our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, once again demonstrating the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the China market. As Howard mentioned, we will leverage our loyalty and digital flywheel in China with the rollout of certain features this year and full digital capabilities over time. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. While Starbucks is not immune to cyclical changes in the Chinese economy, our long-term outlook remains strong, and we're committed to increasing our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of 2019 -- fiscal '19. 
Let's move on to EMEA. We continue to build our 2,500 store EMEA business by increasing our store count, entering new countries, including Luxembourg in Q2, with South Africa, Slovakia and Andorra opening this quarter, and introducing new food and beverage offerings. Overall, we added 47 net new stores in EMEA, all in conjunction with licensee partners and high-traffic venues such as train stations, airports, supermarkets and through geographic licensees such as Al in the Middle East. We continue to see strong affinity with the brand, as evidenced by the opening of our first Starbucks store in burg, France, where hundreds of energized customers lined up to be among the first in the market to enjoy the Starbucks Experience. Company-operated EMEA stores delivered a 1% comp sales increase in the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. With 72% of EMEA stores now licensed for franchise, total system comps are becoming increasingly relevant. Adjusting for continued mix shift from company-owned to license and foreign exchange headwinds, which together impacted revenue growth by 11 points, EMEA on an adjusted revenue basis will deliver growth of 7% and system comp growth of 4% as well as increasing operating income in the quarter. This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region and reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in EMEA. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see a continued mix shift to license stores in EMEA where yesterday, we announced entry into an agreement to license all 144 of our stores in Germany to an existing licensee partner, AmRest Holdings. This strategy supports our focus on store growth and expanded operating income. 
Let's move on to Channel Development. Our Channel Development segment plays a key role in elevating the Starbucks brand outside of our retail stores. Channel Development has become our second most profitable business segment and once again, delivered record revenue and record operating income, growing 8% and 17%, respectively. Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform and premium roast and ground. In this quarter, we expanded our market share position in both of those categories. Our new partnership agreement with Keurig provides us with both improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into complementary profitable challenge of distribution such as hospitality, college, university and office where we consistently grow our business at 2 to 3x the industry rate. 
Our success in single-serve in the U.S. provides the foundation for a larger aspiration around the single-serve opportunity globally. Later this year, we will introduce the espresso-compatible Starbucks capsules in Europe as one step toward building a business that 1 day may rival the size and profitability of our single-serve business in North America. 
Our ready-to-drink business in North America continue to see very strong performance in the quarter, driven by new beverage innovation, including iced black coffee, refreshers with coconut water and product line extensions for frappuccino and Doubleshot energy drinks. Outside of North America, we continue to make meaningful progress, building our global CPG footprint. Our partnership with Tingyi's Ontrack to launch this summer where we will move to a national presence with distribution in nearly every major city in China. 
Through our new agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we are enabling distribution in the Latin American market in the second half of this year. Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well and plays a key role in elevating our brand globally. 
Let's now move on to the progress we are making on our loyalty and digital initiatives. Loyalty remains a cornerstone of our digital flywheel. And in late February, we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards program that benefits our most loyal customers by leveling the playing field in rewarding both transaction frequency and total spend. With these changes, we also laid the foundation for customers to earn Stars Everywhere, which accelerates the pace at which customers earn rewards redeemable only at Starbucks. 
Rewards membership has accelerated. Just last week alone, we added more than 280,000 new rewards members. Engaging with these new rewards members will enable us to accelerate growth of our active Starbucks Rewards customer base. Besides bringing us new customers, the program also addresses an operational challenge where under the old program, customers would ask for to bring out each item individually in order to get multiple stars, a time-consuming process that created additional work for our baristas, slowed service and lengthened lines. By completely eliminating any incentive to order split, we will improve in-store operations and efficiency and increase line speed. I want to take a moment to underscore that the changes in our rewards program will be accretive to comps over time. As we mentioned during our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, as a result of the changes to the program, we anticipate a shift of about 1 point of comp between transaction and ticket. Also, we may see some noise in Q3 comps, as customers react to the new changes of the program. Scott will speak to this further in a moment. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 12 million active Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S. with total program spend growth of 22% year-on-year. We've seen additional growth in active reward customers since the launch of the new program last week. Our new mobile app continues to be very well received where today over 80% [ph] of our iPhone customers and 70% [ph] of our Android customers have already upgraded to the new version of the Starbucks mobile app that released just last week. And we now have almost 19 million users of our mobile app in the U.S. alone. Mobile payment represented 24% of total U.S. tender in Q2, and Mobile Order & Pay continues to be increasingly embraced by our customers. It added incrementality, especially at peak. Mobile Order & Pay transactions represented approximately 4% of total transactions in the quarter, which was a 40% increase sequentially. But we are just beginning to see the full benefit of Mobile Order & Pay beyond the speed and convenience that affords to both our customers and partners. Consider this. Though still in its infancy, in 300 of our busiest urban stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 10% of transactions. And in those same stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay represents nearly 20% of transactions. In Portland, where we first introduced Mobile Order & Pay in December of 2014, transact Mobile Order & Pay transaction volume in March was up approximately 150% from March of last year. The new Starbucks Rewards program and Starbucks mobile app have positioned us for 2 very exciting initiatives that you will see unfold later this year. The first initiative through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Visa, is truly a first of its kind. A Starbucks general-purpose prepaid Visa card that will enable Starbucks Reward customers to earn Stars everywhere Visa is expected. That's 40 million merchants worldwide. And where all stars earned can only be redeemed at Starbucks. We think this is a big win for our customers. In the U.S., total annual spending on credit and debit cards totaled around $9 trillion annually, roughly half on credit and half on debit cards. While the majority of credit cards used today offer rewards or points, typically with an annual fee, there is no meaningful debit-based rewards card program out there. That means that on more than $4 trillion of annual consumer spending, virtually no one using a debit card is getting rewards. Not anymore. This new Starbucks general-purpose prepaid reloadable debit card is unique. And not only is it a win for customers. It is also a win for Starbucks by strengthening our customer engagement and providing us with a direct financial reward for every customer we sign up and leading to attracted interchange rates. Stay tuned for more details about the card and sign-up information later this year. 
The second exciting initiative evolves around the work we are doing to enable real-time personalization. Let me frame this for you. A major contributor to the success of our rewards program has been the targeted offers that we have made to customers via e-mail. Since launching our targeted offer program in 2013, we have been providing ways for customers to earn extra Stars for purchasing certain items or making additional business to our stores. However, existing technology constrained our ability to laser-target, respond in a moment and vary our digital content based on what we know to be an individual customer's preferences and behaviors. All that is changing as we begin to introduce true real-time personalization across our entire digital ecosystem. Following the successful implementation of the first wave of this new technology, we can now send significantly improved targeted communications to individual customers based on what we know about their specific tastes and interests, enabling us to become even more relevant to them. Over time, we will expand this capability to a more robust mobile app-centric model that enables us, at the very moment of customer orders, to provide relevant suggestions and recommendations and when appropriate, incentivize offers to delight our customers. As you can see, we are managing a significant number of accretive changes related to loyalty, digital and Stars Everywhere. 
A few words on the success of the investments we continue to make in our partners and the work we're doing to improve the partner experience overall. Creating an enhanced Starbucks Experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to the Starbucks Experience. Last year, we began rolling out a number of significant investments in support of our in-store partners that included increased barista and ship supervisor pay raise, additional performance-based recognition, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit as well as enhancements to our college achievement program. These investments are paying off. We continue to see increases in partner retention, which is enabling better customer connections, and customer connection is a key driver of our record Q2 performance. As you can see, our results provide powerful evidence that our strategies and focused investments are paying off today and setting us up for continued growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?"
34745,311935472,961403,"Starbucks Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating inc",1709,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating income, operating margin and EPS. Noteworthy is that our revenues in Q2 were the highest of any nonholiday quarter in our history. EPS, both GAAP and non-GAAP, increased 18% to $0.39 in Q2, the top end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% over Q2 last year at $887 million, while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.6%. Margin improvement in Q2 was driven by sales leverage that more than offset the impact of ongoing investments, particularly in our partners and our digital platforms. It's important to note this quarter that our consolidated operating margin also reflects dilution from a multiyear employment tax auditor tool. More specifically, our 30 basis point increase in operating margin would have been 40 basis points higher or 70 basis points in total, and our operating income growth would have been 240 basis points higher than the reported 11% or 14% with rounding. The impacted SG&A-related accrual was largely offset below the operating income line in Q2 income taxes and is expected to be entirely offset in federal income tax expense by fiscal year-end, resulting in no impact to earnings for full year 2016. You may recall that our Investor Day in December 2014, we discussed the importance of reversing the negative leverage we were seeing on cost of goods sold in G&A. I'm pleased to report that the plan we put in place to do so are working. And that on top of the significant progress we made on that front last year, so far this year, we are seeing an additional 60 basis points of COGS and occupancy leverage, driven mostly by COGS and 40 basis points in G&A leverage. 
Return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, once again reflecting excellent returns on our core businesses and demonstrating the outsized return we are generating on many of our significant newer investments. And our reported record Q2 results became even more noteworthy in light of the fact that foreign currency translation shaved a full point off revenue and 2 points off operating income growth in the quarter. 
I'll now take you through how each of our major operating segments performed in Q2. In Q2, our America's segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points over Q2 last year to 23.5%, primarily driven by sales leverage and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by ongoing store partner and digital platform investments that together adversely impacted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter. Noteworthy again, as we mentioned last quarter, is that we continue to see essentially no net cannibalization of existing stores as we expand our store footprint in the Americas and leverage our full portfolio of new and existing store formats. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the Americas segment to deliver moderate margin expansion over prior year. 
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. In Q2, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 15% over last year to a Q2 record $129 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of increased compensation and benefit cost and store operating expenses. Excluding the 90 basis point impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter. Profitability of our Japan and China store portfolio continues to increase with our profitability of our store up nicely from the previous age class. And as Kevin mentioned, returns on our new stores in these 2 important markets are among the highest Starbucks is generating anywhere in the world. For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect CAP revenue growth to be within our previously stated mid-teens target range, and CAP margins are now expected to be roughly flat compared to 2015 levels. We also still expect CAP comps for the year to be in the mid-single digits despite falling just below that threshold for the current quarter, somewhat impacted by the addition of our Japan business into the CAP comp calculation. Japan is the largest component of the CAP comp base with a weighting of just over 50% of the total.
Turning to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 10 basis points in Q2 relative to last year to 10.3%, largely due to certain gains in the prior year related to the sale of assets as we shifted more stores from company-operated to our license model. Excluding these gains and the impact of FX headwinds, EMEA's operating margin expanded slightly in Q2. As Kevin mentioned, our license stores in EMEA showed strong comps and profitability growth in Q2, and income from licensees now represents roughly 60% of the total operating income we generate from EMEA. Despite challenging macroeconomic geopolitical and consumer environments that persist across the EMEA region, we remain confident that EMEA's operating margins will approach 15% in fiscal 2016, once again up nicely over the prior year.
Our Channel Development segment had another very strong quarter in Q2. Operating margin increased 300 basis points in the quarter to 39.5%, and operating income reached a new quarterly record of $182 million, up 17% over last year, driven primarily by cost of sales leverage, favorable coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. For the full fiscal year, we expect Channel Development to increase revenues by approximately 10% year-over-year with the back half of the year growing in the high single digits following the 12% growth rate we saw in the first 6 months. Channel Development's record-breaking Q1 performance, very strong Q2 results and positive outlook for the balance of the year has us confident that the segment will post moderate margin expansion in fiscal 2016 over last year. 
Given the momentum we are seeing in the business, we are also expecting strong operating leverage over the next 2 quarters. 
Given the excellent performance across the company year-to-date, we are moving the bottom end of our fiscal year 2016 EPS range up slightly from our previous guidance while retaining the top end. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the 53rd week, which by our rough estimate, adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. For Q3, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.49. For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 1 to 2 points and operating income growth by 2 to 3 points. We continue to expect to grow revenues by 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to the full fiscal year figure. 
And we remain confident in our ability to deliver
Comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year 2016. But as Kevin indicated, there exists a potential for some bumpiness in Q3 as a result of the Starbucks Rewards program changes that took effect earlier this month. And as we mentioned on our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, going forward, we expect to see a point or so of movement between traffic and ticket within comp in each of the next 4 quarters as our customers adapt to the changes. Noteworthy is that given the significant value and benefits conferred on our customers in the new program, we fully expect the changes to be accretive to each of comps, revenue and profitability over time. Investment in our partner and digital initiatives globally will total between $275 million and $300 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015, and the benefits and the returns we are realizing from these investments are becoming increasingly apparent. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities with 2016 cost companies fully priced, we expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We will continue to take careful advantage of lower coffee prices while ensuring that we source only the highest-quality coffee and provide fair economics to coffee growers around the globe. We expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 34%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in Q2 alone, the highest amount in any single quarter in our 24-year history as a publicly traded company, with share repurchases in the quarter nearly equal to buyback activity in all of 2015. And as we announced today, our Board of Directors recently increased our share buyback authority by an additional 100 million shares. 
As I mentioned at the outset, Q2 was another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial, operating and profit performance for Starbucks. And once again, the credit goes to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers every day. The tremendous momentum we have created over the first half of fiscal 2016 ideally positions us to benefit from the investments we are making in our partners, in our stores and in groundbreaking innovations and to continue delivering world-class returns to our shareholders. And we will do so despite today's challenging global economic and geopolitical landscape.

What I would say, John, is we expect to continue to make those partner in digital investments as we move through time. We know that they're driving comps. We've talked before about the tie between the changes we made about a year ago and pay for our U.S. store partners and the increase in comps that started at the same time. And in fact, what we see is at the stores that have the lowest turnover, they have the highest comps. And we've seen turnover ticked down since we made those changes. So with all tied together, it's highly accretive and highly profitable. So we'll continue to make those investments. And as we go into each year, we'll talk a little bit about the size of those investments, the impact on leverage. But there are other places in the P&L that we can go to continue to grow EPS at 15% to 20%, which is our long-term range. G&A and COGS just being 2 of them. And then nice job driving productivity on in the stores, and Mobile Order & Pay has been a key aspect of that to help us with throughput at peak. And as Kevin said, peak was once again our fastest-growing daypart in this quarter. Last quarter was our fastest-growing daypart in over 5 years. And as you know, last quarter is the first quarter we had Mobile Order & Pay fully rolled out. And what we're seeing based upon the numbers that Kevin showed is that those busiest stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay is driving significant productivity and throughput. So those are all places elsewhere in the P&L we can go to fund the investments we need to drive growth."

First off, obviously, from CAP perspective, the composition of comp has changed dramatically over the past year with the weighting of Japan coming in. If you go back a year ago, sequentially, Japan was not included in the comp base at all in '15. It was only partially included in Q1. And now we have it fully included in Q2. When you look at the total comp growth for the region, we came in at a rounding basis of 3%, 2% of that was transactions and 2% was ticket. But more importantly, when you go into China and you dig underneath China, we delivered a 5% transaction growth rate across the country. And when you dig in deeper into that in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we have over 65% of our stores, we outpaced that 5% growth transaction growth rate significantly. So for us, we have great optimism around the opportunity that exists for us in China as well as in Japan. We continue to see very strong new store performance. As Scott highlighted in both China and Japan with record revenues and record sales results and significant return on investment. So for us, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists not only in China, but then also across the entire segment."

Let me take the first part of the question, then I'll turn the second piece over to Scott.

We are gaining share across all categories that we operate in, whether it's the roast and ground category, premium coffee or K-Cups. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of share growth in the Channel Development business across all categories. And in the quarter, we grew 5x the category average and our shares increased over 100 basis points. Roast and ground we have now have a 25.3% share growth. In K-Cups, share now is it sits at 16.3%. And when you look at the success that we're having in channels, a couple things are driving at. First is the execution that we're seeing in the stores and the merchandising that we're doing and the fact that we're winning down the aisle. It's the fact that we're increasing our points of distribution. We've seen significant success with the larger packs size that we've introduced. And clearly, that's been driving our share gains across our all major categories. In addition, we've taken the My Starbucks Rewards program and introduced that down the aisle as well. wherein the quarter we saw an 18% increase in the number of codes that were redeemed. And to date, we have over 20 million codes by over 2 million MSR customers in the CPG segment. So for us, we're very encouraged by the results of that we're seeing in the category and in the segment, and we're very bullish on continuing to deliver that double-digit growth for the entire year as we look to finish out the year strong."

First of all, as we mentioned in the remarks earlier, our overall average number of transactions Mobile Order & Pay is 4% across all stores, all dayparts, all store types in the U.S. But that's just the beginning of the store Order & Pay. First of all, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks over 10% of all orders that are busy as 300 [ph] stores are mobile orders in if you know that working mobile orders comprise 7% of all orders busiest 1,200 stores. So when you really look at our busiest stores, global Order & Pay is very important. And drilling into that further, when you look at the busiest peak for those 300 busiest stores for example, mobile orders are already approaching 20% of transactions at those peak hours. So you're really seeing Mobile Order & Pay benefiting all customers. It's benefiting overall store performance in all the stores because of the incrementality and throughput unlocked. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay is allowing customers convenience so they can have it incremental visited, incremental occasion they normally have time for, but it's also driving huge capacity unlock because of the program. You take 20% of transactions at peak out of the line, out of POS a lot of customers benefit from less people in line and partner and customers to benefit from the fact that now our partners can concentrate more their energy on making food and beverage, on connecting with customers. And that's a big capacity and throughput unlock. And as a result, were seeing Mobile Order & Pay meet or beat all of our expectations and grow, as we mentioned, in a way that's very pleasing to us."

We're in the process of rolling that out. You'll see that across the remainder of this year. What were talking about is basically stepping up our game with regard to how we communicate with customers. And there are a couple of key components to it right now. Today, we really communicated in a targeted way via e-mail. And as we progressed through the year, you're going to begin to see the targeted communication emerge within our digital platform, specifically our app recommendations. So we don't catch people in the moment right now. We will be catching people in the moment as time goes on. So that's a very important piece. We also are going to be able to use triggers and to target much more individually than we currently do. We have limitations because of the technology right now and how many different messages we can put out. Those limitations go away with the investments in technology that we've already made. So you'll see from a customer perspective, more relevant, more targeted messages, some of which will be offers, and that will allow us to basically manage those more economically in the future."

But those won't be expensive. They won't be a big impact in the quarter. I think the only reason we said over time is obviously, we expect the momentum to build with this program.

I take my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,0",1696,"Thank you, Durga, and welcome, everyone. I take my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,000 store global retail operation again drove record financial and operating performance, including record revenues, record profits, a 7% increase in comp store sales in the U.S., a 6% increase in comp store sales globally, our 25th consecutive quarter of comp store growth at/or above 5%, and a stunning increase of 5% in transaction growth and 18% in revenue growth in China. And we remain on plan to end fiscal 2016 with approximately 25,000 stores globally. 
Our recent classes of new and remodeled retail stores continue to defy established consumer trends away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and deliver record-breaking unit sales, unit economics and return on investment, very strong performance metrics that underscore the increasing power and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. 
In light of 2 very favorable recent developments, I'd like to take a few moments to frame for you the enormity of the near-end and long-term global single-serve opportunity that lies ahead for Starbucks. As many of you know, the last 5 years Starbucks has built a powerful, sustainable, premium single-serve business operating on the Keurig K-Cup brewers. And today, Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of both premium single-serve and premium roasting ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform. For 2016, we will sell approximately 1.5 billion Starbucks K-Cups, up almost 20% over last year and representing multiples of K-Cup category growth overall. 
Last month, we extended our relationship with Keurig on highly favorable terms that provide us with improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into office and other complementary highly profitable channels of distribution. But Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America nor do they end with K-Cup. And now we have capability and a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity. Because while Keurig has the dominant share of single-serve brews in North America, it has virtually no share or relevant brewer park anywhere beyond North America. 
Outside of North America is Nestle's Espresso unit that has a leading share of premium single-serve, with a rapidly growing installed base of what we estimate to be over 25 million largely espresso-based brews in homes around the world. Espresso also has a strong presence in global away from home and hospitality channels utilizing the same capsule design it uses for at home. So here's the opportunity and it's big. For years, customers have been asking us to produce Starbucks-branded espresso-compatible capsules so they could enjoy Starbucks' quality and espresso varietals through their espresso machines, just as they do it through their K-Cup brewers in North America. While we could not satisfy that demand because we had not yet cracked the code on roasting, grinding and packing Starbucks Coffee in order to deliver Starbucks' quality in a cup through a Starbucks designed espresso-compatible capsule. But now, we have. And as we announced at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting last month, starting this fall, we will begin leveraging our retail, CPG, e-commerce, digital and loyalty assets in order to market Starbucks' espresso varietals directly to an espresso's install customer base. We're starting with Europe, espresso's largest market, and where in some countries, single-serve represents over 40% of all coffee consumed and 50% of our best Starbucks customers own an espresso machine at home. And in the future, we will begin selling Starbucks-branded espresso-compatible pods in additional Starbucks retail markets around the world. 
Improved economics and increased flexibility with Keurig in North America will combine with the new global opportunity presented by Starbucks espresso-compatibles to enable us to substantially increase the size and profitability of our single-serve business overall and to add significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. 
We also have big long-term plans for single-serve across CAP and in China. As the only truly global premium coffee brand, particularly in China, we are dearly positioned to leverage our deep connection to our customers and our unique retail store footprint could be in the forefront of single-serve in all CAP markets as the morning and at-home coffee ritual evolves. 
Let me turn to China. Starbucks has committed to China, and we now have over 2,000 stores in 100 cities in China and are adding over 10 new stores every week. Our business in China remains very strong, and I personally have no doubt that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that it's planned to double 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in the middle class in China approaching 600 million people, almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is achievable. We are building our business in China through the lens and with the learnings of the success of our business in the U.S. We're building trust in the Starbucks brand and deep authentic connections between our customers and our partners. We're continuing to look to deliver an elevated in-store experience for our customers. We've increasingly established Starbucks as the third place between home and work, and we're giving back to the communities we serve, all of which are enabling us to strengthen the equity of the Starbucks brand and develop and expand our retail, license and CPG businesses and partnerships. 
Our partnership with Tingyi that will provide us with over 1 million points of ready-to-drink Frappuccino distribution in China beginning later this quarter is just one notable example, and there'll be many that will follow. Today, not only are we building our brand in a great retail store business in China, but we are building a unique retailing capability that separates us from all other retailers and consumer brands, and that we will leverage to continue growing our China business long into the future.
And on June 16, we will open in China what will in all probability become Starbucks' highest-grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the #1 tourist attraction in Asia. Our new Shanghai Disneyland story will showcase the Starbucks Experience in all its glory and our premium coffee position and once again, underscore the power and the relevance of the Starbucks brand in China and in CAP overall. 
We're honored that the Disney Company chose Starbucks to sell, prominently greet its guests at the entrance of the new park. I am more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and I am equally convinced that as we fully roll out our new partnerships with the leading digital companies and brands in China and leverage our unique digital, mobile, card, gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China later this year and ultimately, across CAP overall, we will perform an even higher levels of success and profitability in the future than we do today. Starbucks continues to redefine the customer-facing mobile and retail experience of the future. Kevin will be taking you through how we are combining proprietary technologies, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create and leverage a dynamic integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to turn our business and propel it forward, including providing additional details around our Stars Everywhere initiative, the unique and highly opportunistic partnership we recently announced with JPMorgan Chase and Visa and our breakthrough initiatives around personalization that are enabling us to deliver highly targeted and highly profitable one-to-one marketing programs for our customers wherever they may be. 
I'm particularly proud to report that we grew our MSR loyalty program 8% by adding approximately 1 million new members in Q2 alone, and that we now have over 12 million active My Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. And the MSR program changes that took effect on April 12 will for the first time reward both customer frequency and overall spend, resulting in increased rewards for our best customers at the same time as it enhances in-store efficiency, speed of service and our customer experience overall. 
I'd like to speak for a moment about the excitement we have about the Roastery in the context of Starbucks' overall brand architecture. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight our customers and perform well ahead on original expectations. Based on experience to date, our current view is that we will ultimately open between 7 and 10 full-scale Roastery's around the world in key global cities. Our second Roastery will be opening in New York's meatpacking district on the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, next to the heavily trafficked Chelsea market, directly across its street from Google's headquarters and adjacent to Apple's downtown store in 2018. And soon, we'll be announcing details of our third Roastery, which will be in CAP. 
In addition to providing an immersive customer experience with the Roastery into the discipline and the opportunity of segmentation, we have been building a new premium brand, Starbucks Reserve. Starbucks Reserve, our ultra premium micro-lot single varietal coffees that are being sold at premium prices through select Starbucks stores around the world, creating both increased profitability and further separation from our competitors. And we will continue to open coffee-forward Starbucks stores with elevated reserve beverage and whole bean products like those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Chelsea, London and across Asia. Now following the success and the learnings from these stores, we will be opening a new class of Reserve stores beginning at fiscal 2017. We believe we have significant runway to grow and develop our Starbucks Reserve brand on a global basis. 
Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrates the continued success of our commitments to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. With humility, our performance in Q2 is particularly gratifying and that it was achieved in the face of very challenging consumer geopolitical and economic environments. 
And with that, from South Africa, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I will add additional color on our performance and provide further evidence that our strategies for growth are working. And I'll again demonstrate how we are being deliberate and focused in connection with the investments we are making for our future. 
Let's start with the Americas segment. We now have over 15,000 stores throughout the Americas business, comprises nearly 9,000 company-operated and over 6,000 licensed stores. Our Americas business continued its track record of delivering consistent, profitable growth with revenue up 10% over last year and record operating margins. Americas comp sales included a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in ticket, rounding to a 7% increase in comp sales. Our store [indiscernible] strategy is enabling introduction of new store format and faster and more efficient drive thrus, express stores and beautiful renovation that provide our customers not only with increased convenience, but a more inviting and comfortable third place environment. This approach is enabling record-setting unit volume in our new stores. The morning daypart, once again our fastest-growing daypart, grew 13% year-on-year, driven by Mobile Order & Pay, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches. Flat White and Cold Brew both continue to gain traction and customer acceptance and dry food attach. In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers. Our tea business in particular had its strongest quarter in over a year, up 17% year-on-year and contributing 1 point of comp, fueled by an accelerating sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores. Creating new customer occasions and driving increased attach are key priorities for our food programs. And we made great progress with our food business this quarter, growing revenue 16% year-on-year and contributing over 2 points to our comp with every daypart contributing to this increase. Breakfast sandwiches continue to be a strong driver of the business, delivering nearly 30% revenue growth and driving both traffic and increased attach in the morning daypart. Our innovative new lineup of lunch offerings delivered an 18% year-on-year increase in food revenue during the lunch daypart, and we continue to test and learn as we shape our evening's program. For the first time ever, food represented more than 20% of revenue in the U.S. Our Americas segment had an outstanding Q2. 
Let's now move on to the CAP segment. The China/Asia Pacific business delivered another solid quarter, with revenues increasing 14% and operating income up 15% over Q2 a year ago. Noteworthy is that this is the first full quarter in which our 1,100 store Japan retail business was fully included in both our CAP comp and revenue base, resulting in CAP comp growth of 2% in traffic and 2% in ticket, rounding to 3% overall. We now operate over 5,900 stores in CAP, including over 2,000 in Mainland China in more than 100 cities. Despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China grew revenue 18% and transactions 5% in the quarter. We saw particularly strong transaction growth in the larger cities, and our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, once again demonstrating the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the China market. As Howard mentioned, we will leverage our loyalty and digital flywheel in China with the rollout of certain features this year and full digital capabilities over time. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. While Starbucks is not immune to cyclical changes in the Chinese economy, our long-term outlook remains strong, and we're committed to increasing our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of 2019 -- fiscal '19. 
Let's move on to EMEA. We continue to build our 2,500 store EMEA business by increasing our store count, entering new countries, including Luxembourg in Q2, with South Africa, Slovakia and Andorra opening this quarter, and introducing new food and beverage offerings. Overall, we added 47 net new stores in EMEA, all in conjunction with licensee partners at high-traffic venues such as train stations, airports, supermarkets and through geographic licensees such as Alshaya in the Middle East. We continue to see strong affinity with the brand as evidenced by the opening of our first Starbucks store in Strasbourg, France, where hundreds of energized customers lined up to be among the first in the market to enjoy the Starbucks Experience. Company-operated EMEA stores delivered a 1% comp sales increase in the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. With 72% of EMEA stores now licensed or franchised, total system comps are becoming increasingly relevant. Adjusting for continued mix shift from company-owned to licensed and foreign exchange headwinds, which together impacted revenue growth by 11 points, EMEA on adjusted revenue basis will deliver growth of 7% and system comp growth of 4% as well as increasing operating income in the quarter. This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region and reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in EMEA. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see a continued mix shift to license stores in EMEA where yesterday, we announced entry into an agreement to license all 144 of our stores in Germany to an existing licensee partner, AmRest Holdings. This strategy supports our focus on store growth and expanded operating income. 
Let's move on to Channel Development. Our Channel Development segment plays a key role in elevating the Starbucks brand outside of our retail stores. Channel Development has become our second most profitable business segment and once again, delivered record revenue and record operating income, growing 8% and 17%, respectively. Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform and premium roast and ground. In this quarter, we expanded our market share position in both of those categories. Our new partnership agreement with Keurig provides us with both improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into complementary profitable channels of distribution such as hospitality, college, university and office where we consistently grow our business at 2 to 3x the industry rate. 
Our success in single-serve in the U.S. provides the foundation for a larger aspiration around the single-serve opportunity globally. Later this year, we will introduce the espresso-compatible Starbucks capsules in Europe as one step toward building a business that one day may rival the size and profitability of our single-serve business in North America. 
Our ready-to-drink business in North America continue to see very strong performance in the quarter, driven by new beverage innovation, including iced black coffee, refreshers with coconut water and product line extensions for Frappuccino and Doubleshot energy drinks. Outside of North America, we continue to make meaningful progress, building our global CPG footprint. Our partnership with Tingyi's is on track to launch this summer where we will move to a national presence with distribution in nearly every major city in China. 
Through our new agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we are enabling distribution in the Latin American market in the second half of this year. Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well and plays a key role in elevating our brand globally. 
Let's now move on to the progress we are making on our loyalty and digital initiatives. Loyalty remains the cornerstone of our digital flywheel. And in late February, we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards program that benefit our most loyal customers by leveling the playing field in rewarding both transaction frequency and total spend. With these changes, we also laid the foundation for customers to earn Stars Everywhere, which accelerates the pace at which customers earn rewards redeemable only at Starbucks. 
Rewards membership has accelerated. Just last week alone, we added more than 280,000 new rewards members. Engaging with these new rewards members will enable us to accelerate growth of our active Starbucks Rewards customer base. Besides bringing us new customers, the program also addresses an operational challenge where under the old program customers would ask baristas to bring up each item individually in order to get multiple stars, a time-consuming process that created additional work for our baristas, slowed service and lengthened lines. By completely eliminating any incentive to order split, we will improve in-store operations and efficiency and increase line speed. I want to take a moment to underscore that the changes in our rewards program will be accretive to comps over time. As we mentioned during our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, as a result of the changes to the program, we anticipate a shift of about 1 point of comp between transaction and ticket. Also, we may see some noise in Q3 comps, as customers react to the new changes of the program. Scott will speak to this further in a moment. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 12 million active Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S. with total program spend growth of 22% year-on-year. We've seen additional growth in active reward customers since the launch of the new program last week. Our new mobile app continues to be very well received, where today over 80% -- 86% of our iPhone customers and 70% of our Android customers have already upgraded to the new version of the Starbucks mobile app that released just last week. And we now have almost 19 million users of our mobile app in the U.S. alone. Mobile payment represented 24% of total U.S. tender in Q2, and Mobile Order & Pay continues to be increasingly embraced by our customers. It adds incrementality, especially at peak. Mobile Order & Pay transactions represented approximately 4% of total transactions in the quarter, which was a 40% increase sequentially. But we are just beginning to see the full benefit of Mobile Order & Pay beyond the speed and convenience that affords to both our customers and partners. Consider this. Though still its infancy, in 300 of our busiest urban stores mobile Order & Pay represents over 10% of transactions. And in those same stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay represents nearly 20% of transactions. In Portland, where we first introduced Mobile Order & Pay in December of 2014, transact -- Mobile Order & Pay transaction volume in March was up approximately 150% from March of last year. The new Starbucks Rewards program and Starbucks mobile app have positioned us for 2 very exciting initiatives that you will see unfold later this year. The first initiative through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Visa, is truly a first in its kind. A Starbucks general-purpose prepaid Visa card that will enable Starbucks Reward customers to earn Stars everywhere Visa is accepted. That's 40 million merchants worldwide. And where all stars earned can only be redeemed at Starbucks. We think this is a big win for our customers. In the U.S., total annual spending on credit and debit cards totaled around $9 trillion annually, roughly half on credit and half on debit cards. While the majority of credit cards used today offer rewards or points, typically with an annual fee, there is no meaningful debit-based rewards card program out there. That means that on more than $4 trillion of annual consumer spending, virtually no one using a debit card is getting rewards. Not anymore. This new Starbucks general-purpose prepaid reloadable debit card is unique. And not only is it a win for customers. It is also a win for Starbucks by strengthening our customer engagement and providing us with a direct financial reward for every customer we sign up and leading to attracted interchange rates. Stay tuned for more details about the card and sign-up information later this year. 
The second exciting initiative evolves around the work we are doing to enable real-time personalization. Let me frame this for you. A major contributor to the success of our rewards program has been the targeted offers that we have made to customers via e-mail. Since launching our targeted offer program in 2013, we have been providing ways for customers to earn extra Stars for purchasing certain items or making additional business to our stores. However, existing technology have constrained our ability to laser-target, respond in the moment and vary our digital content based on what we know to be an individual customer's preferences and behaviors. All that is changing as we begin to introduce true real-time personalization across our entire digital ecosystem. Following the successful implementation of the first wave of this new technology, we can now send significantly improved targeted communications to individual customers based on what we know about their specific tastes and interests, enabling us to become even more relevant to them. Over time, we will expand this capability to a more robust mobile app-centric model that enables us, at the very moment a customer orders, to provide relevant suggestions and recommendations and when appropriate, incentivize offers to delight our customers. As you can see, we are managing a significant number of accretive changes related to loyalty, digital and Stars Everywhere. 
A few words on the success of the investments we continue to make in our partners and the work we're doing to improve the partner experience overall. Creating an enhanced Starbucks Experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to the Starbucks Experience. Last year, we began rolling out a number of significant investments in support of our in-store partners that included increased barista and ship supervisor pay raise, additional performance-based recognition, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit as well as enhancements to our college achievement program. These investments are paying off. We continue to see increases in partner retention, which is enabling better customer connections, and customer connection is a key driver of our record Q2 performance. As you can see, our results provide powerful evidence that our strategies and focused investments are paying off today and setting us up for continued growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?"
34745,311935472,961475,"Starbucks Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating inc",1714,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating income, operating margin and EPS. Noteworthy is that our revenues in Q2 were the highest of any nonholiday quarter in our history. EPS, both GAAP and non-GAAP, increased 18% to $0.39 in Q2, the top end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% over Q2 last year at $887 million, while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.6%. Margin improvement in Q2 was driven by sales leverage that more than offset the impact of ongoing investments, particularly in our partners and our digital platforms. It's important to note this quarter that our consolidated operating margin also reflects dilution from a multiyear employment tax audit accrual. More specifically, our 30 basis point increase in operating margin would have been 40 basis points higher or 70 basis points in total, and our operating income growth would have been 240 basis points higher than the reported 11% or 14% with rounding. The impact of this G&A-related accrual was largely offset below the operating income line in Q2 income taxes and is expected to be entirely offset in federal income tax expense by fiscal year-end, resulting in no impact to earnings for full year 2016. You may recall that our Investor Day in December 2014, we discussed the importance of reversing the negative leverage we were seeing on cost of goods sold and G&A. I'm pleased to report that the plan we put in place to do so are working. And that on top of the significant progress we made on that front last year, so far this year, we are seeing an additional 60 basis points of COGS and occupancy leverage, driven mostly by COGS and 40 basis points of G&A leverage. 
Return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, once again reflecting excellent returns on our core businesses and demonstrating the outsized return we are generating on many of our significant newer investments. And our reported record Q2 results became even more noteworthy in light of the fact that foreign currency translation shaved a full point off revenue and 2 points off operating income growth in the quarter. 
I'll now take you through how each of our major operating segments performed in Q2. In Q2, our Americas segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points over Q2 last year to 23.5%, primarily driven by sales leverage and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by ongoing store partner and digital platform investments that together adversely impacted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter. Noteworthy again, as we mentioned last quarter, is that we continue to see essentially no net cannibalization of existing stores as we expand our store footprint in the Americas and leverage our full portfolio of new and existing store formats. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the Americas segment to deliver moderate margin expansion over prior year. 
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. In Q2, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 15% over last year to a Q2 record $129 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of increased compensation and benefit costs in store operating expenses. Excluding the 90 basis point impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter. Profitability of our Japan and China store portfolio continues to increase with our profitability of our store class up nicely from the previous age class. 
And as Kevin mentioned, returns on our new stores in these 2 important markets are among the highest Starbucks is generating anywhere in the world. For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect CAP revenue growth to be within our previously stated mid-teens target range, and CAP margins are now expected to be roughly flat compared to 2015 levels. We also still expect CAP comps for the year to be in the mid-single digits despite falling just below that threshold for the current quarter, somewhat impacted by the addition of our Japan business into the CAP comp calculation. Japan is the largest component of the CAP comp base with a weighting of just over 50% of the total.
Turning to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 10 basis points in Q2 relative to last year to 10.3%, largely due to certain gains in the prior year related to the sale of assets as we shifted more stores from company-operated to our license model. Excluding these gains and the impact of FX headwinds, EMEA's operating margin expanded slightly in Q2. As Kevin mentioned, our license stores in EMEA showed strong comp and profitability growth in Q2, and income from licensees now represents roughly 60% of the total operating income we generate from EMEA. Despite challenging macroeconomic geopolitical and consumer environments that persist across the EMEA region, we remain confident that EMEA's operating margins will approach 15% in fiscal 2016, once again up nicely over the prior year.
Our Channel Development segment had another very strong quarter in Q2. Operating margin increased 300 basis points in the quarter to 39.5%, and operating income reached a new quarterly record of $182 million, up 17% over last year, driven primarily by cost of sales leverage, favorable coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. For the full fiscal year, we expect Channel Development to increase revenues by approximately 10% year-over-year with the back half of the year growing in the high single digits following the 12% growth rate we saw in the first 6 months. Channel Development's record-breaking Q1 performance, very strong Q2 results and positive outlook for the balance of the year has us confident that the segment will post moderate margin expansion in fiscal 2016 over last year. 
Given the momentum we are seeing in the business, we are also expecting strong operating leverage over the next 2 quarters. 
Given the excellent performance across the company year-to-date, we are moving the bottom end of our fiscal year 2016 EPS range up slightly from our previous guidance while retaining the top end. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the 53rd week, which by our rough estimate, adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. For Q3, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.49. For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 1 to 2 points and operating income growth by 2 to 3 points. We continue to expect to grow revenues by 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to the full fiscal year figure. 
And we remain confident in our ability to deliver
Comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year 2016. But as Kevin indicated, there exists a potential for some bumpiness in Q3 as a result of the Starbucks Rewards program changes that took effect earlier this month. And as we've mentioned on our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, going forward, we expect to see a point or so of movement between traffic and ticket within comp in each of the next 4 quarters as our customers adapt to the changes. Noteworthy is that given the significant value and benefits conferred on our customers in the new program, we fully expect the changes to be accretive to each of comps, revenue and profitability over time. Investment in our partner and digital initiatives globally will total between $275 million and $300 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015, and the benefits and the returns we are realizing from these investments are becoming increasingly apparent. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities with 2016 cost -- coffee needs fully priced, we expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We will continue to take careful advantage of lower coffee prices while ensuring that we source only the highest-quality coffee and provide fair economics to coffee growers around the globe. We expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 34%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1. We returned $1.6 million to shareholders in Q2 alone, the highest amount in any single quarter in our 24-year history as a publicly traded company, with share repurchases in the quarter nearly equal to buyback activity in all of 2015. And as we announced today, our Board of Directors recently increased our share buyback authority by an additional 100 million shares. 
As I mentioned at the outset, Q2 was another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial, operating and profit performance for Starbucks. And once again, the credit goes to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers every day. The tremendous momentum we have created over the first half of fiscal 2016 ideally positions us to benefit from the investments we are making in our partners, in our stores and in groundbreaking innovations and to continue delivering world-class returns to our shareholders. And we will do so despite today's challenging global economic and geopolitical landscape.

We've talked before about the tie between the changes we made about a year ago in pay for our U.S. store partners and the increase in comps that started at the same time. And in fact, what we see is at the stores that have the lowest turnover, they have the highest comps. And we've seen turnover ticked down since we made those changes. So with all tied together, it's highly accretive and highly profitable. So we'll continue to make those investments. And as we go into each year, we'll talk a little bit about the size of those investments, the impact on leverage. But there are other places in the P&L that we can go to continue to grow EPS at 15% to 20%, which is our long-term range, G&A and COGS just being 2 of them. And then [Audio Gap] team has done a nice job driving productivity on -- in the stores, and Mobile Order & Pay has been a key aspect of that to help us with throughput at peak. And as Kevin said, peak was once again our fastest-growing daypart in this quarter. Last quarter was our fastest-growing daypart in over 5 years. And as you know, last quarter is the first quarter we had Mobile Order & Pay fully rolled out. And what we're seeing based upon the numbers that Kevin showed is in those busiest stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay is driving significant productivity and throughput. So those are all places elsewhere in the P&L we can go to fund the investments we need to drive growth."

First off, obviously, from a CAP perspective, the composition of comp has changed dramatically over the past year with the weighting of Japan coming in. If you go back a year ago, sequentially, Japan was not included in the comp base at all in '15. It was only partially included in Q1. And now we have it fully included in Q2. When you look at the total comp growth for the region, we came in at a rounding basis of 3%, 2% of that was transactions and 2% was ticket. But more importantly, when you go into China and you dig underneath China, we delivered a 5% transaction growth rate across the country. And when you dig in deeper into that, in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we have over 65% of our stores, we outpaced that 5% growth, transaction growth rate significantly. So for us, we have great optimism around the opportunity that exists for us in China as well as in Japan. We continue to see very strong new store performance, as Scott highlighted, in both China and Japan with record revenues and record sales results and significant return on investment. So for us, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists not only in China, but then also across the entire segment."

We are gaining share across all categories that we operate in, whether it's the roast and ground category, premium coffee or K-Cups. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of share growth in the channel development business across all categories. And in the quarter, we grew 5x the category average, and our shares increased over 100 basis points. Roast and ground, we now have a 25.3% share growth. In K-Cups, share now sits at 16.3%. And when you look at the success that we're having in channel, a couple things are driving it. First is the execution that we're seeing in the stores and the merchandising that we're doing and the fact that we're winning down the aisle. It's the fact that we're increasing our points of distribution. We've seen significant success with the larger pack size that we've introduced. And clearly, that's been driving our share gains across all our major categories. In addition, we've taken the My Starbucks Rewards program and introduced that down the aisle as well, where in the quarter, we saw an 18% increase in the number of codes that were redeemed. And to date, we have over 20 million codes entered by over 2 million MSR customers in the CPG segment.

And Keith, on your second question, what I would say is in the near term, the new Green Mountain agreement doesn't go into place until later this quarter. So not -- a little bit more than a quarter impact in this year's earnings. Over the long term, there could be upside to the range that we gave back at Investor Day. And I think one of the key pieces to that is all of the international opportunities that Kevin and John laid out. And so I think as you look in international CPG growth, particularly over the medium term, out a couple of 3 years, once the partnerships get up and running and we get product rolling off the lines, if those things go as well as we expected, there could be some upside there."

When you look at K-Cups, we grew more than 3x the rate of the category this past quarter. And the new Keurig agreement gives us an opportunity to extend agreement number one on very favorable terms. We have improved economics coming in, as Scott highlighted. But more importantly, we have greater operating flexibility in terms of being able to drive more innovation into the K-Cup category, additional SKUs and new packaging. And we also have the opportunity to now sell the K-Cups directly into office, into foodservice, college and universities, hotels and C-stores. So we're on track this year to do about 1.5 billion K-Cups, and we expect this category to push near the 20% growth rate for the entire year for us. So very optimistic on the opportunity that K-Cups has."

I think the other thing just regarding daypart, we are seeing growth across all dayparts being led by the morning. So we're very, very pleased with it. And the EMV or the chip-and-PIN, is negligible at the moment.

This is Adam. So first of all, as we mentioned in the remarks earlier, our overall average number of transactions for Mobile Order & Pay is 4% across all stores, all dayparts, all store types in the U.S. But that's just the beginning of the store with Mobile Order & Pay. First of all, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, over 10% of all orders at our busiest 300 stores are mobile orders, and if you know that we're seeing mobile orders comprise 7% of all orders at our busiest 1,200 stores. So when you really look at our busiest stores, Mobile Order & Pay is very important. And drilling into that further, when you look at the busiest [Audio Gap] peak for those 300 busiest stores for example, mobile orders are already approaching 20% of transactions at those peak hours. So you're really seeing Mobile Order & Pay benefiting all customers. It's benefiting overall store performance in all these stores because of the incrementality and throughput unlocked. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay is allowing customers convenience so they can have that incremental visit, incremental occasion they wouldn't normally have time for, but it's also driving huge capacity unlock because of the program. You take 20% of transactions at peak out of the line, out of POS, you see the benefit at all stores, allow our customers to benefit from less people in line and allow our partners and customers to benefit from the fact that now our partners can concentrate more their energy on making food and beverage, on connecting with customers. And that's a big capacity and throughput unlock. And as a result, we're seeing Mobile Order & Pay meet or beat all of our expectations and grow, as we mentioned, in a way that's very pleasing to us."

And I think the better part is ours just to say to you upfront that there could be some noise in the quarter. We're not signaling anything. As Matt said, we're building something so significant over the long term that I wouldn't be so concerned about noise in the quarter if there is some because what's happening here is we're building something so enduring and so unique that I think it's going to be one of the most significant changes to the equity of the brand, customer experience. And as Kevin has said earlier, the opportunity for Stars Everywhere in terms of ubiquity of people using that debit card and the only way they can bring back Stars in their rewards is Starbucks going to be a significant flywheel effect on our overall business. So we just wanted to be open with you about the complication and the degree of the significant change, but the long term is so beneficial to our customers and obviously to our shareholders."

Andy, I'm not going to disclose who we're working with from a manufacturing standpoint, only to say that we are in a position now to launch the Nespresso-compatible pods in both our retail stores as well as through the CPG channels across the U.K. and France later this year. We are focusing first and foremost on Europe because there's 25 million machines of Nespresso machines that are installed there. It's a very similar size right now in comparison to the number of installed base on Keurig here in the U.S. And we feel there's a significant opportunity to build this capsule business similar to the way we built the K-Cup business here in the U.S. And as Howard highlighted on his comments, single-serve represents 40% of the coffee consumed in home in Europe. And nearly 50% of our Starbucks customers have Nespresso machines in their homes. And so we see this as being a big opportunity. Beyond Europe, the big size of the price is going to be in CAP and, more importantly, in China. And we are going to continue to look at how we expand the single-serve opportunity as the only truly leading global premium coffee brand in Asia across our store footprint and really go after this opportunity as well. So looking forward to the growth opportunity that exists, both in Europe as well as in Asia around the single-serve opportunity."

But those won't be expensive. They won't be a big impact in the quarter. I think the only reason we said over time is obviously, we expect the momentum to build with this program.

I taped my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks' 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24",1695,"Thank you, Durga, and welcome, everyone. I taped my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg where earlier today, we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks' 71st international market. In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,000 store global retail operation again drove record financial and operating performance, including record revenues, record profits, a 7% increase in comp store sales in the U.S., a 6% increase in comp store sales globally, our 25th consecutive quarter of comp store growth at/or above 5%, and a stunning increase of 5% in transaction growth and 18% in revenue growth in China. And we remain on plan to end fiscal 2016 with approximately 25,000 stores globally. 
Our recent classes of new and remodeled retail stores continue to defy established consumer trends away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and deliver record-breaking unit sales, unit economics and return on investment, very strong performance metrics that underscore the increasing power and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. 
In light of 2 very favorable recent developments, I'd like to take a few moments to frame for you the enormity of the near-end and long-term global single-serve opportunity that lies ahead for Starbucks. As many of you know, the last 5 years Starbucks has built a powerful, sustainable, premium single-serve business operating on the Keurig K-Cup rails. And today, Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of both premium single-serve and premium roasting ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform. For 2016, we will sell approximately 1.5 billion Starbucks K-Cups, up almost 20% over last year and representing multiples of K-Cup category growth overall. 
Last month, we extended our relationship with Keurig on highly favorable terms that provide us with improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into office and other complementary highly profitable channels of distribution. But Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America nor do they end with K-Cup. And now we have capability and a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity. Because while Keurig has the dominant share of single-serve brewers in North America, it has virtually no share or relevant brewer park anywhere beyond North America. 
Outside of North America is Nestle's Nespresso unit that has a leading share of premium single-serve, with a rapidly growing installed base of what we estimate to be over 25 million largely espresso-based brewers in homes around the world. Nespresso also has a strong presence in global away from home and hospitality channels utilizing the same capsule design it uses for at home. So here's the opportunity and it's big. For years, customers have been asking us to produce Starbucks-branded Nespresso-compatible capsules so they could enjoy Starbucks' quality and espresso varietals through their Nespresso machines, just as they do it through their K-Cup brewers in North America. Well we could not satisfy that demand because we had not yet cracked the code on roasting, grinding and packing Starbucks Coffee in order to deliver Starbucks' quality in a cup through a Starbucks designed Nespresso-compatible capsule. But now, we have. 
And as we announced at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting last month, starting this fall, we will begin leveraging our retail, CPG, e-commerce, digital and loyalty assets in order to market Starbucks' espresso varietals directly to an Nespresso's install customer base. We're starting with Europe, Nespresso's largest market, and where in some countries, single-serve represents over 40% of all coffee consumed and 50% of our best Starbucks customers own a Nespresso machine at home. And in the future, we will begin selling Starbucks-branded Nespresso-compatible pods in additional Starbucks retail markets around the world. 
Improved economics and increased flexibility with Keurig in North America will combine with the new global opportunity presented by Starbucks Nespresso-compatibles to enable us to substantially increase the size and profitability of our single-serve business overall and to add significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead. 
We also have big long-term plans for single-serve across CAP and in China. As the only truly global premium coffee brand, particularly in China, we are ideally positioned to leverage our deep connection to our customers and our unique retail store footprint to be in the forefront of single-serve in all CAP markets as the morning and at-home coffee ritual evolves. 
Let me turn to China. Starbucks has committed to China, and we now have over 2,000 stores in 100 cities in China and are adding over 10 new stores every week. Our business in China remains very strong, and I personally have no doubt that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its plan to double 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in the middle class in China approaching 600 million people, almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is achievable. We are building our business in China through the lens and with the learnings of the success of our business in the U.S. We're building trust in the Starbucks brand and deep authentic connections between our customers and our partners. 
We're continuing to look to deliver an elevated in-store experience for our customers. We've increasingly established Starbucks as the third place between home and work, and we're giving back to the communities we serve, all of which are enabling us to strengthen the equity of the Starbucks brand and develop and expand our retail, license and CPG businesses and partnerships. 
Our partnership with Tingyi that will provide us with over 1 million points of ready-to-drink Frappuccino distribution in China beginning later this quarter is just one notable example, and there'll be many that will follow. Today, not only are we building our brand in a great retail store business in China, but we are building a unique retailing capability that separates us from all other retailers and consumer brands, and that we will leverage to continue growing our China business long into the future.
And on June 16, we will open in China what will in all probability become Starbucks' highest-grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the #1 tourist attraction in Asia. Our new Shanghai Disneyland store will showcase the Starbucks Experience in all its glory and our premium coffee position and once again, underscore the power and the relevance of the Starbucks brand in China and in CAP overall. 
We're honored that the Disney Company chose Starbucks to so prominently greet its guests at the entrance of the new park. I am more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and I am equally convinced that as we fully roll out our new partnerships with the leading digital companies and brands in China and leverage our unique digital, mobile, card, gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China later this year and ultimately, across CAP overall, we will perform an even higher levels of success and profitability in the future than we do today. 
Starbucks continues to redefine the customer-facing mobile and retail experience of the future. Kevin will be taking you through how we are combining proprietary technologies, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create and leverage a dynamic integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to turn our business and propel it forward, including providing additional details around our Stars Everywhere initiative, the unique and highly opportunistic partnership we recently announced with JPMorgan Chase and Visa and our breakthrough initiatives around personalization that are enabling us to deliver highly targeted and highly profitable one-to-one marketing programs for our customers wherever they may be. 
I'm particularly proud to report that we grew our MSR loyalty program 8% by adding approximately 1 million new members in Q2 alone, and that we now have over 12 million active My Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. And the MSR program changes that took effect on April 12 will for the first time reward both customer frequency and overall spend, resulting in increased rewards for our best customers at the same time as it enhances in-store efficiency, speed of service and our customer experience overall. 
I'd like to speak for a moment about the excitement we have about the Roastery in the context of Starbucks' overall brand architecture. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight our customers and perform well ahead on original expectations. Based on experience to date, our current view is that we will ultimately open between 7 and 10 full-scale Roasterys around the world in key global cities. Our second Roastery will be opening in New York's meatpacking district on the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, next to the heavily trafficked Chelsea Market, directly across its street from Google's headquarters and adjacent to Apple's downtown store in 2018. And soon, we'll be announcing details of our third Roastery, which will be in CAP. 
In addition to providing an immersive customer experience with the Roastery into the discipline and the opportunity of segmentation, we have been building a new premium brand, Starbucks Reserve. Starbucks Reserve, our ultra-premium micro-lot single varietal coffees that are being sold at premium prices through select Starbucks stores around the world, creating both increased profitability and further separation from our competitors. And we will continue to open coffee-forward Starbucks stores with elevated reserve beverage and whole bean products like those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Chelsea, London and across Asia. Now following the success and the learnings from these stores, we will be opening a new class of Reserve stores beginning at fiscal 2017. We believe we have significant runway to grow and develop our Starbucks Reserve brand on a global basis. 
Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrates the continued success of our commitments to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. With humility, our performance in Q2 is particularly gratifying and that it was achieved in the face of very challenging consumer geopolitical and economic environments. 
And with that, from South Africa, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

I will add additional color on our performance and provide further evidence that our strategies for growth are working. And I'll again demonstrate how we are being deliberate and focused in connection with the investments we are making for our future. 
Let's start with the Americas segment. We now have over 15,000 stores throughout the Americas business, comprises nearly 9,000 company-operated and over 6,000 licensed stores. Our Americas business continued its track record of delivering consistent, profitable growth with revenue up 10% over last year and record operating margins. Americas comp sales included a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in ticket, rounding to a 7% increase in comp sales. Our store [indiscernible] corporate strategy is enabling introduction of new store format and faster and more efficient drive thrus, express stores and beautiful renovation that provide our customers not only with increased convenience, but a more inviting and comfortable third place environment. This approach is enabling record-setting unit volume in our new stores. 
The morning daypart, once again our fastest-growing daypart, grew 13% year-on-year, driven by Mobile Order & Pay, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches. Flat White and Cold Brew both continue to gain traction and customer acceptance and dry food attach. In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers. Our tea business in particular had its strongest quarter in over a year, up 17% year-on-year and contributing 1 point of comp, fueled by an accelerating sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores. 
Creating new customer occasions and driving increased attach are key priorities for our food programs. And we made great progress with our food business this quarter, growing revenue 16% year-on-year and contributing over 2 points to our comp with every daypart contributing to this increase. Breakfast sandwiches continue to be a strong driver of the business, delivering nearly 30% revenue growth and driving both traffic and increased attach in the morning daypart. Our innovative new lineup of lunch offerings delivered an 18% year-on-year increase in food revenue during the lunch daypart, and we continue to test and learn as we shape our evening's program. For the first time ever, food represented more than 20% of revenue in the U.S. Our Americas segment had an outstanding Q2. 
Let's now move on to the CAP segment. The China/Asia Pacific business delivered another solid quarter, with revenues increasing 14% and operating income up 15% over Q2 a year ago. Noteworthy is that this is the first full quarter in which our 1,100 store Japan retail business was fully included in both our CAP comp and revenue base, resulting in CAP comp growth of 2% in traffic and 2% in ticket, rounding to 3% overall. We now operate over 5,900 stores in CAP, including over 2,000 in Mainland China in more than 100 cities. Despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China grew revenue 18% and transactions 5% in the quarter. We saw particularly strong transaction growth in the larger cities, and our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, once again demonstrating the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the China market. As Howard mentioned, we will leverage our loyalty and digital flywheel in China with the rollout of certain features this year and full digital capabilities over time. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. While Starbucks is not immune to cyclical changes in the Chinese economy, our long-term outlook remains strong, and we're committed to increasing our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of 2019 -- fiscal '19. 
Let's move on to EMEA. We continue to build our 2,500 store EMEA business by increasing our store count, entering new countries, including Luxembourg in Q2, with South Africa, Slovakia and Andorra opening this quarter, and introducing new food and beverage offerings. Overall, we added 47 net new stores in EMEA, all in conjunction with licensee partners at high-traffic venues such as train stations, airports, supermarkets and through geographic licensees such as Alshaya in the Middle East. We continue to see strong affinity with the brand as evidenced by the opening of our first Starbucks store in Strasbourg, France, where hundreds of energized customers lined up to be among the first in the market to enjoy the Starbucks Experience. 
Company-operated EMEA stores delivered a 1% comp sales increase in the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. With 72% of EMEA stores now licensed or franchised, total system comps are becoming increasingly relevant. Adjusting for continued mix shift from company-owned to licensed and foreign exchange headwinds, which together impacted revenue growth by 11 points, EMEA on adjusted revenue basis will deliver growth of 7% and system comp growth of 4% as well as increasing operating income in the quarter. This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region and reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in EMEA. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see a continued mix shift to license stores in EMEA where yesterday, we announced entry into an agreement to license all 144 of our stores in Germany to an existing licensee partner, AmRest Holdings. This strategy supports our focus on store growth and expanded operating income. 
Let's move on to Channel Development. Our Channel Development segment plays a key role in elevating the Starbucks brand outside of our retail stores. Channel Development has become our second most profitable business segment and once again, delivered record revenue and record operating income, growing 8% and 17%, respectively. Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform and premium roast and ground. In this quarter, we expanded our market share position in both of those categories. Our new partnership agreement with Keurig provides us with both improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into complementary profitable channels of distribution such as hospitality, college/university and office where we consistently grow our business at 2 to 3x the industry rate. 
Our success in single-serve in the U.S. provides the foundation for a larger aspiration around the single-serve opportunity globally. Later this year, we will introduce the Nespresso-compatible Starbucks capsules in Europe as one step toward building a business that one day may rival the size and profitability of our single-serve business in North America. 
Our ready-to-drink business in North America continue to see very strong performance in the quarter, driven by new beverage innovation, including iced black coffee, refreshers with coconut water and product line extensions for Frappuccino and Doubleshot energy drinks. Outside of North America, we continue to make meaningful progress, building our global CPG footprint. Our partnership with Tingyi's is on track to launch this summer where we will move to a national presence with distribution in nearly every major city in China. 
Through our new agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we are enabling distribution in the Latin American market in the second half of this year. Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well and plays a key role in elevating our brand globally. 
Let's now move on to the progress we are making on our loyalty and digital initiatives. Loyalty remains the cornerstone of our digital flywheel. And in late February, we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards program that benefit our most loyal customers by leveling the playing field in rewarding both transaction frequency and total spend. With these changes, we also laid the foundation for customers to earn Stars Everywhere, which accelerates the pace at which customers earn rewards redeemable only at Starbucks. 
Rewards membership has accelerated. Just last week alone, we added more than 280,000 new rewards members. Engaging with these new rewards members will enable us to accelerate growth of our active Starbucks Rewards customer base. Besides bringing us new customers, the program also addresses an operational challenge where under the old program customers would ask baristas to ring up each item individually in order to get multiple stars, a time-consuming process that created additional work for our baristas, slowed service and lengthened lines. By completely eliminating any incentive to order split, we will improve in-store operations and efficiency and increase line speed. 
I want to take a moment to underscore that the changes in our rewards program will be accretive to comps over time. As we mentioned during our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, as a result of the changes to the program, we anticipate a shift of about 1 point of comp between transaction and ticket. Also, we may see some noise in Q3 comps, as customers react to the new changes of the program. Scott will speak to this further in a moment. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 12 million active Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S. with total program spend growth of 22% year-on-year. We've seen additional growth in active reward customers since the launch of the new program last week. Our new mobile app continues to be very well received, where today over 80% -- 86% of our iPhone customers and 70% of our Android customers have already upgraded to the new version of the Starbucks mobile app that released just last week. And we now have almost 19 million users of our mobile app in the U.S. alone. 
Mobile payment represented 24% of total U.S. tender in Q2, and Mobile Order & Pay continues to be increasingly embraced by our customers. It adds incrementality, especially at peak. Mobile Order & Pay transactions represented approximately 4% of total transactions in the quarter, which was a 40% increase sequentially. But we are just beginning to see the full benefit of Mobile Order & Pay beyond the speed and convenience it affords to both our customers and partners. Consider this. Though still its infancy, in 300 of our busiest urban stores Mobile Order & Pay represents over 10% of transactions. And in those same stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay represents nearly 20% of transactions. 
In Portland, where we first introduced Mobile Order & Pay in December of 2014, transact -- Mobile Order & Pay transaction volume in March was up approximately 150% from March of last year. The new Starbucks Rewards program and Starbucks mobile app have positioned us for 2 very exciting initiatives that you will see unfold later this year. The first initiative through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Visa, is truly a first in its kind. A Starbucks general-purpose prepaid Visa card that will enable Starbucks Reward customers to earn Stars everywhere Visa is accepted. 
That's 40 million merchants worldwide. And where all stars earned can only be redeemed at Starbucks. We think this is a big win for our customers. In the U.S., total annual spending on credit and debit cards totaled around $9 trillion annually, roughly half on credit and half on debit cards. While the majority of credit cards used today offer rewards or points, typically with an annual fee, there is no meaningful debit-based rewards card program out there. That means that on more than $4 trillion of annual consumer spending, virtually no one using a debit card is getting rewards. Not anymore. This new Starbucks general-purpose prepaid reloadable debit card is unique. And not only is it a win for customers. It is also a win for Starbucks by strengthening our customer engagement and providing us with a direct financial reward for every customer we sign up and leading to attractive interchange rates. Stay tuned for more details about the card and sign-up information later this year. 
The second exciting initiative evolves around the work we are doing to enable real-time personalization. Let me frame this for you. A major contributor to the success of our rewards program has been the targeted offers that we have made to customers via e-mail. Since launching our targeted offer program in 2013, we have been providing ways for customers to earn extra Stars for purchasing certain items or making additional business to our stores. However, existing technology constrained our ability to laser-target, respond in the moment and vary our digital content based on what we know to be an individual customer's preferences and behaviors. All that is changing as we begin to introduce true real-time personalization across our entire digital ecosystem. Following the successful implementation of the first wave of this new technology, we can now send significantly improved targeted communications to individual customers based on what we know about their specific tastes and interests, enabling us to become even more relevant to them. Over time, we will expand this capability to a more robust mobile app-centric model that enables us, at the very moment a customer orders, to provide relevant suggestions and recommendations and when appropriate, incentivize offers to delight our customers. As you can see, we are managing a significant number of accretive changes related to loyalty, digital and Stars Everywhere. 
A few words on the success of the investments we continue to make in our partners and the work we're doing to improve the partner experience overall. Creating an enhanced Starbucks Experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to the Starbucks Experience. Last year we began rolling out a number of significant investments in support of our in-store partners that included increased barista and ship supervisor pay raise, additional performance-based recognition, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit as well as enhancements to our college achievement program. These investments are paying off. We continue to see increases in partner retention, which is enabling better customer connections, and customer connection is a key driver of our record Q2 performance. 
As you can see, our results provide powerful evidence that our strategies and focused investments are paying off today and setting us up for continued growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?"
34745,311935472,961546,"Starbucks Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating inc",1715,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating income, operating margin and EPS. Noteworthy is that our revenues in Q2 were the highest of any nonholiday quarter in our history. EPS, both GAAP and non-GAAP, increased 18% to $0.39 in Q2, the top end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% over Q2 last year at $887 million, while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.6%. Margin improvement in Q2 was driven by sales leverage that more than offset the impact of ongoing investments, particularly in our partners and our digital platforms. It's important to note this quarter that our consolidated operating margin also reflects dilution from a multiyear employment tax audit accrual. More specifically, our 30 basis point increase in operating margin would have been 40 basis points higher or 70 basis points in total, and our operating income growth would have been 240 basis points higher than the reported 11% or 14% with rounding. The impact of this G&A-related accrual was largely offset below the operating income line in Q2 income taxes and is expected to be entirely offset in federal income tax expense by fiscal year-end, resulting in no impact to earnings for full year 2016. You may recall that our Investor Day in December 2014, we discussed the importance of reversing the negative leverage we were seeing on cost of goods sold and G&A. I'm pleased to report that the plan we put in place to do so are working. And that on top of the significant progress we made on that front last year, so far this year, we are seeing an additional 60 basis points of COGS and occupancy leverage, driven mostly by COGS and 40 basis points of G&A leverage. 
Return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, once again reflecting excellent returns on our core businesses and demonstrating the outsized return we are generating on many of our significant newer investments. And our reported record Q2 results became even more noteworthy in light of the fact that foreign currency translation shaved a full point off revenue and 2 points off operating income growth in the quarter. 
I'll now take you through how each of our major operating segments performed in Q2. In Q2, our Americas segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points over Q2 last year to 23.5%, primarily driven by sales leverage and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by ongoing store partner and digital platform investments that together adversely impacted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter. Noteworthy again, as we mentioned last quarter, is that we continue to see essentially no net cannibalization of existing stores as we expand our store footprint in the Americas and leverage our full portfolio of new and existing store formats. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the Americas segment to deliver moderate margin expansion over prior year. 
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. In Q2, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 15% over last year to a Q2 record $129 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of increased compensation and benefit costs in store operating expenses. Excluding the 90 basis point impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter. Profitability of our Japan and China store portfolio continues to increase with our profitability of our store class up nicely from the previous age class. 
And as Kevin mentioned, returns on our new stores in these 2 important markets are among the highest Starbucks is generating anywhere in the world. For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect CAP revenue growth to be within our previously stated mid-teens target range, and CAP margins are now expected to be roughly flat compared to 2015 levels. We also still expect CAP comps for the year to be in the mid-single digits despite falling just below that threshold for the current quarter, somewhat impacted by the addition of our Japan business into the CAP comp calculation. Japan is the largest component of the CAP comp base with a weighting of just over 50% of the total.
Turning to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 10 basis points in Q2 relative to last year to 10.3%, largely due to certain gains in the prior year related to the sale of assets as we shifted more stores from company-operated to our license model. Excluding these gains and the impact of FX headwinds, EMEA's operating margin expanded slightly in Q2. As Kevin mentioned, our license stores in EMEA showed strong comp and profitability growth in Q2, and income from licensees now represents roughly 60% of the total operating income we generate from EMEA. Despite challenging macroeconomic geopolitical and consumer environments that persist across the EMEA region, we remain confident that EMEA's operating margins will approach 15% in fiscal 2016, once again up nicely over the prior year.
Our Channel Development segment had another very strong quarter in Q2. Operating margin increased 300 basis points in the quarter to 39.5%, and operating income reached a new quarterly record of $182 million, up 17% over last year, driven primarily by cost of sales leverage, favorable coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. For the full fiscal year, we expect Channel Development to increase revenues by approximately 10% year-over-year with the back half of the year growing in the high single digits following the 12% growth rate we saw in the first 6 months. Channel Development's record-breaking Q1 performance, very strong Q2 results and positive outlook for the balance of the year has us confident that the segment will post moderate margin expansion in fiscal 2016 over last year. 
Given the momentum we are seeing in the business, we are also expecting strong operating leverage over the next 2 quarters. 
Given the excellent performance across the company year-to-date, we are moving the bottom end of our fiscal year 2016 EPS range up slightly from our previous guidance while retaining the top end. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the 53rd week, which by our rough estimate, adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. For Q3, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.49. For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 1 to 2 points and operating income growth by 2 to 3 points. We continue to expect to grow revenues by 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to the full fiscal year figure. 
And we remain confident in our ability to deliver
Comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year 2016. But as Kevin indicated, there exists a potential for some bumpiness in Q3 as a result of the Starbucks Rewards program changes that took effect earlier this month. And as we've mentioned on our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, going forward, we expect to see a point or so of movement between traffic and ticket within comp in each of the next 4 quarters as our customers adapt to the changes. Noteworthy is that given the significant value and benefits conferred on our customers in the new program, we fully expect the changes to be accretive to each of comps, revenue and profitability over time. Investment in our partner and digital initiatives globally will total between $275 million and $300 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015, and the benefits and the returns we are realizing from these investments are becoming increasingly apparent. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities with 2016 cost -- coffee needs fully priced, we expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We will continue to take careful advantage of lower coffee prices while ensuring that we source only the highest-quality coffee and provide fair economics to coffee growers around the globe. We expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 34%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1. We returned $1.6 billion [ph] to shareholders in Q2 alone, the highest amount in any single quarter in our 24-year history as a publicly traded company, with share repurchases in the quarter nearly equal to buyback activity in all of 2015. And as we announced today, our Board of Directors recently increased our share buyback authority by an additional 100 million shares. 
As I mentioned at the outset, Q2 was another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial, operating and profit performance for Starbucks. And once again, the credit goes to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers every day. The tremendous momentum we have created over the first half of fiscal 2016 ideally positions us to benefit from the investments we are making in our partners, in our stores and in groundbreaking innovations and to continue delivering world-class returns to our shareholders. And we will do so despite today's challenging global economic and geopolitical landscape.

the team have done a nice job driving productivity on -- in the stores, and Mobile Order & Pay has been a key aspect of that to help us with throughput at peak. And as Kevin said, peak was once again our fastest-growing daypart in this quarter. Last quarter was our fastest-growing daypart in over 5 years. And as you know, last quarter is the first quarter we had Mobile Order & Pay fully rolled out. And what we're seeing based upon the numbers that Kevin showed is in those busiest stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay is driving significant productivity and throughput. So those are all places elsewhere in the P&L we can go to fund the investments we need to drive growth."

First off, obviously, from a CAP perspective, the composition of comp has changed dramatically over the past year with the weighting of Japan coming in. If you go back a year ago, sequentially, Japan was not included in the comp base at all in '15 and it was only partially included in Q1. And now we have it fully included in Q2. When you look at the total comp growth for the region, we came in at a rounding basis of 3%, 2% of that was transactions and 2% was ticket. But more importantly, when you go into China and you dig underneath China, we delivered a 5% transaction growth rate across the country. And when you dig even deeper into that, in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we have over 65% of our stores, we outpaced that 5% growth, transaction growth rate significantly. So for us, we have great optimism around the opportunity that exists for us in China as well as in Japan. We continue to see very strong new store performance, as Scott highlighted, in both China and Japan with record revenues and record sales results and significant return on investment. So for us, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists not only in China, but then also across the entire segment."

Let me take the first part of the question, then I'll turn the second piece over to Scott. Clearly, channel development continues to perform very, very strong for us as a company with the 8% revenue and 17% income growth in the quarter. We are gaining share across all categories that we operate in, whether it's the roast and ground category, premium coffee or K-Cups. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of share growth in the channel development business across all categories. And in the quarter, we grew 5x the category average, and our shares increased over 100 basis points. Roast and ground, we now have a 25.3% share growth. In K-Cups, share now sits at 16.3%. And when you look at the success that we're having in channels, a couple things are driving it. First is the execution that we're seeing in the stores and the merchandising that we're doing and the fact that we're winning down the aisle. It's the fact that we're increasing our points of distribution. We've seen significant success with the larger pack size that we've introduced. And clearly, that's been driving our share gains across all our major categories. In addition, we've taken the My Starbucks Rewards program and introduced that down the aisle as well, where in the quarter, we saw an 18% increase in the number of codes that were redeemed. And to date, we have over 20 million codes entered by over 2 million MSR customers in the CPG segment. So for us, we're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the category and in the segment, and we're very bullish on continuing to deliver that double-digit growth for the entire year as we look to finish out the year strong."

And I think one of the key pieces to that is all of the international opportunities that Kevin and John laid out. And so I think as you look in international CPG growth, particularly over the medium term, out a couple, 3 years, once the partnerships get up and running and we get product rolling off the lines, if those things go as well as we expected, there could be some upside there."

And the new Keurig agreement gives us an opportunity to extend agreement, number one, on very favorable terms. We have improved economics coming in, as Scott highlighted. But more importantly, we have greater operating flexibility in terms of being able to drive more innovation into the K-Cup category, additional SKUs and new packaging. And we also have the opportunity to now sell the K-Cups directly into office, into foodservice, college and universities, hotels and C-stores. So we're on track this year to do about 1.5 billion K-Cups, and we expect this category to push near the 20% growth rate for the entire year for us. So very optimistic on the opportunity that K-Cups has."

[Audio Gap] 
peak for those 300 busiest stores for example, mobile orders are already approaching 20% of transactions at those peak hours. So you're really seeing Mobile Order & Pay benefiting all customers. It's benefiting overall store performance in all these stores because of the incrementality and throughput unlocked. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay is allowing customers convenience so they can have that incremental visit, incremental occasion they wouldn't normally have time for, but it's also driving huge capacity unlock because of the program. You take 20% of transactions at peak out of the line, out of POS, you see the benefit at all stores, allow our customers to benefit from less people in line and allow our partners and customers to benefit from the fact that now our partners can concentrate more their energy on making food and beverage, on connecting with customers. And that's a big capacity and throughput unlock.

Spend per member is up across the board, and I know somebody is going to ask this question so let me try to get ahead of it here. We do obviously track all cohorts of people in our rewards program. And there are the people who are going to be better off by the new rules, there will be the majority of people who are more or less the same and a small minority of people who will earn rewards a little bit slower. All 3 of those cohorts are up in terms of spend so far. And we see absolutely no difference in the percentage among those 3 cohorts. So we are not seeing any of the noise that has been speculated on coming to bear. So very encouraging news there, and we'll be keeping a very close eye on it. And obviously, there's a lot of unlocked that comes with the new rewards program as well, too. It's enabling the Stars as currency initiatives because they're lowering the denomination of the Star. We have a lot of runway ahead with this, and we're very excited about what it will do in the long term."

And as Kevin has said earlier, the opportunity for Stars Everywhere in terms of ubiquity of people using that debit card and the only way they can bring back Stars in their rewards is Starbucks going to be a significant flywheel effect on our overall business. So we just wanted to be open with you about the complication and the degree of the significant change, but the long term is so beneficial to our customers and obviously to our shareholders."

We are focusing first and foremost on Europe because there's 25 million machines of Nespresso machines that are installed there. It's a very similar size right now in comparison to the number of installed base on Keurig here in the U.S. And we feel there's a significant opportunity to build this capsule business similar to the way we built the K-Cup business here in the U.S. And as Howard highlighted on his comments, single-serve represents 40% of the coffee consumed in home in Europe. And nearly 50% of our Starbucks customers have Nespresso machines in their homes. And so we see this as being a big opportunity. Beyond Europe, the big size of the prize is going to be in CAP and, more importantly, in China. And we are going to continue to look at how we expand the single-serve opportunity as the only truly leading global premium coffee brand in Asia across our store footprint and really go after this opportunity as well.

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016 when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all time all occurred within a single earnings period. 
In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first nonholiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income and operating performance well above our competitive set at it's very top of our sector. 
But I want to address right out of the gate the 2 questions you're likely asking yourselves: does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program?
On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly, and that we have a clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3 and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal '17 and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.
That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would have reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred. 
Very early in the quarter and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever, the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. The shift was a onetime event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit and would be more fair for all of our customers as well. 
In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased fee to service and reduced line attrition. Now given the sheer size, scale and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue. 
By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures as customers and partners adapted to the program changes.
What we've underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour and the 2 powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong positive interdependence and leverage. In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion a breathing room it needed. 
At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch. By [indiscernible] standards, our rewards results have been outstanding. We added nearly 2 million new members year-over-year, representing 18% growth and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide. 
We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up 3 full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from non-Rewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to a customers having joined the rewards program. 
These powerful metrics bode extremely well for a business going forward and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the rewards program. In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach.
What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall.  
But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through this as we always have. So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we and you are accustomed. And in this regard, we and I are Starbucks' harshest critics. 
But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then and following some slowing in Starbucks China business and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than 1 store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic, again demonstrating the strength, relevancy and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.
As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experience periods of slower growth in our U.S. business only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that followed. This is precisely the pattern I personally believe you're going to see as we head into fiscal '17 and beyond. 
Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits, with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of existing stores in the same trading area. This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.
A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our core proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization the very -- at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors. 
Our proprietary cold brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon day part. And Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout. And we are delighted to announce the opening of 2 new Starbucks Roasterys, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction. 
Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasterys will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro coffees around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world. In advance to plans to build 500-plus new-format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. 
And a new Roastery will -- in the new Roasterys, we'll be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with renowned Italian bakery and cafe operator  In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday. 
And I'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead. Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case. Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper end of our Q3 EPS target range despite less than expected sales life from our U.S. retail business goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. This quarter was an anomaly and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion. 
Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing, with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline. And execution across our 7 core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth. 
On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. I'll start with the Americas segment. 
Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company-operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year. This resulted in record Q3 revenues up 7% over prior year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal '16, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability and AUV sales. 
Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the onetime transition to the new rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing 2 points of comp; food contributing 1 point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing 1 point of comp each. 
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with the morning being our fastest-growing day-part. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and Espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year. 
We continue to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our cold brew coffee platform through the successful launch of Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Mocha Coconut Milk Macchiato and Starbucks' Nitro whole brew. n
Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by mango black, peach green and passion tango verbalized teas. 
Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomena. The drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation. 
Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages and we're off to a good start. Our food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, food grew 10% and contributed 1 point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, food is at a record 20% of total sales, and we actually saw an increase in attach. Our new power lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options. 
Let's now move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks Japan Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance, with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales and CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive but impacted by the recent earthquakes and the ongoing economic challenges in the country. 
Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China. Noteworthy is that despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our largest cities. 
The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continued to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed and we're on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal '19.
Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million [ph] Starbucks Reward members with over 10 million in China alone. We recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks store value cards lift to rewards. In Japan, we launched our first ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send details. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against the strategy to achieve and appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%. 
We opened 92 new stores in the quarter and we successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany through our licensed partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed. System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound and ongoing securities concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe. 
Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning day-part from Espresso bro and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea Lemonade, classic iced tea and iced tea lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We continue to rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results. 
Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollars share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted strong dollars share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full quota share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the #1 brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall and gained just under 1 full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth, driven by strength in sales from national customers and the office coffee channel.
Turning to ready-to-drink. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11% translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3 [ph] of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. 
And we're very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew ready-to-drink coffee launched just this month. Premium ready-to-drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past 5 years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales. 
In Q3, we announced our entry to this new category through a new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana ready-to-drink product line will offer consumers premium favor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana ready-to-drink teas will launch regionally in the first half of calendar year '17 and expand across the U.S. over time.
We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping ready-to-drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we're on track for a fall launch of the Starbucks Espresso compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with we are tracking to loss launch products in China by the end of calendar year '16. 
The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well. Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigated transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During a time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members. 
With strong retention across all customer segments, the vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions. Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than 1 year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payments in Starbucks. 
But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak. Adoption and usage continue to grow and the upside is significant as it is helping our customers and partners and our busiest stores at peak.
We continue to make progress on app improvements that include many functionality and response time while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next 3 months. Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through e-mail, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true real-time personalization capability, which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset with a clear innovation road map.
In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program, and our actions going forward are clear: drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold; enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization; and continue to execute against our 7 core strategies for growth. I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott?"
34745,311935478,1010108,"Starbucks Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results once again reflect strong revenue and profit growth, although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a nonh",1596,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results once again reflect strong revenue and profit growth, although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a nonholiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.
Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage and favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner in digital investments, primarily related to Americas segment. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3 and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49.
Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing license partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY '16. Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.
I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remains strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly 1 point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about 1 point. 
Store partner in digital investments increased in Q3, impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Including the -- included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award from tenured U.S. hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales.  Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year and an 80 basis points increase in operating margin to 23.8%. As a segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increase sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis points impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance, given our strong operating performance in the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations, driven by costs related to the sales of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.
Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by a favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi and leverage on cost of sales. 
Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development, with the full year 2016 in line with the segments Q3 year-to-date margin.
I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate because it came in lower than our expectation and gross. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter, and also the net gain from the Germany CEO, the majority of which was nontaxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis points impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability, which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit for most of these items will recur in Q4.
I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55, including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter. 
I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of the single week out of the year with complete precision, given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best. For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.89 -- $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, and we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance. 
On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. We now expect global comps growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels.
On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points and 1 point of negative impact from FX. For the full year, foreign exchange expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately 2 points.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee beans fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year and we are now over 50% price-locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.
Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest market such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 250 new media. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores.
We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago, we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily to fully vet and finalize our operating plan for the subsequent year.
As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter, characterized by very strong results from both China/Asia Pacific and Channel Development that challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less-than-expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar we cleared from Q3 of last year. That despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.
Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic operational and digital moves we outlined today and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect. 
We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats coming mobile, digital and loyalty innovation, new food and beverage offerings and many other initiatives underway at our biannual Investor Day on December 7. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with the sense of community and emotional attachment that I think over time, d",708,"Thank you for the question. Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with the sense of community and emotional attachment that I think over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to date is something different. And before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it. I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to rates. And I think the issues around Terra have created a level of anxiety. So we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that are faced -- that we are facing as citizens and I think the direction of the country. And so I think this is a multi-pronged issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks though, we at Starbucks look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place and affordable luxury and obviously the innovation that we have brought forth, gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers of the aspirational connection. And I think also it's very a long-winded answer but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand, which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described. In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience. I think that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described. And we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance, but as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it. But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that is -- has been done before. This is quite unusual, it's unsettling, it's unnerving. And as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before. But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity, the brand, then innovation with Kevin has described in the digital, all these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia and specifically China, which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day, and I've said this in the past, will be as large or larger than the U.S. And as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at the China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity, the brand, the experience that those people haven't seen it. It's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there and we are just getting started. When that Shanghai Roastery reopens, it is going to be something that is going to probably be as strong and experienced as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai. That's a very long-winded answer. And the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described."

And then David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the rewards program, the digital flywheel, I'll give you 3 dimensions, which I think we are having an opportunity to leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan, in China as examples. And the more we take the rewards program and the mobile app and our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the rewards program. And Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepened the engagement with existing customers in the rewards program. And that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization. And it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay. Statistically, when we looked at once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay, once it's a very sticky feature, once they try, once they start using it regularly, the vast majority of them do. So those are 3 dimensions.

As you know, the past program only rewarded frequency. We couldn't reward any other behavior above that. We now have the opportunity both in e-mail, which we've just begun and this quarter in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them. In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend. So connecting the dots there, you can see how this will build on itself and give us leverage to drive the total customer sales."

If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint, and at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand. What we saw this past quarter, and for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in a business of buying business. We don't want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know our core purpose is and we've got played to the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of experience, the quality of the coffee. What we keep talking about really internally is we want to the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiere position of Starbucks is linked to the Roasterys and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar '17, which is Starbucks Reserve, which in a way is like a cousin in a slower format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting. And we're not going to get in that game despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us."

As I look at volume, I'd say our volume growth was a little bit higher than that but not much. And I think the combination of our base and promoted pricing had been able to deliver about the kind of margin expansion we want to see as well as the share improvements that we would see. As we move forward to the fourth quarter, we feel very good about the innovation that we have coming. We've got our cold brew that is coming in our ready-to-serve segment. We also have our new Caffè Latte launched in our K-Cup format that is going to be launched in the fourth quarter. Then on a global basis, we have a lot of new initiatives that are coming, particularly in the ready-to-drink and single-serve segments with an Espresso launch in EMEA. So we feel good about the quality of our growth in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we also feel good about as well, and I'll let Scott take the margin expansion question."

It won't be 710 basis points vary many quarters, this was unusual and excellent. But we do expect channel operating income to grow faster than revenue growth, and that will drive margin expansion as we move into '17."

I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season. Now in many ways, the rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described. So the launch of rewards required significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams. And this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on rewards program so they could explain it and educate customers and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers
[Audio Gap]
last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one. Second and related was the implication of having 2 major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. We've -- over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon in some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with a negative one comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around rewards and communicated. And unfortunately having 2 major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz and that translated into not as many transactions. So launching it a week later and then having 2 marketing messages simultaneously really contributors. And then I potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment. Given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of the world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened. Now industry-specific spending data for retail broadly and for restaurant specifically would support that, that's the case. We've navigated these situations in the past, and I think as Howard articulated, this one may be a bit different. But we think when we put these 3 factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, you want to add something?"

I think one of the things just to show a change is always difficult for both partners and customers, the frequency we have people coming into our stores and the relationship between the barista and the customer is absolutely key to our business. So we invested a lot of funds in making our partners ready for the change. Good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition. Functionality is great and growing and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program. And the existing customers about the benefits and personalization really helped with that and then continue to grow the number of members in the program. I think Mobile Order & Pay tied nicely into that. And as Kevin -- as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members are 18%, taking us to 12.3 million just gives us great confidence for the future."

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016 when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all time, all occurred within a single earnings period. 
In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first nonholiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income and operating performance well above our competitive set and it's very top of our sector.
But I want to address right out of the gate the 2 questions you're likely asking yourselves: does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program?
On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly and that we have a clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3, and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments, as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal '17 and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.
That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would've reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred.
Very early in the quarter and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever: the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. This shift was a onetime event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit and would be more fair for all of our customers as well.
In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased fee to service and reduced line attrition. Now given the sheer size, scale and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue. 
By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures, as customers and partners adapted to the program changes.
What we underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour and that 2 powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong positive interdependence and leverage. In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion a breathing room it needed.
At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch. By any [indiscernible] of standards, our rewards results have been outstanding. We added net nearly 2 million new members year-over-year representing 18% growth and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide.
We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up 3 full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from non-rewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to our customers having joined the rewards program.
These powerful metrics bode extremely well for a business going forward and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the rewards program. In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach.
What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall.  But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through this as we always have. So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we and you are accustomed. And in this regard, we and I are Starbucks' harshest critics.
But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then and following some slowing in Starbucks China business and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than 1 store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic, again demonstrating the strength, relevancy and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.
As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experienced periods of slower growth in our U.S. business, only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that followed. This is precisely the pattern, I personally believe, you're going to see as we head into fiscal '17 and beyond.
Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of visiting stores in the same trading area. This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.
A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our core proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization the very -- at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors.
Our proprietary Cold Brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon day-part. And Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout. And we are delighted to announce the opening of 2 new Starbucks Roasterys, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction.
Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasterys will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world, in advance to our plans to build 500-plus new-format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. 
And a new Roastery will be of -- in the new Roasterys, we'll be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with renowned Italian bakery and cafe operator, Princi. In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday.
And I'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead. Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case. Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper end of our Q3 EPS target range despite less than expected sales from our U.S. retail business goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. This quarter was an anomaly and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion.
Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline. And execution across our 7 core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth.
On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. I'll start with the Americas segment.
Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company-operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year. This resulted in record Q3 revenues, up 7% over prior year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal '16, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability and AUV sales.
Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the onetime transition to the new rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing 2 points of comp; food contributing 1 point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing 1 point of comp each.
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with the morning being our fastest-growing day-part. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and Espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year.
We continue to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our cold brew coffee platform through the successful launch of Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Mocha Coconut Milk Macchiato and Starbucks' Nitro Cold Brew. 
Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by mango black, peach green and Passion Tango Herbal Iced tea.
Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomena. The pink drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation.
Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages, and we're off to a good start. Our food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, food grew 10% and contributed 1 point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, food is at a record 20% of total sales, and we actually saw an increase in attach. Our new Power Lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options.
Let's now move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance, with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales and CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive, but impacted by the recent earthquakes and the ongoing economic challenges in the country.
Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China. Noteworthy is that despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our larger cities.
The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed and we're on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal '19.
Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million Starbucks Reward members, with over 10 million in China alone. We've recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks store value cards linked to rewards. In Japan, we launched our first ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send details. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against the strategy to achieve an appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly, while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%.
We opened 92 new stores in the quarter, and we successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany through our licensed partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed. System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound and ongoing security concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe.
Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning day-part from Espresso Roast and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea, Lemonade, classic iced tea and iced tea lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We'll continue the global rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results.
Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollars share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted strong dollars share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full quota share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the #1 brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Starbucks Roast and Ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall and gained just under 1 full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth driven by strength in sales from national customers and the office coffee channel.
Turning to ready-to-drink. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11% translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3 of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. 
And we're very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew ready-to-drink coffee launched just this month. Premium ready-to-drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past 5 years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales. 
In Q3, we announced our entry into this new category through new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana ready-to-drink product line will offer consumers premium flavor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana ready-to-drink teas, we'll launch regionally in the first half of calendar year '17 and expand across the U.S. over time.
We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping ready-to-drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we're on track for a fall launch of the Starbucks Espresso compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with Tingyi, we are tracking to launch ready-to-drink products in China by the end of calendar year '16.
The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well. Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigated transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During the time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members, 
with strong retention across all customer segments. The vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions. 
Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than 1 year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payments in Starbucks.  But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak. Adoption and usage continue to grow and the upside is significant as it is helping our customers and partners and our busiest stores at peak.
We continue to make progress on app improvements that include many functionality and response time, while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next 3 months. Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through e-mail, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true real-time personalization capability which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset with a clear innovation road map.
In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program, and our actions going forward are clear: drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold; enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization; and continue to execute against our 7 core strategies for growth. 
I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott?"
34745,311935478,1010221,"Starbucks Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a no",1597,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a nonholiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.
Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage in favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner in digital investments, primarily related to our Americas segment. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3, and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49.
Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain, resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing license partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY '16.
 Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.
I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remained strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly 1 point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about 1 point.
Store partner in digital investments increased in Q3 impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Including that -- included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award for tenured U.S. retail hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales. Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating income in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year and an 80 basis points increase in operating margin to 23.8% as the segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increased sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance given our strong operating performance in the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations driven by costs related to the sales of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.
Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi and leverage on cost of sales.
Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to-date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development, with the full year 2016 in line with the segments Q3 year-to-date margin.
I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate because it came in lower than our expectation and yours. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter and also the net gain from the Germany sale, the majority of which was nontaxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis point impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit for most of these items will recur in Q4.
I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55, including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter.
I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of the single week out of the year with complete precision given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best. For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.89 -- $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week. And we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance.
On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels.
On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points and 1 point of negative impact from FX. For the full year, foreign exchange expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately 2 points.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price-locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.
Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 250 in EMEA. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores.
We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago, we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily to fully vet and finalize our annual operating plan for the subsequent year.
As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter characterized by very strong results from both China/Asia Pacific and Channel Development that challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less-than-expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar we cleared from Q3 of last year. Despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.
Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic operational and digital moves we outlined today and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect.
We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats coming mobile, digital and loyalty innovation, new food and beverage offerings and many other initiatives underway at our biannual Investor Day on December 7.

Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time",716,"Thank you for the question. Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to date is something different. And well, before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it. I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that are faced -- that we are facing as citizens and I think the direction of the country. And so I think this is a multi-pronged issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks though, we, at Starbucks, look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place and affordable luxury and obviously, the innovation that we have brought forth, gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers the aspirational connection. And I think also it's very -- I know this is a long-winded answer, but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand, which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described. In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience, I think, that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described. And we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance, but as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it. But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that is -- has been done before. This is quite unusual, it's unsettling, it's unnerving, and as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before. But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity, the brand, the innovation, what Kevin has described in that digital, all these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia and specifically China, which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day, and I've said this in the past, will be as large or larger than the U.S., and as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at that China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity, the brand, the experience, for those people who haven't seen it, it's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there and we are just getting started. When that Shanghai Roastery opens, it is going to be something that is going to probably be as strong and experienced as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai. That's a very long-winded answer. And the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described."

And then, David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the rewards program, the digital flywheel, I'll give you 3 dimensions in which I think we are -- have an opportunity to better leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan, in China, as examples. The more we take the rewards program and the mobile app and our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the rewards program. And Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity, and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepen the engagement with the existing customers in the rewards program. And that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization. And it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay, and statistically, when we look at once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay, once it's a very sticky feature, they -- once they try it once, they start using it regularly. The vast majority of them do. So those are 3 dimensions. And I'm going to hand over to Matt Ryan to talk a little bit more about the personalization work we're doing. But those are 3 dimensions that we are going to use to leverage that asset. And Matt, to you, on personalization."

I think the one thing I would add here is there's a direct linkage between the changes we made in our rewards program and our ability to launch personalization moving forward. As you know, the past program only rewarded frequency. We couldn't reward any other behavior but that. We now have the opportunity both in e-mail, which we've just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them. In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend. So connecting the dots there, you can see how this will build on itself and give us leverage to drive the total customer sales."

If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique, and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint and at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand. What we saw this past quarter, and for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in the business of buying business. We do not want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know what our core purpose is. And we've got to play the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of the experience, the quality, the coffee. What we keep talking about really internally is we want to take the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiumization of Starbucks is linked to the Roasterys and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar '17, which is Starbucks Reserve, which in a way is like a cousin in a smaller format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine a halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting. And we're not going to get in that game despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us."

I think Kevin is going to take the bulk of the question. But I think ask yourself rhetorically, with 25 consecutive quarters of 5% or greater, if we did not have the confluence of the rewards program and the Frappuccino launch at the same time, what would comps have been for this quarter. And I can tell you unequivocally that we know internally that this was an anomaly as a result of what I described in my prepared remarks. Now we've known that from an execution standpoint because we underestimated what would take place. But if any of that did not exist, the comps in the quarter would not have been the 4% that we have outlined in the release. And I think as a result of that, we feel very comfortable that things are going to improve. Kevin?"

I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season. Now in many ways, the rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described. So the launch of rewards required a significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams. And this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on the rewards program so they could explain it and educate customers and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers, we delayed our normal Summer 1 campaign launch by 1 week. So we launched it 1 week later than we did last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one. Second and related was the implication of having 2 major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour, running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. We've -- over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon in some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with the negative 1 comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around rewards and communicate it. And unfortunately, having 2 major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz, and that translated into not as many transactions. So launching it a week later and then having 2 marketing messages simultaneously were the contributors. And then I think the potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment, given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of the world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened. Now industry-specific spending data for retail broadly and for restaurant specifically would support that that's the case. And we've navigated these situations in the past, and I think as Howard articulated, this one maybe be a bit different. But we think when we put these 3 factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, you want to add something?"

I think one of the things just to show a change is always difficult for both partners and customers, the frequency we have people coming into our stores and the relationship between the barista and the customer is absolutely key to our business. So we invested a lot of funds in making our partners ready for the change. The good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition. Functionality is great and growing, and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program with existing customers about the benefits, and the personalization really helped with that, and then continue to grow the number of members in the program. I think Mobile Order & Pay ties nicely in with that. And as Kevin --sorry, as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members are 18%, taking us to 12.3 million. It just gives us great confidence for the future."

And so later this quarter, we'll get favorites of stores which will make people -- make it easier for people in New York and other dense areas to select and save favorite stores, favorite orders, makes it easier to save favorite orders.

And as we get into '17, to the second part of your question, and Matt touched on this, we will further refine our personalization capability to have suggested selling 1:1 as you're building your order with relevant products based upon what you've ordered in the past, day-part, your preferences.

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016 when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all time, all occurred within a single earnings period. 
In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first non-holiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income and operating performance well above our competitive set and at the very top of our sector.
But I want to address right out of the gate the 2 questions you're likely asking yourselves: does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program?
On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly and that we have a clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3, and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments, as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal '17 and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.
That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would have reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred.
Very early in the quarter and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever: the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. This shift was a onetime event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit and would be more fair for all of our customers as well.
In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased speed of service and reduced line attrition. Now given the sheer size, scale and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue. 
By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures, as customers and partners adapted to the program changes.
What we underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour and that 2 powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong positive interdependence and leverage. In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion a breathing room it needed.
At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch. By anyone else's standards, our rewards results have been outstanding. We added nearly 2 million new members year-over-year representing 18% growth and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide.
We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up 3 full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from non-rewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to our customers having joined the rewards program.
These powerful metrics bode extremely well for our business going forward and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the rewards program. In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach.
What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall.  But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through them as we always have. So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we and you are accustomed. And in this regard, we and I are Starbucks' harshest critics.
But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then and following some slowing in Starbucks China business and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than 1 store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic, again demonstrating the strength, relevancy and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.
As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experienced periods of slower growth in our U.S. business, only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that followed. This is precisely the pattern I personally believe you are going to see as we head into fiscal '17 and beyond.
Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of existing stores in the same trading area. This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.
A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our cold proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization the very -- at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors.
Our proprietary Cold Brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon day-part. And Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout. And we are delighted to announce the opening of 2 new Starbucks Roasterys, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction.
Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasterys will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world, in advance of our plans to build 500-plus new-format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. 
In the new Roastery we will be of -- in the new Roasterys we'll be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with renowned Italian bakery and cafe operator, Princi. In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday.
And I'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead. Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case. Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper end of our Q3 EPS target range despite less than expected sales lift from our U.S. retail business goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world.

These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. This quarter was an anomaly and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion.
Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline. And execution across our 7 core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth.
On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. I'll start with the Americas segment.
Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company-operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year. This resulted in record Q3 revenues, up 7% over prior year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal '16, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability and AUV sales.
Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the onetime transition to the new rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing 2 points of comp; food contributing 1 point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing 1 point of comp each.
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with the morning being our fastest-growing day-part. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and Espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year.
We continue to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our cold brew coffee platform through the successful launch of Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Mocha Coconut Milk Macchiato and Starbucks' Nitro Cold Brew. 
Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by Mango Black, Peach Green and Passion Tango Herbal Iced teas.
Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomena. The pink drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation.
Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages, and we're off to a good start. Our food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, food grew 10% and contributed 1 point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, food is at a record 20% of total sales, and we actually saw an increase in attach. Our new Power Lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options.
Let's now move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance, with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales and CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive, but impacted by the recent earthquakes and the ongoing economic challenges in the country.
Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China. Noteworthy is that despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our largest cities.
The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed and we are on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal '19.
Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million Starbucks Reward members, with over 10 million in China alone. We've recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks store value cards linked to rewards. In Japan, we launched our first ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send e-gifts. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against the strategy to achieve an appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly, while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%.
We opened 92 new stores in the quarter, and we successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany to our license partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed. System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound and ongoing security concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe.
Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning day-part from Espresso growth and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea, Lemonade, classic iced tea and iced tea lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We'll continue the global rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results.
Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollars share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted strong dollars share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full point of share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the #1 brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Starbucks Roast and Ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall and gained just under 1 full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth driven by strength in sales from national customers and the office coffee channel.
Turning to ready-to-drink. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11% translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3% of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. 
And we're very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew ready-to-drink coffee launched just this month. Premium ready-to-drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past 5 years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales. 
In Q3, we announced our entry into this new category through new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana ready-to-drink product line will offer consumers premium flavor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana ready-to-drink teas will launch regionally in the first half of calendar year '17 and expand across the U.S. over time.
We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping ready-to-drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we are on track for a fall launch of the Starbucks Espresso compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with Tingyi, we are tracking to launch ready-to-drink products in China by the end of calendar year '16.
The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well. Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigated transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During the time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members, 
with strong retention across all customer segments. The vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions. 
Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than 1 year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payment at Starbucks.  But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak. Adoption and usage continue to grow and the upside is significant as it is helping our customers and partners and our busiest stores at peak.
We continue to make progress on app improvements that include menu functionality and response time, while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next 3 months. Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through email, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true real-time personalization capability which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset with a clear innovation road map.
In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program, and our actions going forward are clear: drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold; enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization; and continue to execute against our 7 core strategies for growth. 
I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott?"
34745,311935478,1010350,"Starbucks Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a no",1603,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a non-holiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.
Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage and favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner in digital investments, primarily related to our Americas segment. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3, and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49.
Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain, resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing license partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY '16.
Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.
I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remained strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly 1 point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about 1 point.
Store partner in digital investments increased in Q3 impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Including that -- included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award for tenured U.S. retail hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales. Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating income in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year and an 80 basis points increase in operating margin to 23.8% as the segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increased sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance given our strong operating performance in the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations driven by costs related to the sales of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.
Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi and leverage on cost of sales.
Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to-date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development, with the full year 2016 in line with the segment's Q3 year-to-date margin.
I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate because it came in lower than our expectation and yours. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter and also the net gain from the Germany sale, the majority of which was nontaxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis point impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit for most of these items will recur in Q4.
I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55, including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter.
I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of the single week out of the year with complete precision given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best. For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.89 -- $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week. And we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance.
On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels.
On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points and 1 point of negative impact from FX. For the full year, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately 2 points.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price-locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.
Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 250 in EMEA. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores.
We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago, we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily (sic) [ necessary ] to fully vet and finalize our annual operating plan for the subsequent year.
As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter characterized by very strong results from both China/Asia Pacific and Channel Development that challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less-than-expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar to clear from Q3 of last year. Yet despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.
Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic, operational and digital moves we outlined today and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect.
We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats, coming mobile, digital and loyalty innovation, new food and beverage offerings and many other initiatives underway at our biennial Investor Day on December 7.

Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time",715,"Thank you for the question. Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to date is something different. And before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it. I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that are faced -- that we are facing as citizens and I think the direction of the country. And so I think this is a multi-pronged issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks though, we, at Starbucks, look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury and obviously, the innovation that we have brought forth, gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers the aspirational connection. And I think also it's very -- I know this is a long-winded answer, but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand, which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described. In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience, I think, that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described. And we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance, but as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it. But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that is -- has been done before. This is quite unusual, it's unsettling, it's unnerving, and as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before. But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity, the brand, the innovation, what Kevin has described in that digital, all these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia and, specifically, China which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day, and I've said this in the past, will be as large or larger than the U.S., and as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at that China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity, the brand, the experience, for those people who haven't seen it, it's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there and we are just getting started. When that Shanghai Roastery opens, it is going to be something that is going to probably be as strong an experience as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai. That's a very long-winded answer. And the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described."

And then, David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the rewards program and the digital flywheel. I'll give you 3 dimensions in which I think we are -- have an opportunity to better leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan, in China, as examples. The more we take the rewards program and the mobile app and our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the rewards program. And Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity, and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepen the engagement with the existing customers in the rewards program. And that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization. And it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay, and statistically, when we look at once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay, once it's a very sticky feature, they -- once they try it once, they start using it regularly. The vast majority of them do. So those are 3 dimensions. And I'm going to hand over to Matt Ryan to talk a little bit more about the personalization work we're doing. But those are 3 dimensions that we are going to use to leverage that asset. And Matt, to you, on personalization."

We now have the opportunity both in e-mail, which we've just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them. In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend.

If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique, and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint and at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand. What we saw this past quarter, and for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in the business of buying business. We do not want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know what our core purpose is. And we've got to play the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of the experience, the quality, the coffee. What we keep talking about really internally is we want to take the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiumization of Starbucks is linked to the Roasterys and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar '17, which is Starbucks Reserve, which in a way is like a cousin in a smaller format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine a halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting it. And we're not going to get in that game despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us."

I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what",543,"Yes, let me build on that, Joe. I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season. Now in many ways, the rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described. So the launch of rewards required a significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams. And this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on the rewards program so they could explain it and educate customers and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers, we delayed our normal Summer 1 campaign launch by 1 week. So we launched it 1 week later than we did last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one. Second and related was the implication of having 2 major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour, running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. We've -- over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon in some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with the negative 1% comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around rewards and communicate it. And unfortunately, having 2 major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz, and that translated into not as many transactions. So launching it a week later and then having 2 marketing messages simultaneously were the contributors. And then I think the potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment, given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of the world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened. Now industry-specific spending data for retail broadly and for restaurant specifically would support that that's the case. And we've navigated these situations in the past, and I think as Howard articulated, this one may be a bit different. But we think when we put these 3 factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, you want to add something?"

So we invested a lot of funds in making our partners ready for the change. The good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition. Functionality is great and growing, and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program with existing customers about the benefits, and the personalization will really help with that, and then continue to grow the number of members in the program. I think Mobile Order & Pay ties nicely in with that. And as Kevin --sorry, as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members are 18%, taking us to 12.3 million. It just gives us great confidence for the future."

And we're just starting to ship into new markets and to new channels within the region this quarter. And then within China/Asia Pacific, Japan and China being our key markets, we have key partnerships in Japan, which is our biggest market, with Suntory, in Korea with Dongseo Foods. And then as we've talked, we have a partnership with Tingyi in China where we are in the final phases of scaling up both the distribution and manufacturing so that we'll be in the market by the end of this year.

Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016 when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all time, all occurred within a single earnings period. 
In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first nonholiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income and operating performance well above our competitive set and at the very top of our sector.
But I want to address right out of the gate the 2 questions you're likely asking yourselves: does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program?
On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly and that we have a clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3, and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments, as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal '17 and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.
That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would have reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred.
Very early in the quarter and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever: the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. This shift was a onetime event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit and would be more fair for all of our customers as well.
In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased speed of service and reduced line attrition. Now given the sheer size, scale and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue. 
By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures, as customers and partners adapted to the program changes.
What we underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour and that 2 powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong positive interdependence and leverage. In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion a breathing room it needed.
At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch. By anyone else's standards, our rewards results have been outstanding. We added nearly 2 million new members year-over-year representing 18% growth and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide.
We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up 3 full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from nonrewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to our customers having joined the rewards program.
These powerful metrics bode extremely well for our business going forward and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the rewards program. In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach.
What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall. But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through them as we always have. So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we and you are accustomed. And in this regard, we and I are Starbucks' harshest critics.
But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then and following some slowing in Starbucks China business and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than 1 store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic, again demonstrating the strength, relevancy and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.
As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experienced periods of slower growth in our U.S. business, only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that followed. This is precisely the pattern I personally believe you are going to see as we head into fiscal '17 and beyond.
Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of existing stores in the same trading area. This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.
A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our cold proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization the very -- at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors.
Our proprietary Cold Brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon day-part. And Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout. And we are delighted to announce the opening of 2 new Starbucks Roasterys, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction.
Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasterys will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world, in advance of our plans to build 500-plus new-format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. 
In the new Roastery we will be of -- in the new Roasterys we'll be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with renowned Italian bakery and cafe operator, Princi. In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday.
And I'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead. Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case. Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper end of our Q3 EPS target range despite less-than-expected sales lift from our U.S. retail business goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

This quarter was an anomaly and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion.
Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline. And execution across our 7 core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth.
On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. I'll start with the Americas segment.
Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company-operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year. This resulted in record Q3 revenues, up 7% over prior year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal '16, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability and AUV sales.
Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the onetime transition to the new rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing 2 points of comp; food contributing 1 point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing 1 point of comp each.
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with the morning being our fastest-growing day-part. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and Espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year.
We continue to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our cold brew coffee platform through the successful launch of Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Mocha Coconut Milk Macchiato and Starbucks' Nitro Cold Brew. 
Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by Mango Black, Peach Green and Passion Tango Herbal Iced teas.
Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomena. The pink drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation.
Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages, and we're off to a good start. Our food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, food grew 10% and contributed 1 point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, food is at a record 20% of total sales, and we actually saw an increase in attach. Our new Power Lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options.
Let's now move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance, with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales and CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive, but impacted by the recent earthquakes and the ongoing economic challenges in the country.
Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China. Noteworthy is that despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our largest cities.
The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed and we are on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal '19.
Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million Starbucks Reward members, with over 10 million in China alone. We've recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks store value cards linked to rewards. In Japan, we launched our first ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send e-gifts. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against the strategy to achieve an appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly, while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%.
We opened 92 new stores in the quarter, and we successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany to our license partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed. System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound and ongoing security concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe.
Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning day-part from Espresso growth and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea, Lemonade, classic iced tea and iced tea lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We'll continue the global rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results.
Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollars share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted strong dollars share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full point of share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the #1 brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Starbucks Roast and Ground continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall and gained just under 1 full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth driven by strength in sales from national customers and the office coffee channel.
Turning to ready-to-drink. Our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11% translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3% of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. 
And we're very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew ready-to-drink coffee launched just this month. Premium ready-to-drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past 5 years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales. 
In Q3, we announced our entry into this new category through new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana ready-to-drink product line will offer consumers premium flavor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana ready-to-drink teas will launch regionally in the first half of calendar year '17 and expand across the U.S. over time.
We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping ready-to-drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we are on track for a fall launch of the Starbucks Espresso compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with Tingyi, we are tracking to launch ready-to-drink products in China by the end of calendar year '16.
The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well. Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigated transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During the time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members, 
with strong retention across all customer segments. The vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions. 
Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than 1 year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payment at Starbucks. But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak. Adoption and usage continue to grow and the upside is significant as it is helping our customers and partners and our busiest stores at peak.
We continue to make progress on app improvements that include menu functionality and response time, while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next 3 months. Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through email, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true real-time personalization capability which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset with a clear innovation road map.
In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program, and our actions going forward are clear: drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold; enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization; and continue to execute against our 7 core strategies for growth. 
I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott?"
34745,311935478,1011005,"Starbucks Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a no",1603,"Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflects strong revenue and profit growth although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a nonholiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.
Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage and favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner in digital investments, primarily related to our Americas segment. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3, and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49.
Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain, resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing license partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY '16.
Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.
I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remained strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly 1 point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about 1 point.
Store partner in digital investments increased in Q3 impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Including that -- included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award for tenured U.S. retail hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales. Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.
Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating income in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year and an 80 basis points increase in operating margin to 23.8% as the segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increased sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance given our strong operating performance in the region.
Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations driven by costs related to the sales of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.
Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi and leverage on cost of sales.
Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to-date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development, with the full year 2016 in line with the segment's Q3 year-to-date margin.
I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate because it came in lower than our expectation and yours. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter and also the net gain from the Germany sale, the majority of which was nontaxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis point impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit for most of these items will recur in Q4.
I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55, including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter.
I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of the single week out of the year with complete precision given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best. For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.89 -- $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week. And we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance.
On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels.
On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points and 1 point of negative impact from FX. For the full year, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately 2 points.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.
Moving on to commodities. With 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price-locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.
Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific and 250 in EMEA. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores.
We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.
Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago, we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily (sic) [ necessary ] to fully vet and finalize our annual operating plan for the subsequent year.
As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter characterized by very strong results from both China/Asia Pacific and Channel Development that challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less-than-expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar to clear from Q3 of last year. Yet despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.
Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic, operational and digital moves we outlined today and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect.
We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats, coming mobile, digital and loyalty innovation, new food and beverage offerings and many other initiatives underway at our biennial Investor Day on December 7.

Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time",715,"Thank you for the question. Let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that, I think, over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to date is something different. And before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it. I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that are faced -- that we are facing as citizens and I think the direction of the country. And so I think this is a multi-pronged issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks though, we, at Starbucks, look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury and obviously, the innovation that we have brought forth, gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers the aspirational connection. And I think also it's very -- I know this is a long-winded answer, but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand, which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described. In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience, I think, that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described. And we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance, but as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it. But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that is -- has been done before. This is quite unusual, it's unsettling, it's unnerving, and as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before. But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity, the brand, the innovation, what Kevin has described in that digital, all these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia and, specifically, China which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day, and I've said this in the past, will be as large or larger than the U.S., and as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at that China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity, the brand, the experience, for those people who haven't seen it, it's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there and we are just getting started. When that Shanghai Roastery opens, it is going to be something that is going to probably be as strong an experience as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai. That's a very long-winded answer. And the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described."

So what we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice, whether we go back to the late '80s with Bean Stock and health care, what we've done in the last couple of years with college achievement and now we're doing now on wages, we want to try and do everything we can to share success because we know that the brand of Starbucks is directly related to the experience in our stores.

And then, David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the rewards program and the digital flywheel. I'll give you 3 dimensions in which I think we are -- have an opportunity to better leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan, in China, as examples. The more we take the rewards program and the mobile app and our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the rewards program. And Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity, and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepen the engagement with the existing customers in the rewards program. And that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization. And it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay, and statistically, when we look at once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay, once it's a very sticky feature, they -- once they try it once, they start using it regularly. The vast majority of them do. So those are 3 dimensions. And I'm going to hand over to Matt Ryan to talk a little bit more about the personalization work we're doing. But those are 3 dimensions that we are going to use to leverage that asset. And Matt, to you, on personalization."

We now have the opportunity both in e-mail, which we've just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them. In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend.

If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique, and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint and at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand. What we saw this past quarter, and for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in the business of buying business. We do not want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know what our core purpose is. And we've got to play the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of the experience, the quality, the coffee. What we keep talking about really internally is we want to take the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiumization of Starbucks is linked to the Roasterys and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar '17, which is Starbucks Reserve, which in a way is like a cousin in a smaller format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine a halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting it. And we're not going to get in that game despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us."

So as you look at the things that Matt talked about, the ability to drive personalization, we see an additional opportunity there. So I don't think we're in the early innings, but it will probably continue for a number of years as we continue to drive digital innovation, we continue to drive the right level of investment in stores and partners.

I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what",543,"Yes, let me build on that, Joe. I think there's 3 primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season. Now in many ways, the rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described. So the launch of rewards required a significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams. And this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on the rewards program so they could explain it and educate customers and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers, we delayed our normal Summer 1 campaign launch by 1 week. So we launched it 1 week later than we did last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one. Second and related was the implication of having 2 major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour, running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. We've -- over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon in some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with the negative 1% comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around rewards and communicate it. And unfortunately, having 2 major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz, and that translated into not as many transactions. So launching it a week later and then having 2 marketing messages simultaneously were the contributors. And then I think the potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment, given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of the world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened. Now industry-specific spending data for retail broadly and for restaurant specifically would support that that's the case. And we've navigated these situations in the past, and I think as Howard articulated, this one may be a bit different. But we think when we put these 3 factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, you want to add something?"

Joe, it's Cliff. I think one of the things just to share, change is always difficult for both partners and customers, the frequency we have people coming into our stores and the relationship between the barista and the customer is absolutely key to our business. So we invested a lot of funds in making our partners ready for the change. The good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition. Functionality is great and growing, and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program with existing customers about the benefits, and the personalization will really help with that, and then continue to grow the number of members in the program. I think Mobile Order & Pay ties nicely in with that. And as Kevin --sorry, as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members are 18%, taking us to 12.3 million. It just gives us great confidence for the future."

As you know, we look at it by product, we look at it by geography, and we're very careful to be sensitive to significant changes to customer impact. We're really cognizant of that. And as we've done that over the years, including this year and the most recent pricing changes that we just made, we are not seeing any change in customer attrition. So that's not happening. 
And then to your core question, as you know, over the last few years, we've had 1 to 2 points of price in our comps every quarter. This quarter, the third quarter will fall into that 1- to 2-point price range. And the fourth quarter will fall into that 1- to 2-point price range. So there's no acceleration of comp pricing in the guidance that I gave."

We obviously don't anticipate another negative 1% comp from blended. In addition, as we look at the Summer 2 platform that Kevin talked about, with things like Iced Coconut Milk Macchiato and Mocha Macchiato, and the early results from that are quite encouraging, we've got a number of things on the product lineup card, Nitro Cold Brew as well as acceleration of some of the features within Mobile Order & Pay. And so later this quarter, we'll get favorites of stores which will make people -- make it easier for people in New York and other dense areas to select and save favorite stores, favorite orders, makes it easier to save favorite orders. And when we will look at our, broadly, our innovation pipeline digital product, things that we're doing in the stores with things like Nitro marketing, there's just a significant amount of momentum already. And then -- that we have planned as we look forward. And as we get into '17, to the second part of your question, and Matt touched on this, we will further refine our personalization capability to have suggestive selling 1:1 as you're building your order with relevant products based upon what you've ordered in the past, day-part, your preferences. So all of that is stacked up, and that's what makes us think we can get to 5%, at least, as we get into Q4 and try to accelerate as we go into 2017."

In Latin America, we just signed a deal with PepsiCo last year to strengthen our business within that region. And we're just starting to ship into new markets and to new channels within the region this quarter. And then within China/Asia Pacific, Japan and China being our key markets, we have key partnerships in Japan, which is our biggest market, with Suntory, in Korea with Dongseo Foods. And then as we've talked, we have a partnership with Tingyi in China where we are in the final phases of scaling up both the distribution and manufacturing so that we'll be in the market by the end of this year.

As a further reminder, non-GAAP earnings also continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. Please refer to the reconciliation table at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
This conference call will also include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

Wonderful to have you, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results highlighted by an 11% increase in global revenues, a 17% increase in non-GAAP EPS and record operating margins despite persistent economic, consumer and geopolitical headwinds and the significant investments we continue to make in our people and our business and once again demonstrating the power, relevance and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand.
Today, Starbucks is delivering an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to over 85 million customers through our 25,000 stores in 75 countries every week. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is propelling our business forward in markets and channels around the world as never before. 
But our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee. The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation to the next wave of growth in our business starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme. 
On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. Then Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets. 
Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just 2 weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable. These stores of any stores in the world and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016. 
There are countless examples over the last decade of Western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.
Now as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over store day a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.
We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I'm convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.
These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roastery is defined [ph] coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks Coffee authority and retail express. And the portfolio of Roasterys we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.
Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning 2-level 30,000 square foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-sensory experience, emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers. 
Starbucks' business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle-class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. 
And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasterys in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first Roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017. 
Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasterys is supported by the one-of-a-kind ultra-premium reserve experience our Roasterys deliver to our customers and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery. We're fully -- where full year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be 4x the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.
Nitro, for example, an innovative new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too is Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso as well as handcrafted proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.
As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasterys will serve as the foundation for the exciting new format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores. Also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. 
The first of these new format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year. And we are expanding [ph] elements of the high-end Roastery experience to include reserve Espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customer response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging as customers are trading up to premium Espresso beverages. 
Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long term is what drives the results we deliver quarter-to-quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. 
Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week, a company paid --  are given a company-paid 4-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.
Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and 4x the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population. The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making 2 years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success but also from the perspective of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareholders, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry.
We demonstrated this again in Q4 and fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance. 11% top line and 17% bottom line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly. 
A few final thoughts before handling the call over to Kevin. Since its opening 2 years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. 
We knew from the start that the Roastery will introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery will support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world. 
But what we are achieving is much more than that. It's innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at -- at once, a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience like reserve bars that, over the next few years, will incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores. 
Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity, over time, for 20 to 30 Roasterys in influential cities around the world to finding the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability and drive incrementality through new premium locations we currently do not capture.
I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all points the next wave of growth for our company. 
In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. And it's why Roasterys, reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success. The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. 
But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China, or for that matter, Seattle where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with reserve bars at 10 Waverley Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. 
Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

In fiscal year '16, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%, and we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. 
We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasterys, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China. I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation and the digital flywheel. Our approach is investing for long-term value creation while driving excellence in execution today is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.
Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.
Our Americas business was more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis.
AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal '17. This is where our focus on innovative new store designs from express stores to Roasterys, elevating the customer experience and innovative premium offerings are paying off. 
Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions, resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This followed the foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. 
While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately 2 points and ticket up by approximately 2 points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on 1 ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program. 
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately 2 points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Machiatto, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.
Food contributed 1 point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last 2 years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our bistro box platform through the power lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.
Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4, and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster, with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented e-mail campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend. 
A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. 
To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. 
For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and reward them with Stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation. We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. 
And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time personalized product suggestions and the ability to save favorite orders. And there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remains strong despite moderating GDP growth in China, and we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next 5 years. 
Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. 
As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remains strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. 
We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 65 -- 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio.
With loyalty as the cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 of our 15 CAP markets offer loyalty program and stored value card. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY '16. The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China, where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year. This despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. 
We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY '16, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed. The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by shared gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over 0.5 point of share. Starbucks continues to be the #1 K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caffè Latte K-Cups, including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category and gaining over 1 full point of market share in the quarter. 
In addition to being the #1 premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the #2 brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our ready-to-drink business performed well, with Doubleshot Frappuccino and chilled multiserve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment. 
We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017.
In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally-manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities. And although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand. In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks and Espresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France, and the early results are encouraging. Channel Development continues to perform extremely well, with additional growth opportunities just getting started.
On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. 
We will also introduce our first specialty cold brew coffee for the holidays, Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. Our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today. 
A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As the leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year '16 results reflect this mindset. 
I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives, and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?"

Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra wee",2153,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion and operating margin of 27.6%, driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments. 
I'd like to call out 2 specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4; a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4; some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and 2 points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017.
Second, America's operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks' China/Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP, once again, the segment with the strongest quarterly top and bottom line growth. 
Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds make CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.
Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. 
Foreign exchange impact -- impacted EMEA margin significantly in Q4, with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.
As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for this segment was $244 million and operating margin was 47.1%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. 
Noteworthy is the Channel Development Q4 revenue growth, excluding the extra week, was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high single digits for the current quarter. 
Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion, with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately 2 points of impact from foreign exchange. 
Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments. Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9%, but reached 10% after adjusting for 1 point of negative FX impact. 
Going down to the segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is that CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change. Excluding these 2 items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store-level profitability in both China and Japan.
For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.
Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. 
We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we have both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year. Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely nontaxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition.
The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY '17 to be in the mid-single-digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. 
Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016 with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed. Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, 2/3 of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. 
These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A, partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments.
We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world, including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances with key [ph] markets. 
Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments, and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments. 
Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. 
Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. 
All of the segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis. Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.
Either FX or commodities are excited to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favor. We have our coffee needs about 2/3 price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion. 
As I said at the outset, Starbucks' fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic consumer and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. 
We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash returned to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enable us -- enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.

I guess, if you're loyal, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to so I took another risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience, it has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we've set out to build a new brand and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now many of us have seen this take place in other industries: the fashion industry, the automobile industry. I think a good analogue is what Nike's been able to do with Air Jordan, and that has built a profit center and a subbrand that onto itself is a growth engine and as a result of that shines a halo on the entire company. Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our that's the Espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods. That has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and candidly at a higher ticket. And so we're taking learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores. Those are the 4 stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customers coming into the store and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the reserve bar in the presentation, and they're moving over to the reserve bar, and now purchasing Espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, different taste profile, higher ticket and obviously, that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going to be in 10, 20, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers? So we have been diligently working on a new store format, and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,500, 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all the romance without roasting in the store with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand. The pyramid starts with the Roastery, it goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity that not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally and most importantly, take the company up. But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third-wave coffee. This is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million-strong, and we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience. And the Roastery is a true source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it. And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand."

We haven't heard much in terms of new alliances, for example, to broaden that so people who may not have been Starbucks customers become members through other organizations or affiliations you may have. Where do you stand on that process?"

We know that very few of our customers, relatively speaking, have become members. And that, to us, represents an enormous opportunity moving forward. What we do know is that when we are able to convert somebody into being a member of the program, we see tremendous incrementality as they join the program and we continue to see that accelerate. Over the past few months, we've worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member engagement that we had anticipated from the launch of the program. So completely on track and accelerating in that regard. Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have out for the next 2 quarters, is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the curved volume be due to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards. And just on the topic of extending outside of Starbucks, it's never been our intention to have Starbucks Stars be used at other venues. But we are going to be giving customers the opportunity to earn Stars at other venues starting with a partnership with Chase, which we previously announced."

I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S. Economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017. And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we've had over the last couple of quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we report in 3Q and 4Q. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2, so that weighs into the guidance. And then the third thing and perhaps the most important thing is we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this during Investor Day. But they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve-focused stores that we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels. We see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the Digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. I'm sure John, you've used the favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense urban area that pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want. Same thing with favorite items for highly customized beverages so that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling whereas a customer is building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about in the food side that will sample at Investor Day. And so I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's the number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus I think the first 6 months or so, it'll be towards the lower end of that range."

We could predict and forecast based upon what we saw on a singular account, somebody coming in and buying something and then right away using the same account again by something else. And that accounted for about 1 point of what we call transaction splitting going away. But what we were able to see through the end of the second quarter, especially as people adjusted their habits, was that there was actually consolidation taking place between multiple accounts. And of course, there would have been no way for us to see that before. But what we saw were multiple beverages being put on Starbucks Rewards accounts where they hadn't been put on there before. When you roll that all up together, what that means is we had 2 total points of what had been recorded on separate accounts before now being consolidated on to a single account. So while the actual traffic wasn't any different, we're seeing consolidation of 2 points when you take both of those things into consideration."

And I think also, I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room, you'll hear us talk about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean, I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that has -- that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week were in China and Japan and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week. And I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election. And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard is very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out. So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media so that we are not, in any way, kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there'll be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about 3 years ago, and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic. I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation in FedEx, and he shared with me a piece of research, which showed a significant drop in food traffic in -- on main street and in malls not only domestically and around the world as a result of e-commerce, the web and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores but announce closures. And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next 5 years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omnichannel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape. We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third-place environment and people looking for and seeking out human contact in a place to go. That as these store closures occur and they will, that we're going to be in a very unique position 5, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category, I'm talking overall. But we are in a very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change and how people are buying things. And that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail, but we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores. So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people and really, I think, create breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. Just one thing about the Roastery, as New York and Shanghai open, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, we're just going to -- it's going to change the company, the brand and everything we too."

That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically. We've been doing this in Asia for a while. But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in existing or new Starbucks store, what we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York, and I'll mention them again, 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois, what we're seeing and it's early days is that customers are moving their core beverages to the Espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made and the ticket is going up but it's early. So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores, coupled with the Roastery is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that we believe will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand, and as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks.

What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection really come to life in a very special and unique way.

And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos, and really, we are educating customers one at a time in China around great-tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide. You walk into New York City, we're there are a couple of weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods.

I'm just wondering how you think about that whole list or maybe just define what that mid-single-digit range actually means in terms of numbers."

And I think what I would say, Jeffrey, is we started the quarter -- we guided really on Americas to get to a 5% comp and we got there. Obviously, as you know, and it's the nature of your question, the U.S. business is the biggest piece of that. What I would say is with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly, comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment. Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation, including limited time offers, Teavana iced tea. We had a pretty good quarter in food, and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And as I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason. And I think in the first half with those types of compares and the backdrop we have, I think we're just thinking we're going to be at the lower end of that range. And of course, as always, if we can beat it, we will."

And if you look at our history of trying to do everything we can to really add shareholder value in everything we do, to just try and just take a step back every now and then and recognize that comp store sales, although we all recognize its importance is not a driving force of a company that did $20 billion in revenue and $4 billion in operating profit and is adding a store a day in China and is on its way to building one of the most recognized and admired brands in the world. And yet we're so focused on something that yes, it is important and it is strategic but it is not everything. So just maybe every now and then, recognize that we will have comps that we'll overachieve, and we'll have some comps that probably will disappoint. But we are here for the long game. This is the 24th year of our public life. The company had a market cap of $250 million at that point. It's at almost $80 billion today and it's just the beginning.

And so dry foods remain well over 50% of our stores. So we're going into different real estate than we were back then. We have smaller footprint stores, we have the larger footprint stores, including Reserve bars that Howard talked about.

Starbucks' record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results highlighted by an 11% increase in global revenues, a 17% increase in non-GAAP EPS and record operating margins despite persistent economic, consumer and geopolitical headwinds and the significant investments we continue to make in our people and our business and once again demonstrating the power, relevance and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand.
Today, Starbucks is delivering an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to over 85 million customers through our 25,000 stores in 75 countries every week. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is propelling our business forward in markets and channels around the world as never before. 
But our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee. The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation to the next wave of growth in our business starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme. 
On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. Then Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets. 
Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just 2 weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable. These stores of any stores in the world and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016. 
There are countless examples over the last decade of Western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.
Now as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over store day a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.
We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I'm convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.
These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roastery is a fine coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks Coffee authority and retail express. And the portfolio of Roasterys we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.
Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning 2-level 30,000 square foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-sensory experience, emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers. 
Starbucks' business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle-class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. 
And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasterys in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first Roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017. 
Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasterys is supported by the one-of-a-kind ultra-premium Reserve experience our Roasterys deliver to our customers and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery. We're fully -- where full year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be 4x the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.
Nitro, for example, an innovative new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too is Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso as well as handcrafted proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.
As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasterys will serve as the foundation for the exciting new format coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores. Also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. 
The first of these new format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year. And we are extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to include Reserve Espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customer response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging as customers are trading up to premium Espresso beverages. 
Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long term is what drives the results we deliver quarter-to-quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. 
Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week, a company paid --  are given a company-paid 4-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.
Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and 4x the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population. The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making 2 years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success but also from the perspective of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareholders, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry.
We demonstrated this again in Q4 and fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance. 11% top line and 17% bottom line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly. 
A few final thoughts before handling the call over to Kevin. Since its opening 2 years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. 
We knew from the start that the Roastery will introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery will support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world. 
But what we are achieving is much more than that. Its innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at -- at once, a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience like Reserve bars that, over the next few years, will incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores. 
Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity, over time, for 20 to 30 Roasterys in influential cities around the world to finding the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to Reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability and drive incrementality through new premium locations we currently do not capture.
I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all points the next wave of growth for our company. 
In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. And it's why Roasterys, Reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success. The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. 
But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China, or for that matter, Seattle where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with Reserve bars at 10 Waverly Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. 
Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

In fiscal year '16, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%, and we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. 
We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasterys, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China. I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation and the digital flywheel. Our approach is investing for long-term value creation while driving excellence in execution today is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.
Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.
Our Americas business was more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis.
AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal '17. This is where our focus on innovative new store designs from express stores to Roasterys, elevating the customer experience and innovative premium offerings are paying off. 
Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions, resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This followed the foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. 
While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately 2 points and ticket up by approximately 2 points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on 1 ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program. 
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately 2 points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Macchiato, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.
Food contributed 1 point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last 2 years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our bistro box platform through the power lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.
Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4, and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster, with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented e-mail campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend. 
A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. 
To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. 
For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and reward them with Stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation. We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. 
And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time personalized product suggestions and the ability to save favorite orders. And there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remains strong despite moderating GDP growth in China, and we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next 5 years. 
Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. 
As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remains strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. 
We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 65 -- 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio.
With loyalty as the cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 of our 15 CAP markets offer loyalty program and stored value card. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY '16. The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China, where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year. This despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. 
We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY '16, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed. The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by shared gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over 0.5 point of share. Starbucks continues to be the #1 K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caffè Latte K-Cups, including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category and gaining over 1 full point of market share in the quarter. 
In addition to being the #1 premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the #2 brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our ready-to-drink business performed well, with Doubleshot Frappuccino and chilled multiserve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment. 
We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017.
In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally-manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities. And although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand. In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks and Espresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France, and the early results are encouraging. Channel Development continues to perform extremely well, with additional growth opportunities just getting started.
On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. 
We will also introduce our first specialty cold brew coffee for the holidays, Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. Our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today. 
A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As the leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year '16 results reflect this mindset. 
I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives, and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?"
34745,374525775,1073224,"Starbucks Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra wee",2152,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion and operating margin of 27.6%, driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments. 
I'd like to call out 2 specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4; a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4; some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and 2 points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017.
Second, America's operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks' China/Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP, once again, the segment with the strongest quarterly top and bottom line growth. 
Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds make CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.
Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. 
Foreign exchange impact -- impacted EMEA margin significantly in Q4, with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.
As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for this segment was $244 million and operating margin was 47.1%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. 
Noteworthy is the Channel Development Q4 revenue growth, excluding the extra week, was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high single digits for the current quarter. 
Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion, with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately 2 points of impact from foreign exchange. 
Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments. Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9%, but reached 10% after adjusting for 1 point of negative FX impact. 
Going down to the segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is that CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change. Excluding these 2 items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store-level profitability in both China and Japan.
For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.
Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. 
We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we have both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year. Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely nontaxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition.
The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY '17 to be in the mid-single-digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. 
Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016 with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed. Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, 2/3 of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. 
These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A, partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments.
We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world, including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances with key markets. 
Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments, and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments. 
Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. 
Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. 
All of the segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis. Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.
Either FX or commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favorable. We have our coffee needs about 2/3 price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion. 
As I said at the outset, Starbucks' fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic consumer and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. 
We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash returned to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enable us -- enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.

I guess, if you're loyal, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to, so I took a little risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience, it has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we've set out to build a new brand and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now many of us have seen this take place in other industries: the fashion industry, the automobile industry. I think a good analogue is what Nike has been able to do with Air Jordan, and that is build a profit center and a subbrand that onto itself is a growth engine and as a result of that shines a halo on the entire company. Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our [indiscernible] that's the Espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods. That has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and candidly at a higher ticket. And so we're taking, learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores. Those are the 4 stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customer is coming into the store and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the Reserve bar in the presentation, and they're moving over to the Reserve bar, and now purchasing Espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, different taste profile, higher ticket and obviously, that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going to be in 10, 20, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers? So we have been diligently working on a new store format, and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,500, 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all the romance without roasting in the store with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand. The pyramid starts with the Roastery, it goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity that not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally and most importantly, take the company up. But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third-wave coffee. This is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million-strong, and we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience. And the Roastery is a true source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it. And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand."

Over the past few months, we've worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member engagement that we had anticipated from the launch of the program. So we're completely on track and accelerating in that regard. Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have out of the -- in the next 2 quarters, is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the curved volume we do to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards. And just on the topic of extending outside of Starbucks, it's never been our intention to have Starbucks Stars be used at other venues. But we are going to be giving customers the opportunity to earn Stars at other venues starting with a partnership with Chase, which we previously announced."

I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S. Economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017. And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we've had over the last couple of quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we report in 3Q and 4Q. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2, so that weighs in to the guidance. And then the third thing and perhaps the most important thing is we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this during Investor Day. But they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve-focused stores that we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels. We see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the Digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. I'm sure, John, you've used the favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense urban area that pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want. Same thing with favorite items for highly customized beverages so that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling whereas a customer is building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about in the food side that will sample at Investor Day. And so I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's the number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus, I think, the first 6 months or so, it'll be towards the lower end of that range."

And that accounted for about 1 point of what we call transaction splitting going away. But what we were able to see through the end of the second quarter, especially as people adjusted their habits, was that there was actually consolidation taking place between multiple accounts. And of course, there would have been no way for us to see that before. But what we saw were multiple beverages being put on Starbucks Rewards accounts where they hadn't been put on there before. When you roll that all up together, what that means is we had 2 total points of what had been recorded on separate accounts before now being consolidated on to a single account.

And I think -- also, I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room, you'll hear us talking about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean, I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that has -- that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week were in China and Japan, and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week. And I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election. And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard is very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out. So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media, so that we are not, in any way, kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there'll be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about 3 years ago, and that is a seismic shift in consumer traffic. I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation in FedEx, and he shared with me a piece of research, which showed a significant drop in food traffic in -- on main street and in malls not only domestically and around the world as a result of e-commerce, the web and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only -- not open new stores but announce closures. And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next 5 years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omnichannel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape. We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third-place environment and people looking for and seeking out human contact in a place to go. That as these store closures occur and they will, that we're going to be in a very unique position 5, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category, I'm talking overall. But we are in a very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change and how people are buying things. And that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail, but we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores. So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people and really, I think, create a breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. Just one thing about the Roastery, as New York and Shanghai open, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, we're just going to -- it's going to change the company, the brand and everything we do."

That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically. We've been doing this in Asia for a while. But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in existing or new Starbucks store, what we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York, and I'll mention them again, 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois, what we're seeing and it's early days is that customers are moving their core beverages to the Espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made and the ticket is going up but it's early. So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores, coupled with the Roastery is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that we believe will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand, and as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks.

What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection really come to life in a very special and unique way. And really played out for us very clearly in China by the fact that a lot of the Chinese consumers didn't have a lot of education around coffee and didn't have a lot of education around brewing methods, Espresso-based beverages. And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos, and really, we are educating customers one at a time in China around great-tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide. You walk into New York City, we're there a couple of weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods. And it's really something that really elevates the experience and the customer response has been incredible, number one. And even the partner engagement around this has been remarkable as well. So we're very positive and optimistic about what the future has for this for us."

We delivered a 6% comp in the market, far above any of our peer set in that environment over there. What we are seeing across China is just very strong acceptance for the Starbucks brand. You look at the number of customers that we're attracting into our stores, our brand has never been stronger and the customer engagement has never been stronger as well. So we're increasing frequency of existing customers, and we continue to attract new customers. What you saw in Q4 was very similar to what we saw last Q4. Last Q4 last year, we delivered a 6. This quarter, we delivered a 6 as well. There is some seasonality going from Q3 to Q4. We've seen that historically play out in China. I don't think you need to read anything into it other than the fact that our business there remains strong. We had record openings in terms of stores in the quarter in China, opening over 200 stores in the market. Our new store performance is as strong as it's ever been. Our average unit volumes, our return on investment and our overall store level profitability remains best-in-class within the company. So very optimistic again about China and the opportunity that we have there to continue to grow.

I'm wondering if you would look about it maybe qualitatively. How much do you think was the macro -- elevated macro headwinds versus maybe any kind of internal headwinds that made it more challenging to hit that. And with that as a backdrop, I know you talked a lot about the broader macro challenge we're facing and starting the year kind of at the lower end of that range. So just wondering whether the mid-single digit or better is still the best assumption to make once you get to the system your size, or whether or not maybe we should just be tempering the expectation a little bit so it becomes less about the quarter-to-quarter of achieving a certain 5% or whatnot. I'm just wondering how you think about that holistically or maybe just define what that mid-single-digit range actually means in terms of numbers."

And I think what I would say, Jeffrey, is we started the quarter -- we guided really on Americas to get to a 5% comp and we got there. Obviously, as you know, and it's the nature of your question, the U.S. business is the biggest piece of that. What I would say is with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly, comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter, and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment. Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation, including limited time offers, Teavana Iced Tea. We had a pretty good quarter in food, and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And as I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason. And I think in the first half with those types of compares and the backdrop we have, I think we're just thinking we're going to be at the lower end of that range.

And if you look at our history of trying to do everything we can to really add shareholder value in everything we do, to just try and just take a step back every now and then and recognize that comp store sales, although we all recognize its importance is not the driving force of a company that did $20 billion in revenue and $4 billion in operating profit and is adding a store a day in China and is on its way to building one of the most recognized and admired brands in the world. And yet, we're so focused on something that, yes, it is important and it is strategic but it is not everything. So just maybe every now and then, recognize that we will have comps that we'll overachieve, and we'll have some comps that probably will disappoint. But we are here for the long game.

And even in markets like China and the U.S. where we're opening significant numbers of company-owned stores, we're using different formats as we go into market. And so dry foods remain well over 50% of our stores. So we're going into different real estate than we were back then. We have smaller footprint stores, we have the larger footprint stores, including Reserve bars that Howard talked about.

So we feel very good about the kind of growth and share that we've been able to drive.

Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Starbucks Global Retail; Cliff Burrows, Group President of Siren Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development. I'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal 2016 year had 53 weeks as opposed to the usual 52 weeks.

We'll be presenting our GAAP results for the 14-week quarter and 53-week full year, but some of our discussion will be on a non-GAAP basis excluding the extra week. 
As a further reminder, non-GAAP earnings also continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. Please refer to the reconciliation table at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
This conference call will also include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. These such statements should be considered in connection with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.

The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation to the next wave of growth in our business starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme. 
On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. Then Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets. 
Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just 2 weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable. These stores [audio gap] of any stores in the world, and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016. 
There are countless examples over the last decade of Western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.
Now as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over a store a day -- a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.
We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I'm convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.
These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roasterys define coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks Coffee authority and retail express. And the portfolio of Roasterys we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.
Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning 2-level 30,000 square foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-sensory experience, emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers. 
Starbucks' business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market, as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle-class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. 
And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasterys in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first Roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017. 
Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasterys is supported by the one-of-a-kind ultra-premium Reserve experience our Roasterys deliver to our customers and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery. We're fully -- where full year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be 4x the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.
Nitro, for example, an innovative new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too is Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso as well as handcrafted proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.
As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasterys will serve as the foundation for the exciting new format, coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores, also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. 
The first of these new format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year. And we are extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to include Reserve Espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customer response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging as customers are trading up to premium Espresso beverages. 
Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long term is what drives the results we deliver quarter-to-quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. 
Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week a company paid --  are given a company-paid 4-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.
Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and 4x the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population. The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making 2 years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success but also from the perspective of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareholders, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry.
We demonstrated this again in Q4 in fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance. 11% top line and 17% bottom line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly. 
A few final thoughts before handling (sic) the call over to Kevin. Since its opening 2 years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. 
We knew from the start that the Roastery would introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery would support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world. 
But what we are achieving is much more than that. It's innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at -- at once, a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience like Reserve bars that, over the next few years, we will incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores. 
Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity, over time, for 20 to 30 Roasterys in influential cities around the world to finding the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to Reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability and drive incrementality through new premium locations we currently do not capture.
I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all point the next wave of growth for our company. 
In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. And it's why Roasterys, Reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success. The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. 
But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China or, for that matter, Seattle where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with Reserve bars at 10 Waverly Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. 
Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

Starbucks' strong performance in Q4 capped off another record year for the company. In fiscal year '16, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew glob",1935,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' strong performance in Q4 capped off another record year for the company. In fiscal year '16, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%, and we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. 
We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasterys, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China. I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation and the digital flywheel. Our approach of investing for long-term value creation while driving excellence in execution today is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.
Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.
Our Americas business, with more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis.
AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal '17. This is where our focus on innovative new store designs, from express stores to Roasterys, elevating the customer experience and innovative premium offerings are paying off. 
Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions, resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This followed the foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. 
While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately 2 points and ticket up by approximately 2 points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on 1 ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program. 
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately 2 points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Macchiato, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.
Food contributed 1 point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last 2 years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our bistro box platform through the power lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.
Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4, and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster, with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented e-mail campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend. 
A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. 
To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. 
For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and rewards them with Stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation. We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. 
And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time personalized product suggestions and the ability to save favorite orders. And there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remains strong. Despite moderating GDP growth in China, we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next 5 years. 
Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. 
As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remained strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. 
We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 65 -- 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio.
With loyalty as the cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 of our 15 CAP markets offer loyalty programs and stored value cards. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY '16. The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China, where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year -- this despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. 
We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY '16, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed. The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by shared gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over 0.5 point of share. Starbucks continued to be the #1 K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caffè Latte K-Cups, including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category and gaining over 1 full point of market share in the quarter. 
In addition to being the #1 premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the #2 brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our ready-to-drink business performed well, with Doubleshot Frappuccino and chilled multiserve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment. 
We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017.
In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities. And although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand. In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks in Espresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France, and the early results are encouraging. Channel development continues to perform extremely well, with additional growth opportunities just getting started.
On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. 
We will also introduce our first specialty cold brew coffee for the holidays, Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. Our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today. 
A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As the leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year '16 results reflect this mindset. 
I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives, and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?"
34745,374525775,1073417,"Starbucks Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Starbucks Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra wee",2152,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion and operating margin of 27.6%, driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments. 
I'd like to call out 2 specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4; a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4; some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and 2 points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017.
Second, America's operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks' China/Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP, once again, the segment with the strongest quarterly top and bottom line growth. 
Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds make CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.
Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. 
Foreign exchange impact -- impacted EMEA margin significantly in Q4, with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.
As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for this segment was $244 million and operating margin was 47.1%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. 
Noteworthy is that Channel Development Q4 revenue growth, excluding the extra week, was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high single digits for the current quarter. 
Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion, with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately 2 points of impact from foreign exchange. 
Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments. Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9%, but reached 10% after adjusting for 1 point of negative FX impact. 
Drilling down to the segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is that CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change. Excluding these 2 items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store-level profitability in both China and Japan.
For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.
Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. 
We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we have both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year. Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely nontaxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition.
The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY '17 to be in the mid-single-digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. 
Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016 with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed. Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, 2/3 of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. 
These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A, partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments.
We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world, including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances in key markets. 
Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments, and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments. 
Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. 
Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year, though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. 
All of the segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis. Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.
Neither FX nor commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favorable. We have our coffee needs about 2/3 price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion. 
As I said at the outset, Starbucks' fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic, consumer and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. 
We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash returned to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enable us -- enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

I guess, if you're a lawyer, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to, so I took a little risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience that has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we've set out to build a new brand, and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now many of us have seen this take place in other industries: the fashion industry, the automobile industry. I think a good analogue is what Nike has been able to do with Air Jordan, and that is build a profit center and a subbrand that unto itself is a growth engine and as a result of that shines a halo on the entire company. Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our parlance, that's the Espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods. That has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and candidly at a higher ticket. And so we're taking, learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores. Those are the 4 stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customer is coming into the store and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the Reserve bar in the presentation, and they're moving over to the Reserve bar, and now purchasing Espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, a different taste profile, higher ticket and obviously, that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going to be in 10, 20, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers? So we have been diligently working on a new store format, and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,500, 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all of the romance without roasting in the store, with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand. The pyramid starts with the Roastery, it goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity to not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally and most importantly, take the company up. But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third-wave coffee. This is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million-strong, and we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience. And the Roastery is a true source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it. And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand."

Over the past few months, we've worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member engagement that we had anticipated from the launch of the program. So we're completely on track and accelerating in that regard. Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have ahead of us in the next 2 quarters, is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the current volume we do, to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards. And just on the topic of extending outside of Starbucks, it's never been our intention to have Starbucks Stars be used at other venues. But we are going to be giving customers the opportunity to earn Stars at other venues starting with a partnership with Chase, which we previously announced."

I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S. Economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017. And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we've had over the last couple of quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we report in 3Q and 4Q. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2, so that weighs in to the guidance. And then the third thing and perhaps the most important thing is we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this during Investor Day. But they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve-focused stores, that we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels. We see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the Digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. And I'm sure, John, you've used the favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense urban area to pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want. Same thing with favorite items for highly customized beverages, so that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling where, as a customer is building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about on the food side that will sample at Investor Day. And so I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's a number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus, I think, the first 6 months or so, it'll be towards the lower end of that range."

We could predict and forecast based upon what we saw on a singular account, somebody coming in and buying something and then right away using the same account again to buy something else. And that accounted for about 1 point of what we call transaction splitting going away. But what we were able to see through the end of the second quarter, especially as people adjusted their habits, was that there was actually consolidation taking place between multiple accounts. And of course, there would have been no way for us to see that before. But what we saw were multiple beverages being put on Starbucks Rewards accounts where they hadn't been put on there before. When you roll that all up together, what that means is we had 2 total points of what had been recorded on separate accounts before now being consolidated on to a single account.

And I think -- also, I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room, you'd hear us talking about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean, I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that has -- that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week were in China and Japan, and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week. And I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election. And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard, it's very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out. So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media, so that we are not, in any way, kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there'll be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about 3 years ago, and that is a seismic shift in consumer traffic. I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation in FedEx, and he shared with me a piece of research, which showed a significant drop in food traffic in -- on main street and in malls not only domestically but around the world as a result of e-commerce, the web and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only -- not open new stores but announce closures. And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next 5 years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omnichannel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape. We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third-place environment and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go. That as these store closures occur -- and they will -- that we're going to be in a very unique position 5, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category, I'm talking overall. But we are in a very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things. And that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail, but we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores. So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people and really, I think, create a breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. Just one thing about the Roastery, as New York and Shanghai open, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, we're just going to -- it's going to change the company, the brand and everything we do."

I think we're through with anything you might characterize as disruption, but I want to be careful with what I mean there. Number one is that we saw no attrition from the so-called disadvantaged people. We studied this issue very carefully and tracked it all through the summer, and we did not see those people who are not earning rewards as quickly diminish in any way within the program. The thing that we did want to see last quarter but which we saw this quarter was an acceleration in spend per member. So keep in mind that the reason why we did this was to be able to have the lever not just of transaction but also of ticket. That didn't materialize in Q3 but did materialize in Q4, and we are seeing acceleration in the spending per member. So we're feeling very, very good about having come out of the program transition with very minimal collateral damage in any way and a good trajectory in front of us, especially as we lean into acquiring new members."

That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically, and we've been doing this in Asia for a while. But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in existing or new Starbucks store, what we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York -- and I'll mention them again, 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois -- what we're seeing in its early days is that customers are moving their core beverages to the Espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made, and the ticket is going up -- but it's early. So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores, coupled with the Roastery, is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that we believe will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand, and as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks.

What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection really come to life in a very special and unique way. And it really played out for us very clearly in China by the fact that a lot of the Chinese consumers didn't have a lot of education around coffee and didn't have a lot of education around brewing methods, Espresso-based beverages. And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos, and really, we are educating customers one at a time in China around great-tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide. You walk into New York City -- we were there a couple of weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar, wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods. And it's really something that really elevates the experience and the customer response has been incredible, number one. And even the partner engagement around this has been remarkable as well.

So we're increasing frequency of existing customers, and we continue to attract new customers. What you saw in Q4 was very similar to what we saw last Q4. Last Q4 last year, we delivered a 6. This quarter, we delivered a 6 as well. There is some seasonality going from Q3 to Q4. We've seen that historically play out in China. I don't think you need to read anything into it other than the fact that our business there remains strong. We had record openings in terms of stores in the quarter in China, opening over 200 stores in the market. Our new store performance is as strong as it's ever been. Our average unit volumes, our return on investment and our overall store level profitability remains best-in-class within the company.

And with that as a backdrop, I know you talked a lot about the broader macro challenge you were facing and starting the year kind of at the lower end of that range. So just wondering whether the mid-single digit or better is still the best assumption to make once you get to a system your size, or whether or not maybe we should just be tempering the expectation a little bit so it becomes less about the quarter-to-quarter of achieving a certain 5% or whatnot.

And I think what I would say, Jeffrey, is we started the quarter -- we guided really on Americas to get to a 5% comp and we got there. Obviously, as you know, and it's the nature of your question, the U.S. business is the biggest piece of that. What I would say is with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, it gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly, comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter, and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment. Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation, including limited time offers, Teavana Iced Tea. We had a pretty good quarter in food, and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And as I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason. And I think in the first half with those types of compares and the backdrop we have, I think we're just thinking we're going to be at the lower end of that range.

Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Starbucks Global Retail; Cliff Burrows, Group President of Siren Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development. I'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal 2016 year had 53 weeks as opposed to the usual 52 weeks.

As a further reminder, non-GAAP earnings also continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. Please refer to the reconciliation table at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
This conference call will also include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. These such statements should be considered in connection with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

Wonderful to have you, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results highlighted by an 11% increase in global revenues, a 17% increase in non-GAAP EPS and record operating margins despite persistent economic, consumer and geopolitical headwinds and the significant investments we continue to make in our people and our business and once again demonstrating the power, relevance and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand.
Today, Starbucks is delivering an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to over 85 million customers through our 25,000 stores in 75 countries every week. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is propelling our business forward in markets and channels around the world as never before. 
But our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee. The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation to the next wave of growth in our business starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme. 
On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. Then Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets. 
Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just 2 weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable. These stores 
[Audio Gap] 
of any stores in the world, and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016. 
There are countless examples over the last decade of Western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.
Now as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over a store a day -- a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.
We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I'm convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.
These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roasterys define coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks Coffee authority and retail express. And the portfolio of Roasterys we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.
Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning 2-level 30,000 square foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-sensory experience, emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers. 
Starbucks' business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market, as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle-class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. 
And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasterys in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first Roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017. 
Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasterys is supported by the one-of-a-kind ultra-premium Reserve experience our Roasterys deliver to our customers and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery. We're fully -- where full year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be 4x the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.
Nitro, for example, an innovative new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too is Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso as well as handcrafted proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.
As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasterys will serve as the foundation for the exciting new format, coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores, also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. 
The first of these new format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year. And we are extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to include Reserve Espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customer response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging as customers are trading up to premium Espresso beverages. 
Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long term is what drives the results we deliver quarter-to-quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. 
Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week a company paid -- are given a company-paid 4-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.
Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and 4x the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population. The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making 2 years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success but also from the perspective of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareholders, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry.
We demonstrated this again in Q4 in fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance. 11% top line and 17% bottom line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly. 
A few final thoughts before handling the call over to Kevin. Since its opening 2 years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. 
We knew from the start that the Roastery would introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery would support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world. 
But what we are achieving is much more than that. It's innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at -- at once, a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience like Reserve bars that, over the next few years, we will incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores. 
Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity, over time, for 20 to 30 Roasterys in influential cities around the world to finding the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to Reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability and drive incrementality through new premium locations we currently do not capture.
I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all point the next wave of growth for our company. 
In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead. And it's why Roasterys, Reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success. The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. 
But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China or, for that matter, Seattle where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with Reserve bars at 10 Waverly Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. 
Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?"

In fiscal year '16, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%, and we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. 
We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasterys, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China. I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation and the digital flywheel. Our approach of investing for long-term value creation while driving excellence in execution today is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.
Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.
Our Americas business, with more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis.
AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal '17. This is where our focus on innovative new store designs, from express stores to Roasterys, elevating the customer experience and innovative premium offerings are paying off. 
Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions, resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This followed the foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. 
While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately 2 points and ticket up by approximately 2 points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on 1 ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program. 
Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately 2 points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Macchiato, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.
Food contributed 1 point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last 2 years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our bistro box platform through the power lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.
Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4, and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster, with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented e-mail campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend. 
A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. 
To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. 
For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and rewards them with Stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation. We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. 
And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time personalized product suggestions and the ability to save favorite orders. And there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remains strong. Despite moderating GDP growth in China, we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next 5 years. 
Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. 
As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remained strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. 
We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 65 -- 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio.
With loyalty as the cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 of our 15 CAP markets offer loyalty programs and stored value cards. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY '16. The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China, where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year -- this despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. 
We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY '16, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed. The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.
Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by shared gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over 0.5 point of share. Starbucks continued to be the #1 K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caffè Latte K-Cups, including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the #1 premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category and gaining over 1 full point of market share in the quarter. 
In addition to being the #1 premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the #2 brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our ready-to-drink business performed well, with Doubleshot Frappuccino and chilled multiserve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment. 
We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017.
In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities. And although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand. In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks in Espresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France, and the early results are encouraging. Channel development continues to perform extremely well, with additional growth opportunities just getting started.
On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. 
We will also introduce our first specialty cold brew coffee for the holidays, Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. Our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today. 
A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As the leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year '16 results reflect this mindset. 
I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives, and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?"

Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra wee",2152,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter, capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis, it was $0.56, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis. 
I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion and operating margin of 27.6%, driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments. 
I'd like to call out 2 specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4; a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4; some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and 2 points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017.
Second, America's operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.
Let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks' China/Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP, once again, the segment with the strongest quarterly top and bottom line growth. 
Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds make CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.
Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. 
Foreign exchange impact -- impacted EMEA margin significantly in Q4, with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.
As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for this segment was $244 million and operating margin was 47.1%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. 
Noteworthy is that Channel Development Q4 revenue growth, excluding the extra week, was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high single digits for the current quarter. 
Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion, with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately 2 points of impact from foreign exchange. 
Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments. Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9%, but reached 10% after adjusting for 1 point of negative FX impact. 
Drilling down to the segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is that CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change. Excluding these 2 items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store-level profitability in both China and Japan.
For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.
Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. 
We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we have both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year. Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely nontaxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition.
The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY '17 to be in the mid-single-digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. 
Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016 with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed. Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, 2/3 of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. 
These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A, partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments.
We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world, including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances in key markets. 
Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments, and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments. 
Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. 
Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year, though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. 
All of the segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis. Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.
Neither FX nor commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favorable. We have our coffee needs about 2/3 price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion. 
As I said at the outset, Starbucks' fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic, consumer and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. 
We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash returned to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enable us -- enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.

I guess, if you're a lawyer, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to, so I took a little risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience that has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we've set out to build a new brand, and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now many of us have seen this take place in other industries: the fashion industry, the automobile industry. I think a good analogue is what Nike has been able to do with Air Jordan, and that is build a profit center and a subbrand that unto itself is a growth engine and as a result of that shines a halo on the entire company. Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our parlance, that's the Espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods. That has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and candidly at a higher ticket. And so we're taking, learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores. Those are the 4 stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customer is coming into the store and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the Reserve bar in the presentation, and they're moving over to the Reserve bar, and now purchasing Espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, a different taste profile, higher ticket and obviously, that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going to be in 10, 20, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers? So we have been diligently working on a new store format, and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,500, 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all of the romance without roasting in the store, with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand. The pyramid starts with the Roastery, it goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity to not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally and most importantly, take the company up. But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third-wave coffee. This is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million-strong, and we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience. And the Roastery is a true source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it. And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand."

Over the past few months, we've worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member engagement that we had anticipated from the launch of the program. So we're completely on track and accelerating in that regard. Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have ahead of us in the next 2 quarters, is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the current volume we do, to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards.

I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S. Economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017. And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we've had over the last couple of quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we report in 3Q and 4Q. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2, so that weighs in to the guidance. And then the third thing and perhaps the most important thing is we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this during Investor Day. But they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve-focused stores, that we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels. We see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the Digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. And I'm sure, John, you've used the favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense urban area to pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want. Same thing with favorite items for highly customized beverages, so that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling where, as a customer is building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about on the food side that will sample at Investor Day. And so I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's a number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus, I think, the first 6 months or so, it'll be towards the lower end of that range."

And I think -- also, I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room, you'd hear us talking about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean, I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that has -- that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week were in China and Japan, and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week. And I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election. And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard, it's very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out. So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media, so that we are not, in any way, kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there'll be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about 3 years ago, and that is a seismic shift in consumer traffic. I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation in FedEx, and he shared with me a piece of research, which showed a significant drop in food traffic in -- on main street and in malls not only domestically but around the world as a result of e-commerce, the web and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only -- not open new stores but announce closures. And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next 5 years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omnichannel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape. We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third-place environment and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go. That as these store closures occur -- and they will -- that we're going to be in a very unique position 5, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category, I'm talking overall. But we are in a very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things. And that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail, but we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores. So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people and really, I think, create a breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. Just one thing about the Roastery, as New York and Shanghai open, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, we're just going to -- it's going to change the company, the brand and everything we do."

The thing that we did want to see last quarter but which we saw this quarter was an acceleration in spend per member.

That didn't materialize in Q3 but did materialize in Q4, and we are seeing acceleration in the spending per member.

That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically, and we've been doing this in Asia for a while. But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in existing or new Starbucks store, what we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York -- and I'll mention them again, 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois -- what we're seeing in its early days is that customers are moving their core beverages to the Espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made, and the ticket is going up -- but it's early. So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores, coupled with the Roastery, is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that we believe will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand, and as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks.

What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection really come to life in a very special and unique way.

And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos, and really, we are educating customers one at a time in China around great-tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide. You walk into New York City -- we were there a couple of weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar, wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods.

This quarter, we delivered a 6 as well. There is some seasonality going from Q3 to Q4. We've seen that historically play out in China. I don't think you need to read anything into it other than the fact that our business there remains strong. We had record openings in terms of stores in the quarter in China, opening over 200 stores in the market. Our new store performance is as strong as it's ever been.

So just wondering whether the mid-single digit or better is still the best assumption to make once you get to a system your size, or whether or not maybe we should just be tempering the expectation a little bit so it becomes less about the quarter-to-quarter of achieving a certain 5% or whatnot.

What I would say is with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, it gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly, comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter, and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment. Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation, including limited time offers, Teavana Iced Tea. We had a pretty good quarter in food, and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And as I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason.

In addition, I would also say that the level of innovation from a product standpoint that we're bringing into our stores has never been stronger. And so you look at cold brew, you look at Nitro, you look at Teavana, you look at some of the food gains that we've had, we continue to innovate. And then add in the digital footprint and being relevant to our customers from a digital standpoint. We are engaging our customers more now than we ever have. And the stores are that place where they come for their favorite Starbucks beverage each and every day."

Can you talk about the organic top line growth from existing and new relationships and what kind of leverage that provides to operating margin? And then when you think about the grocery store price inflation or deflation, how does that impact gross margin -- or excuse me, operating margin? And is the volume growth still outpacing revenue growth?"

So from a top line perspective, we're feeling good about the top line performance that we've had certainly this quarter. If you look at our growth as measured by IRI, both for our key businesses, roast and ground and K-Cup, we're up 8%. We're actually growing at a pace double that at the category. That's really behind, number one, our strong brand; number two, the great execution that we have behind holiday programs, our LTOs like Fall Blend in our innovation and the innovation that we have to come. So we feel very good about the kind of growth and share that we've been able to drive. And what I would say is that volume versus the price, our volume and price growth are fairly close, which means that we've been able to really get the right balance of promotional pricing -- based pricing in the marketplace. And we feel good about that. And if you look at that and the margin expansion that we've been able to realize in the quarter, I think that's kind of the right balance for us to continue to grow both the category, grow our brand and also drive share."

The CPG business, in many ways, is about scale economics, and so certainly the more we're gaining share in the grocery mass merchants that we sell to, the more efficient we are at delivering that product, so that's helping. Number two, I'll remind you that we renegotiated our agreement with Keurig, and so we got favorable K-Cup tolling fees, which are also helping. So there's a variety of things that are contributing to that. But I think the strength of the brand and the share gains that we continue to get for at-home coffee roast and ground as well as K-Cup and establishing Starbucks as the #1 share player in premium roast and ground and K-Cups is a big part of it."

You had a very good step-up in that ability to generate cash in 2016. It was about $1 billion higher versus last year. So my question is, how much of that step-up in the cash generation was driven by durable increases in cash conversion relative to more onetime things like the 53rd week or favorable year-end timing in working capital or things like that? I think that the margin commentary that you gave for 2017 made it seem like that is probably durable, but I'm curious if those balances are as good as they look."
