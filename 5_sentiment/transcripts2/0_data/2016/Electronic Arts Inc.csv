Q3 FY '16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and large services that enabled them to play more of the games mean up. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter, and we are raising our full year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum in the final quarter of the year. 
I'll highlight from the holiday quarter, capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team [indiscernible] delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for all ages. It became the largest launch ever for Star Wars game and exceeded our guidance for the full year. 
The journey's just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the 4 expansion packs that come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community. Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in their experiences in mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxies quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching a Top 5 Most Downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. 
On PC, our Star Wars community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly 3 years, driven by the larger digital expansion, [indiscernible] empire. More break content is on the way for placing each of these experiences, as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company. 
Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving 2.5x more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we've demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deeper engagement over time. 
Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices. 
As a top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the Western World for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world's biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the #1 sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the #1 title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire year EA SPORTS portfolio with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing car and car culture enthusiasts with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous games. 
Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged to their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continue to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like draft in FIFA 16 and draft champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continued to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. 
In Q3, our players worked more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay. 
Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow on subscribers, and more than 60% of those players have used EA Access to try a game they haven't previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we've just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it's clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games. 
EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA's working its players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition ever for our players time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect vibrant communities, access more games and content and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. 
In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,321591529,923148,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion, which was $28 million above our guidance.

EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion, which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our platform, including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. 
Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full year fiscal guidance of 13 million units, which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year-over-year. 
Our non-GAAP Digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter's revenue. It was also a record for the trailing 12-month period, which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key component highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, seasonal Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year-on-year or 18% year-over-year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and the Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. 
Finally FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. 
Mobile generated $162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top 3 grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS App Store through the important Christmas period and peaked at #1 on Christmas day. 
To join our broad portfolio of strong portfolio revenue-generating titles, which also include SimCity BuildIt, Sims FreePlay, the Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits and Real Racing 3. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront and offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday giftgiving became the dominant driver purchases. Note that the revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes. And this revenue would be recognized in our fourth quarter. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital total revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth and we launched a similar PC subscription Origin Access in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars: The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep storytelling. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year's 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix with Dragon acquisition last year compared to the royalty bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We have factored into the guidance our expectations at Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong giftgiving titles, but it's skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. 
The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive, the strong performance of our royalty bearing console and mobile games, which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down $10 million year-on-year driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been $22 million up, driven chiefly by increasing investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. 
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share, which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong public performance and continued cost management. 
Our cash and short-term investments in the end of the quarter was $3.23 billion or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes. 
During Q3, we settled $95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed $293 million of the $633 million total. And as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We've updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. 
We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchase keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow every generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 100 -- or $1.025 billion. 
Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, $21 million lower than last year's. The decline is driven by the absence of last year's Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants vs. Zombies Garden Worker 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in the game sale for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind. 
Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year's. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as calm $0.39 last year. 
Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46 as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. 
I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last 2 years, in the fourth quarter, we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings for our cash flow. 
Our Q4 outlook would result in a full year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $0.03 per share, respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. 
Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23 per share. Comparing cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and the free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion as capital expenditure is tracking below our $100 million estimate for the year. 
Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high watermark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and live [indiscernible] IT. This builds a deep catalog that sell 3 years and provide the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

A great line of EA SPORTS title are in development for next year and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. 
An all new battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays. We're excited to have a new time full of experience coming from our friends at Respawn and, of course, Mass Effect: Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. 
Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and update and we'll have more in mobile titles as well. 
Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts and we're thrilled to share the passion with our players through our new competitive Gaming division, led by Peter Moore.

As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competition that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway with players competing in the Madden NFL live challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week.

From our new titles to our lives services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers, like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do.

This past holiday season, I think, we've seen some industry data points that show that AAA launches reflected higher in terms of digital, but digital downloads are a bit lighter than we would expected for you all. Blake, you commented that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season, which I think makes a lot of sense given the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5, are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads? And is this 1 point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward? Second quick question, if you won't mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4? And when we think about that the DLC which will be selling for that title, is it fair to assume that the attach rate would be comparable to that of Battlefield 4?"

First, I'll remind you that full game downloads generated 195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that's still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full downloads since you couldn't have gotten the number of that size in the quarter without that. We were surprised that more giftgiving was done with Star Wars, which obviously, impacted the digital downloads. And my guess is, is that, that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards giftgiving and more towards PC, that's a very hard-core PC audience to the Battlefield audience and they tend to obviously more physical or digital downloads and physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin guidance that we've talked about in the past. We'll obviously, give you a detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title in giftgiving, we would be very surprised if we didn't shift the back to improvements in gross margin that we saw."

More and more session days with games is good for Electronic Arts, it's good for our players. We've taken a very player first view on this in which we're building community. It's clearly an entertainment medium. I think, there's a lot of excitement around of it and I can't think of anybody that's better served with the diversity of our portfolio when you think of our sports titles in particular. Take Madden as well as our Battlefield franchise that we've been able to build a meaningful business over the next couple of years."

This is a business for that in the holiday time frame between Black Friday and Christmas is traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume, particularly when people are now buying for the first time a new console. Often, they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we find the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We, obviously, share that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that each year with specific programs. And I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that. We're also doing discounting on the digital side as we try to keep it to a line, we don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. So you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year in, year out. I would say this year, our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had. There wasn't a lot of difference between years. On the sales reserve, we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter in anticipation of what our sell in is going to be. And we use those sells reserves during the quarter on a very formalized plan, that's to sell all of these sales get planned well in advance and we need to make sure that we have appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those over time. And so we'll be setting up sales reservers each quarter as we go in, and those tend not to impact margins or margins that we forecast because they're already built into the numbers."

So what we've seen is really there's 2 groups that come to the first title or come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly, of my generation or my vintage who have been gamers in the past have for whatever reason kind of moved away from it, particularly moved away from core shooters because they've become very hard and complicated and quite frankly, brutal to play online. They have come back in light of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and passion they have around that their use. At the same time, they now have kids, who are gameplaying age, who may not have gotten to the first-person shooting universe yet because of the nature of the content inside some of those games. And so we're seeing fathers and sons play, we're seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal.

I don't think there's any indication that, that this mix shift is anything but a Star Wars Battlefront opportunity. Remember, the movie was out, all things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect giftgiving opportunity. And typically would gift someone who wants to have a package under a tree or at a gift pile somewhere versus a digital code and that was driver of the shift. We could see when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing it for the sales in the industry and exactly how the buzz on Star Wars will be why that comes the next time around. So right now, I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact, we look at all of our non-Star Wars products, every one of them were up digitally in full game downloads and the digital engagement associated with them. When you look at all to ultimate teams statistics we gave you, that's a clear sign that people are playing and engaging longer and longer around the titles. In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we're not going to break out individual guidance. Obviously, we'll end up selling more than 13 million units since we've already gotten there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell less in the fourth quarter than we originally thought. But we'll clearly sell more overall and that's built into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I will remind people about fourth quarter though, don't forget that there's a continued FX headwind, headwind that we called out, that's $40 million of headwind. I'm not sure everyone's modeling that into their models. And we're not ignoring the fact that there's the economic headwinds out there around the world that haven't really impacted us, but we're being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely. In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along with traditional sports titles. The one thing to note is Q1, the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror's Edge, plus all of our catalog business in live services business. Our core console title will be Mirror's Edge. And if you're doing -- we'll give you full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call. But as you're starting to think about guidance for Q1 and next year, don't forget about the continued FX headwinds, which are impacting us, as well as in Q1 one specific item, remember that last year in Q1, we had a $30 million benefit, onetime benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue on into Q1. So that's a high profit revenue that came into Q1, a couple of basic things for your model but things to remember. But we're excited about the rest of the slate. You should assume that a Battlefield will come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it. We're not yet announcing when Titan Fall or Mass Effect Andromeda will come, but assume that's in the back half of the year as well because the second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles."

You'll see marketing expenses bounce around, depending on the title and the quarter. So this quarter, our marketing expense were up in if you FX adjust them and that was driven by the fact that we had a fairly large part of this year that we didn't have last year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars, obviously last year our largest title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter.

We've got a track record, I think, of 10 quarters in a row beating our guidance. I think we've exhibited some conservatism on how we operate the business, which we think is a prudent thing to do. And we're sitting with an FX headwind and a lot of uncertainty in the economy. You put all that together, I don't think that signals anything negative about the fourth quarter, it signals the way we've been approaching the business and operating the business and that's what we're going to continue to do. In terms of FIFA Online 3 in China, the key there is we're continuing to see very positive reactions, but we also have very long-term view there. So a continued level that we've talked about 10 million to 15 million a quarter is still consistent with where we are. And when we give you guidance in the May time frame, we'll update that number if it looks like it should be updated. But it's all very positive in that and our partner, Tencent, continues to be extremely happy. With that maybe, I'll let Andrew hit the VR question if there's anything."

I said, we have a level of conservatism about just the global economy, which at some point in time, there's trouble in the global economy that would impact everybody probably. I think our business seems to be operating pretty consistent as it has been over the last couple of years. The console purchases up through the end of calendar year '15, our estimate is 55 million units out there, which has exceeded virtually everyone's forecast for the year and is now almost 50% higher than the previous console cycle. So all of that is very, very positive, all the gameplay we're seeing and the engagement and things like Ultimate teams are seeing as positive, we're just conscious of the fact that there's a lot of storm out there, we want to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves or the economy in our forecast for the business and that's what you're hearing. The second part of the question was the Amazon issue, we do not fund the Amazon discount that comes out of Amazon. I think that's fairly consistent with how Amazon operates. And we don't have much say or view on pricing of anyone in the marketplace. That's their job, not our job. For us, if it brings new gameplayers into the business, then we're excited. But we don't really have much more to say or control over their pricing strategy."

On Star Wars, the one thing that we are hearing to and, I think, this is part of our arrangement with Lucas and Disney is you can't make a game in Star Wars that violates that canon of Star Wars. Meaning, you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline what was going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in because the extent is in the future around our current game is also based on the historical Star Wars canon, which is 30 years before the most recent movie, that will limit our ability to bring some new content into that. But more to come there, obviously, we're trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies. And we'll obviously, in future Star Wars games be able to tap the new characters and vehicles and so forth. But in our current game and for that matter, the DLC associated with that current game, obviously, we'll have to be careful that we don't violate the canon. On mobile, obviously, mobile, one thing to remember is like our console business, mobile will always be a little choppy based on when new titles come out.

Sims FreePlay, the Simpsons Tapped Out, Real Racing 3 have continued to grow over a number of years. And as we think about launching new titles, we're taking a little more targeted, being a little bit more calculated about how we launch, but we're doing so with a view that we are putting experience in the marketplace that will live for many years and drive engagement and profitability for a number of years to come.

Q3 FY '16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and large services that enabled them to play more of the games they love. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter and we are raising our full year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum into the final quarter of the year. 
Our highlights from the holiday quarter capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team at DICE delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for fans of all ages. It became the largest launch ever for a Star Wars game and exceeded our guidance for the full year. 
The journey's just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the 4 expansion packs that come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community. Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in our experiences on mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching a Top 5 Most Downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. 
On PC, our Star Wars: The Old Republic community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly 3 years, driven by the latest digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. More great content is on the way for players in each of these experiences as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company. 
Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving, with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving 2.5x more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we've demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans' unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deeper engagement over time. 
Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices. 
As a top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world's biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the #1 sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the #1 title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire EA SPORTS portfolio, with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing and car culture enthusiasts, with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous games. 
Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged in their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continue to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like FUT Draft in FIFA 16 and Draft Champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continue to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. 
In Q3, our players logged more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay. 
Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow on subscribers, and more than 60% of those players have used EA Access to try games they haven't previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we've just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it's clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games. 
EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA is working to help players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition than ever for our players' time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect to vibrant communities, access more games and content and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. 
In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the",1353,"Thanks, Andrew. 
EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our platform including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. 
Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full year fiscal guidance of 13 million units which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year on year. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter's revenue. It was also a record for the trailing 12-month period which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, FIFA Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year on year or 18% year on year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. 
Finally, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. 
Mobile generated $162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top 3 grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS App Store through the important Christmas period and peaked at #1 on Christmas day. 
To join our broad portfolio of strong portfolio -- or strong portfolio of revenue-generating titles which also include SimCity BuildIt!, Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits and Real Racing 3. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront and offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift giving became the dominant driver of purchases. Note that the revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes, and this revenue will be recognized in our fourth quarter. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth and we launched a similar PC subscription, Origin Access, in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars: The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep storytelling. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year's 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix with Dragon Age: Inquisition last year compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We have factored into guidance, our expectation that Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong gift giving titles, but it's skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. 
The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive: the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down $10 million year on year, driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been $22 million up, driven chiefly by increased investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. 
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance and continued cost management. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter was $3.23 billion or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes. 
During Q3, we settled $95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed $293 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We've updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. 
We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow ever generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 100 -- or $1.025 billion. 
Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, $21 million lower than last year's. The decline is driven by the absence of last year's Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in the game sales for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind. 
Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year's. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year, driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.39 last year. 
Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46 as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. 
I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last 2 years, in the fourth quarter, we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings or cash flow. 
Our Q4 outlook would result in a full year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $0.03 per share, respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. 
Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23 per share. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion, as capital expenditure is tracking below our $100 million estimate for the year. 
Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high watermark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and licensed IP. This builds a deep catalog that sell for years and provide the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

FY '16 has been a groundbreaking year so far for Electronic Arts on so many fronts. Stunning new games, dynamic services and new opportunities to connect and celebrate the passion for play we share with our payers. Amazing game experiences begin with creativity and innovation and we are focused on delivering that to players wherever they want to play. Leveraging the powerful Star Wars IP, we're now connected with players in live services across 3 games on 3 platforms and 3 business models. 
In Star Wars Battlefront, an HD console experience, we are building a major franchise with passionate fans. In Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a free-to-download game on mobile, we have a successful new live service. And in Star Wars : The Old Republic, we've demonstrated the longevity of an experience that has great IP and content that continues to deliver enjoyment for our players. 
In Q4, we will go live with 3 new titles that further reflect the creativity, innovation and variety in our experiences today. Unravel launches on February 9, bringing Yarny's journey to life in the charming and beautiful world crafted by our partners at Colwood Interactive. 
On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 goes live, with all of its over-the-top action and hilarious characters ready for new and existing fans of this beloved franchise. 
Then on March 15, we return to the Octagon with EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut featuring new fighters, new physics and new modes for fight fans around the world. 
Looking ahead to FY '17, we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises. In Q1, we'll begin with a creative and innovative Mirror's Edge Catalysts from DICE launching in May. A great lineup of EA SPORTS titles are in development for next year and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. 
An all new Battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays, we're excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming from our friends at Respawn and of course, Mass Effect Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. 
Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and updates and we'll have more new mobile titles as well. 
Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts and we're thrilled to share the passion with our players through our new Competitive Gaming division, led by Peter Moore. For years, we've experienced the energy of competitive gaming through events and tournaments for our EA SPORTS and Battlefield communities. 
As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competition that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway with players competing in the Madden NFL live challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. We're excited to have Peter and the team unveil more of our plans as we get into FY '17. 
From our new titles to our live services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do. Games deliver on a fundamental human need for entertainment and for each of us, that means something unique and personal. A need to connect to compete, to explore, to improve, to challenge, to share. We are focused on understanding these needs for every player, building strong relationships so we can fulfill them at the right place and time and unlocking the full potential of play through amazing new experiences. 
The commitment we have to our players continues to transform Electronic Arts and galvanizes our efforts to deliver disruptive and innovative new ways to play. 
Now Blake, Peter and I are here for your questions."

This past holiday season, I think we've seen some industry data points that show that AAA launches really inflected higher in terms of digital, but digital downloads are just a bit lighter than we would have expected for you all. And Blake, I know you obviously commented that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season which I think makes a lot of sense, given the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5, are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads? And is 1 point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward? And just a second quick question, I was wondering if you won't mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4? And when we think about the DLCs you'll be selling for that title, is it fair to assume that the attach rate would be comparable to that of Battlefield 4?"

So let me start with the full game download and Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the Battlefield or the Battlefront engagement. First, I'll remind you that full game downloads generated $195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that's still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full game downloads since you couldn't have gotten a number of that size in the quarter without that. We were surprised that more gift giving was done with Star Wars which obviously impacted the digital downloads. And my guess is, is that, that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards gift giving and less -- and more towards PC. There's a very hardcore PC audience, the Battlefield audience and they tend to obviously do more physical or digital downloads than physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin guidance that we've talked about in the past. We'll obviously give you a detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title and gift giving, we would be very surprised if we didn't shift back to the improvements in gross margin that we saw."

This is a business that in the holiday time frame between Black Friday and Christmas has traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume, particularly when people are now buying for the first time, a new console. Often, they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we found the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We obviously share that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that each year with specific programs. And I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that. We're also doing discounting on the digital side to try to keep the 2 aligned. We don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. And so you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year in, year out. I would say this year, our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had. There wasn't a lot of difference between years. On the sales reserve, we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter in anticipation of what our sell in is going to be. And we use those sales reserves during the quarter on a very formalized plan, that's to sell all of these sales get planned well in advance. And we need to make sure that we have the appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those over time. And so we'll be setting up sales reservers each quarter as we go in and those tend not to impact margins or margins that we forecast because they're already built into the numbers."

So what we've seen is really there's 2 groups that have either come for the first title or have come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly, of my generation or my vintage who have been gamers in the past, have for whatever reason, kind of moved away from it, and particularly moved away from core FPS shooters because they've become very hard and complicated and quite frankly, brutal to play online. They have come back in light of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and the passion they have around that from their youth. At the same time, they now have kids who are of gameplaying age, who may not have gotten to the first-person shooting universe yet because of the nature of the content inside of some of those games. And so we're seeing fathers and sons play, we're seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal. And so the big groups that we've added is kind of a youth demographic that skews typically younger than we have seen before as well as an older demographic that we may have had interaction with some years ago but have lapsed out in recent years, particularly from the first-person shooting universe. And we're looking now at how we continue to provide content and experiences that engage those 2 new groups so that we maintain relationships with  them over time."

I don't think there's any indication that this mix shift is anything but a Star Wars Battlefront opportunity. Remember, the movie was out, all things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect gift giving opportunity. And typically with gifts, someone wants to have a package under a tree or in a gift pile somewhere versus a digital code, and that was driver of the shift. We could see, when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing it for ourselves for the industry and exactly how the buzz around Star Wars will be when that comes again the next time around. So right now, I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact, we look at all of our non-Star Wars products, every one of them were up digitally and full game downloads and the digital engagement associated with it. When you look at all to Ultimate Team's statistics we gave you, that's a clear sign that people are playing and engaging longer and longer around the titles. In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we're not going to break out individual guidance. Obviously, we'll end up selling more than the 13 million units since we've already gotten there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell less in the fourth quarter than we originally thought. But we'll clearly sell more overall and that's built into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I will remind people about fourth quarter though, don't forget that there's a continued FX headwind, headwind that we called out, that's $40 million of headwind. I'm not sure everyone's modeling that into their models. And we're not ignoring the fact that there's the economic headwind out there around the world that hasn't really impacted us, but we're being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely. In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along with the traditional sports titles. The one thing to note is Q1, the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror's Edge, plus all of our catalog business and live services business. But our core console title will be Mirror's Edge. And if you're doing -- we'll give you real full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call. But as you're starting to think about guidance for Q1 and next year, don't forget about the continued FX headwinds which are impacting us, as well as in Q1, one specific item, remember that last year in Q1, we had a $30 million benefit, onetime benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue all into Q1. So that was high profit revenue that came into Q1, a couple of basic things for your model but things to remember. But we're excited about the rest of the slate. You should assume that a Battlefield would come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it. We're not yet announcing when Titanfall or Mass Effect: Andromeda will come, but you should assume that's in the back half of the year as well because the second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles."

Our goal is to try to keep R&D expenses around the 22% to 23% of revenue line which means if our revenue's growing, we're clearly continuing to invest in R&D. We think that's very important for our future. You'll see marketing expenses bounce around depending on the title and the quarter. So this quarter, our marketing expenses were up if you FX adjust them. And that was driven by the fact that we had a fairly large title this year that we didn't have in last year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars, obviously, last year, our large title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter. And so you get some of that timing differences, but you'll continue to see general increases in OpEx with a goal to try to target R&D around the 22% to 23%.

So we should continue to see strong growth of Ultimate Team through the year and probably for the full year, clearly exceed because of the lean last quarter last year. But clearly, the business continues to grow and we've done a good job of bringing new users in. So we're not taxing the existing users but it gets harder and harder to grow the business at the size that it's at. So we'll see what it looks like for next year. The other thing to really remember as you're looking at it is realize that a huge portion of the Ultimate Team audience for FIFA is outside the U.S., large markets like France, Germany, U.K. And so all of those markets have a headwind from FX in them that we're clearly seeing in the growth numbers. So as I mentioned today, 18% on a constant currency basis for Ultimate Team or for FIFA, and that's a pretty impressive growth rate on a business of that size."

I think our business seems to be operating pretty consistent as it has been over the last couple of years. The console purchases up through the end of calendar year '15, our estimate is 55 million units out there which has exceeded virtually, everyone's forecast for the year and is now almost 50% higher than the previous console cycle.

Meaning, you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in, because the extent that it's in the future around our current Battlefront game is also based on the historical Star Wars canon which is 30 years before the most recent movie. That will limit our ability to bring some new content into that, but more to come there. Obviously, we're trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies. And we'll obviously, in future Star Wars games, be able to tap the new characters and vehicles and so forth. But in our current game and for that matter, the DLC associated with that current game, obviously, we'll have to be careful that we don't violate the canon.

Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and large services that enabled them to play more of the games they love.

Q3 FY '16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and large services that enabled them to play more of the games they love. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter and we are raising our full year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum into the final quarter of the year. 
Our highlights from the holiday quarter capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team at DICE delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for fans of all ages. It became the largest launch ever for a Star Wars game and exceeded our guidance for the full year. 
The journey's just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the 4 expansion packs that come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community. Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in our experiences on mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching a Top 5 Most Downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. 
On PC, our Star Wars: The Old Republic community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly 3 years, driven by the latest digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. More great content is on the way for players in each of these experiences as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company. 
Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving, with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving 2.5x more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we've demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans' unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deeper engagement over time. 
Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices. 
As a top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world's biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the #1 sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the #1 title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire EA SPORTS portfolio, with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing and car culture enthusiasts, with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous games. 
Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged in their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continue to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like FUT Draft in FIFA 16 and Draft Champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continue to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. 
In Q3, our players logged more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay. 
Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow on subscribers, and more than 60% of those players have used EA Access to try games they haven't previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we've just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it's clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games. 
EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA is working to help players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition than ever for our players' time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect to vibrant communities, access more games and content and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. 
In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our platform including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. 
Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full year fiscal guidance of 13 million units which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year on year. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter's revenue. It was also a record for the trailing 12-month period which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, FIFA Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year on year or 18% year on year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. 
Finally, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. 
Mobile generated $162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top 3 grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS App Store through the important Christmas period and peaked at #1 on Christmas day. 
To join our broad portfolio of strong portfolio -- or strong portfolio of revenue-generating titles which also include SimCity BuildIt!, Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits and Real Racing 3. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront and offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift giving became the dominant driver of purchases. Note that the revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes, and this revenue will be recognized in our fourth quarter. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth and we launched a similar PC subscription, Origin Access, in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars: The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep storytelling. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year's 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix with Dragon Age: Inquisition last year compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We have factored into guidance, our expectation that Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong gift giving titles, but it's skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. 
The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive: the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down $10 million year on year, driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been $22 million up, driven chiefly by increased investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. 
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance and continued cost management. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter was $3.23 billion or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes. 
During Q3, we settled $95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed $293 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We've updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. 
We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow ever generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 100 -- or $1.025 billion. 
Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, $21 million lower than last year's. The decline is driven by the absence of last year's Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in the game sales for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind. 
Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year's. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year, driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.39 last year. 
Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46 as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. 
I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last 2 years, in the fourth quarter, we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings or cash flow. 
Our Q4 outlook would result in a full year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $3 per share, respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. 
Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23 per share. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion, as capital expenditure is tracking below our $100 million estimate for the year. 
Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high watermark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and licensed IP. This builds a deep catalog that sell for years and provides the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

FY '16 has been a groundbreaking year so far for Electronic Arts on so many fronts. Stunning new games, dynamic services and new opportunities to connect and celebrate the passion for play we share with our payers. Amazing game experiences begin with creativity and innovation and we are focused on delivering that to players wherever they want to play. Leveraging the powerful Star Wars IP, we're now connected with players in live services across 3 games on 3 platforms and 3 business models. 
In Star Wars Battlefront, an HD console experience, we are building a major franchise with passionate fans. In Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a free-to-download game on mobile, we have a successful new live service. And in Star Wars : The Old Republic, we've demonstrated the longevity of an experience that has great IP and content that continues to deliver enjoyment for our players. 
In Q4, we will go live with 3 new titles that further reflect the creativity, innovation and variety in our experiences today. Unravel launches on February 9, bringing Yarny's journey to life in the charming and beautiful world crafted by our partners at Colwood Interactive. 
On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 goes live, with all of its over-the-top action and hilarious characters ready for new and existing fans of this beloved franchise. 
Then on March 15, we return to the Octagon with EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut featuring new fighters, new physics and new modes for fight fans around the world. 
Looking ahead to FY '17, we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises. In Q1, we'll begin with a creative and innovative Mirror's Edge Catalysts from DICE launching in May. A great lineup of EA SPORTS titles are in development for next year and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. 
An all new Battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays, we're excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming from our friends at Respawn and of course, Mass Effect Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. 
Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and updates and we'll have more new mobile titles as well. 
Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts and we're thrilled to share the passion with our players through our new Competitive Gaming division, led by Peter Moore. For years, we've experienced the energy of competitive gaming through events and tournaments for our EA SPORTS and Battlefield communities. 
As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competitions that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway with players competing in the Madden NFL live challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. We're excited to have Peter and the team unveil more of our plans as we get into FY '17. 
From our new titles to our live services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do. Games deliver on a fundamental human need for entertainment and for each of us, that means something unique and personal. A need to connect to compete, to explore, to improve, to challenge, to share. We are focused on understanding these needs for every player, building strong relationships so we can fulfill them at the right place and time and unlocking the full potential of play through amazing new experiences. 
The commitment we have to our players continues to transform Electronic Arts and galvanizes our efforts to deliver disruptive and innovative new ways to play.

This past holiday season, I think we've seen some industry data points that show that AAA launches really inflected higher in terms of digital, but digital downloads are just a bit lighter than we would have expected for you all. And Blake, I know you obviously commented that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season which I think makes a lot of sense, given the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5, are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads? And is 1 point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward? And just a second quick question, I was wondering if you won't mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4? And when we think about the DLCs you'll be selling for that title, is it fair to assume that the attach rate would be comparable to that of Battlefield 4?"

So let me start with the full game download and Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the Battlefield or the Battlefront engagement. First, I'll remind you that full game downloads generated $195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that's still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full game downloads since you couldn't have gotten a number of that size in the quarter without that. We were surprised that more gift giving was done with Star Wars which obviously impacted the digital downloads. And my guess is, is that, that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards gift giving and less -- and more towards PC. There's a very hardcore PC audience, the Battlefield audience, and they tend to obviously do more physical or digital downloads than physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin guidance that we've talked about in the past. We'll obviously give you a detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title and gift giving, we would be very surprised if we didn't shift back to the improvements in gross margin that we saw."

As was mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're looking forward to the finals of the Madden Challenge Series at the Madden Bowl on Thursday here in the Bay Area. But we also see this maybe a little bit differently than maybe some of our publishing brethren that are in the marketplace right now. And we see this as a tool and a platform to increase engagement. More and more session days with games is good for Electronic Arts, it's good for our players. We've taken a very player first view on this in which we're building community. It's clearly an entertainment medium. I think there's a lot of excitement around it, and I can't think of anybody that's better served with the diversity of our portfolio when you think of our sports titles in particular, FIFA and Madden as well as our Battlefield franchise have both been able to build a meaningful business over the next couple of years."

This is a business that in the holiday time frame between Black Friday and Christmas has traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume, particularly when people are now buying for the first time, a new console. Often, they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we found the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We obviously share that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that each year with specific programs. And I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that. We're also doing discounting on the digital side to try to keep the 2 aligned. We don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. And so you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year in, year out. I would say this year, our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had. There wasn't a lot of difference between years. On the sales reserve, we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter in anticipation of what our sell in is going to be. And we use those sales reserves during the quarter on a very formalized planned method. So all of these sales get planned well in advance. And we need to make sure that we have the appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those over time. And so we'll be setting up sales reservers each quarter as we go in and those tend not to impact margins or margins that we forecast because they're already built into the numbers."

So what we've seen is really there's 2 groups that have either come for the first title or have come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly, of my generation or my vintage who have been gamers in the past, have for whatever reason, kind of moved away from it, and particularly moved away from core FPS shooters because they've become very hard and complicated and quite frankly, brutal to play online. They have come back in light of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and the passion they have around that from their youth. At the same time, they now have kids who are of gameplaying age, who may not have gotten to the first-person shooting universe yet because of the nature of the content inside of some of those games. And so we're seeing fathers and sons play, we're seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal. And so the big groups that we've added is kind of a youth demographic that skews typically younger than we have seen before as well as an older demographic that we may have had interaction with some years ago but had lapsed out in recent years, particularly from the first-person shooting universe. And we're looking now at how we continue to provide content and experiences that engage those 2 new groups so that we maintain relationships with  them over time."

I don't think there's any indication that this mix shift is anything but a Star Wars Battlefront opportunity. Remember, the movie was out, all things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect gift giving opportunity. And typically with gifts, someone wants to have a package under a tree or in a gift pile somewhere versus a digital code, and that was driver of the shift. We could see, when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing it for ourselves for the industry and exactly how the buzz around Star Wars will be when that comes again the next time around. So right now, I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact, we look at all of our non-Star Wars products, every one of them were up digitally and full game downloads and the digital engagement associated with it. When you look at all to Ultimate Team's statistics we gave you, that's a clear sign that people are playing and engaging longer and longer around the titles. In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we're not going to break out individual guidance. Obviously, we'll end up selling more than the 13 million units since we've already gotten there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell less in the fourth quarter than we originally thought. But we'll clearly sell more overall and that's built into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I will remind people about fourth quarter though, don't forget that there's a continued FX headwind, headwind that we called out, that's $40 million of headwind. I'm not sure everyone's modeling that into their models. And we're not ignoring the fact that there's the economic headwind out there around the world that hasn't really impacted us, but we're being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely. In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along with the traditional sports titles. The one thing to note is Q1, the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror's Edge, plus all of our catalog business and live services business. But our core console title will be Mirror's Edge. And if you're doing -- we'll give you real full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call. But as you're starting to think about guidance for Q1 and next year, don't forget about the continued FX headwinds which are impacting us, as well as in Q1, one specific item, remember that last year in Q1, we had a $30 million benefit, onetime benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue all into Q1. So that was high profit revenue that came into Q1, a couple of basic things for your model but things to remember. But we're excited about the rest of the slate. You should assume that a Battlefield would come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it. We're not yet announcing when Titanfall or Mass Effect: Andromeda will come, but you should assume that's in the back half of the year as well because the second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles."

We think that's very important for our future. You'll see marketing expenses bounce around depending on the title and the quarter. So this quarter, our marketing expenses were up if you FX adjust them. And that was driven by the fact that we had a fairly large title this year that we didn't have in last year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars, obviously, last year, our large title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter.

So we're not taxing the existing users but it gets harder and harder to grow the business at the size that it's at. So we'll see what it looks like for next year.

Secondly, FIFA in China, can you just talk about how meaningfully we should be thinking about that business for FY '17? And then finally, of course, I have to ask another VR question.

You put all that together, I don't think that signals anything negative about the fourth quarter, it signals the way we've been approaching the business and operating the business, and that's what we're going to continue to do. In terms of FIFA Online 3 in China, the key there is we're continuing to see very positive reactions but we also have a very long-term view there. So a continued level that we've talked about, $10 million to $15 million a quarter is still consistent with where we are. And when we give you guys guidance in the May time frame, we'll update that number if it looks like it should be updated.

On the macro environment, we've mentioned a couple of times, our caution because of the macro environment. We have not seen anything in our business or heard anything from other players in the business that would imply any economic slowdown in entertainment software. As I've said, we have a level of conservatism about just the global economy which at some point in time, there's trouble in the global economy, that would impact everybody, probably. I think our business seems to be operating pretty consistent as it has been over the last couple of years. The console purchases up through the end of calendar year '15, our estimate is 55 million units out there which has exceeded virtually, everyone's forecast for the year and is now almost 50% higher than the previous console cycle. So all of that is very, very positive. All of the gameplay we're seeing and the engagement in things like Ultimate Team are seeing as positive. We're just conscious of the fact that there's a lot of storm clouds out there and we want to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves or the economy in our forecast for the business, and that's what you're hearing. The second part of the question was the Amazon issue. We do not fund the Amazon discount, that comes out of Amazon's own pocket. I think that's fairly consistent with how Amazon operates. And we don't have much say or view on pricing of anyone in the marketplace. That's their job, not our job. For us, if it brings new game players into the business, then we're excited, but we don't really have much more to say or control over their pricing strategy."

I don't know, Andrew might want to chime in on the mobile piece. On Star Wars, the one thing that we are adhering to and I think this is part of our arrangement with Lucas and Disney is you can't make a game in Star Wars that violates then canon of Star Wars. Meaning, you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in, because the extent that it's in the future around our current Battlefront game is also based on the historical Star Wars canon which is 30 years before the most recent movie. That will limit our ability to bring some new content into that, but more to come there. Obviously, we're trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies. And we'll obviously, in future Star Wars games, be able to tap the new characters and vehicles and so forth. But in our current game and for that matter, the DLC associated with that current game, obviously, we'll have to be careful that we don't violate the canon. On mobile, obviously, mobile, one thing to remember is, like our console business, mobile will always be a little choppy based on when new titles come out.

Q3 FY '16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and live services that enabled them to play more of the games they love. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter and we are raising our full year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum into the final quarter of the year. 
Our highlights from the holiday quarter capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team at DICE delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for fans of all ages. It became the largest launch ever for a Star Wars game and exceeded our guidance for the full year. 
The journey's just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the 4 expansion packs that come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community. Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in their experiences on mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching a Top 5 Most Downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. 
On PC, our Star Wars: The Old Republic community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly 3 years, driven by the latest digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. More great content is on the way for players in each of these experiences as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company. 
Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving, with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving 2.5x more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we've demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans' unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deeper engagement over time. 
Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices. 
As a top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world's biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the #1 sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the #1 title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire EA SPORTS portfolio, with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing and car culture enthusiasts, with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous games. 
Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged in their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continue to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like FUT Draft in FIFA 16 and Draft Champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continue to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. 
In Q3, our players logged more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay. 
Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow on subscribers, and more than 60% of those players have used EA Access to try games they haven't previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we've just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it's clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games. 
EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA is working to help players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition than ever for our players' time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect to vibrant communities, access more games and content and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. 
In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the",1353,"Thanks, Andrew. 
EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 26% higher than the prior years, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our platform including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. 
Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full year fiscal guidance of 13 million units which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year on year. 
Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter's revenue. It was also a record for the trailing 12-month period which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, FIFA Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year on year or 18% year on year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. 
Finally, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. 
Mobile generated $162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top 3 grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS App Store through the important Christmas period and peaked at #1 on Christmas day. 
To join our broad portfolio of strong portfolio -- or strong portfolio of revenue-generating titles which also include SimCity BuildIt!, Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits and Real Racing 3. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront and offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift giving became the dominant driver of purchases. Note that the revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes, and this revenue will be recognized in our fourth quarter. 
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong sustained growth and we launched a similar PC subscription, Origin Access, in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars: The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep storytelling. 
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year's 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix with Dragon Age: Inquisition last year compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We have factored into guidance, our expectation that Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong gift giving titles, but it's skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. 
The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive: the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down $10 million year on year, driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been $22 million up, driven chiefly by increased investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. 
The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance and continued cost management. 
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter was $3.23 billion or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes. 
During Q3, we settled $95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed $293 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We've updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. 
We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow ever generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 100 -- or $1.025 billion. 
Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, $21 million lower than last year's. The decline is driven by the absence of last year's Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in the game sales for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind. 
Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year's. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year, driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.39 last year. 
Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46 as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. 
I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last 2 years, in the fourth quarter, we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings or cash flow. 
Our Q4 outlook would result in a full year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $3 per share, respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. 
Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23 per share. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion, as capital expenditure is tracking below our $100 million estimate for the year. 
Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high watermark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and licensed IP. This builds a deep catalog that sell for years and provides the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

FY '16 has been a groundbreaking year so far for Electronic Arts on so many fronts. Stunning new games, dynamic services and new opportunities to connect and celebrate the passion for play we share with our players. Amazing game experiences begin with creativity and innovation and we are focused on delivering that to players wherever they want to play. Leveraging the powerful Star Wars IP, we're now connected with players in live services across 3 games on 3 platforms and 3 business models. 
In Star Wars Battlefront, an HD console experience, we are building a major franchise with passionate fans. In Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a free-to-download game on mobile, we have a successful new live service. And in Star Wars : The Old Republic, we've demonstrated the longevity of an experience that has great IP and content that continues to deliver enjoyment for our players. 
In Q4, we will go live with 3 new titles that further reflect the creativity, innovation and variety in our experiences today. Unravel launches on February 9, bringing Yarny's journey to life in the charming and beautiful world crafted by our partners at Colwood Interactive. 
On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 goes live, with all of its over-the-top action and hilarious characters ready for new and existing fans of this beloved franchise. 
Then on March 15, we return to the Octagon with EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut featuring new fighters, new physics and new modes for fight fans around the world. 
Looking ahead to FY '17, we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises. In Q1, we'll begin with a creative and innovative Mirror's Edge Catalysts from DICE launching in May. A great lineup of EA SPORTS titles are in development for next year and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. 
An all new Battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays, we're excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming from our friends at Respawn and of course, Mass Effect Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. 
Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and updates and we'll have more new mobile titles as well. 
Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts and we're thrilled to share the passion with our players through our new Competitive Gaming division, led by Peter Moore. For years, we've experienced the energy of competitive gaming through events and tournaments for our EA SPORTS and Battlefield communities. 
As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competitions that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway with players competing in the Madden NFL live challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. We're excited to have Peter and the team unveil more of our plans as we get into FY '17. 
From our new titles to our live services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do. Games deliver on a fundamental human need for entertainment and for each of us, that means something unique and personal. A need to connect to compete, to explore, to improve, to challenge, to share. We are focused on understanding these needs for every player, building strong relationships so we can fulfill them at the right place and time and unlocking the full potential of play through amazing new experiences. 
The commitment we have to our players continues to transform Electronic Arts and galvanizes our efforts to deliver disruptive and innovative new ways to play. 
Now Blake, Peter and I are here for your questions."

This past holiday season, I think we've seen some industry data points that show that AAA launches really inflected higher in terms of digital, but digital downloads are just a bit lighter than we would have expected for you all. And Blake, I know you obviously commented that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season which I think makes a lot of sense, given the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5, are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads? And is 1 point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward? And just a second quick question, I was wondering if you won't mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4? And when we think about the DLCs you'll be selling for that title, is it fair to assume that the attach rate would be comparable to that of Battlefield 4?"

So let me start with the full game download and Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the Battlefield or the Battlefront engagement. First, I'll remind you that full game downloads generated $195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that's still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full game downloads since you couldn't have gotten a number of that size in the quarter without that. We were surprised that more gift giving was done with Star Wars which obviously impacted the digital downloads. And my guess is, is that, that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards gift giving and less -- and more towards PC. There's a very hardcore PC audience, the Battlefield audience, and they tend to obviously do more physical or digital downloads than physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin guidance that we've talked about in the past. We'll obviously give you a detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title and gift giving, we would be very surprised if we didn't shift back to the improvements in gross margin that we saw."

This is a business that in the holiday time frame between Black Friday and Christmas has traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume, particularly when people are now buying for the first time, a new console. Often, they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we found the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We obviously share that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that each year with specific programs. And I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that. We're also doing discounting on the digital side to try to keep the 2 aligned. We don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. And so you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year in, year out. I would say this year, our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had. There wasn't a lot of difference between years. On the sales reserve, we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter in anticipation of what our sell in is going to be. And we use those sales reserves during the quarter on a very formalized planned method. So all of these sales get planned well in advance. And we need to make sure that we have the appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those over time. And so we'll be setting up sales reserves each quarter as we go in and those tend not to impact margins or margins that we forecast because they're already built into the numbers."

So what we've seen is really there's 2 groups that have either come for the first title or have come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly, of my generation or my vintage who have been gamers in the past, have for whatever reason, kind of moved away from it, and particularly moved away from core FPS shooters because they've become very hard and complicated and quite frankly, brutal to play online. They have come back in light of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and the passion they have around that from their youth. At the same time, they now have kids who are of gameplaying age, who may not have gotten to the first-person shooting universe yet because of the nature of the content inside of some of those games. And so we're seeing fathers and sons play, we're seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal. And so the big groups that we've added is kind of a youth demographic that skews typically younger than we have seen before as well as an older demographic that we may have had interaction with some years ago but had lapsed out in recent years, particularly from the first-person shooting universe. And we're looking now at how we continue to provide content and experiences that engage those 2 new groups so that we maintain relationships with  them over time."

I don't think there's any indication that this mix shift is anything but a Star Wars Battlefront opportunity. Remember, the movie was out, all things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect gift giving opportunity. And typically with gifts, someone wants to have a package under a tree or in a gift pile somewhere versus a digital code, and that was driver of the shift. We could see, when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing yet for ourselves or the industry and exactly how the buzz around Star Wars will be when that comes again the next time around. So right now, I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact, we look at all of our non-Star Wars products, every one of them were up digitally and full game downloads and the digital engagement associated with it. When you look at all to Ultimate Team's statistics we gave you, that's a clear sign that people are playing and engaging longer and longer around the titles. In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we're not going to break out individual guidance. Obviously, we'll end up selling more than the 13 million units since we've already gotten there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell less in the fourth quarter than we originally thought. But we'll clearly sell more overall and that's built into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I will remind people about fourth quarter though, don't forget that there's a continued FX headwind, headwind that we called out, that's $40 million of headwind. I'm not sure everyone's modeling that into their models. And we're not ignoring the fact that there's the economic headwind out there around the world that hasn't really impacted us, but we're being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely. In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along with the traditional sports titles. The one thing to note is Q1, the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror's Edge, plus all of our catalog business and live services business. But our core console title will be Mirror's Edge. And if you're doing -- we'll give you real full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call. But as you're starting to think about guidance for Q1 and next year, don't forget about the continued FX headwinds which are impacting us, as well as in Q1, one specific item, remember that last year in Q1, we had a $30 million benefit, onetime benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue all into Q1. So that was high profit revenue that came into Q1, a couple of basic things for your model but things to remember. But we're excited about the rest of the slate. You should assume that a Battlefield would come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it. We're not yet announcing when Titanfall or Mass Effect: Andromeda will come, but you should assume that's in the back half of the year as well because the second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles."

As we think about all of our mobile games, we really think about them on 4 vectors: discovery, how someone will find the title, whether that's through an App Store or through social representation; on boarding, how someone will get into the title; the gameplay mechanic itself, so actually what you do while you're playing the game; and then how do we run the service that actually surrounds that game to make it new and interesting, fun and dynamic and engaging on a moment-to-moment, day-to-day basis. As we look at what we've done with Madden NFL Mobile over the last couple of years, you'll have seen we've fundamentally overhauled all 4 of those vectors since we first launched Madden on mobile devices. We now believe we have landed in a place that has a game that is very social in nature, has a game that onboards new players in a broad demographic of players, we have a game mechanic that feels right for mobile devices, and our teams are delivering live events that tie to the passion that players have for the real world of the NFL and are very engaging for them on an ongoing basis, both during the weekend games and the week leading up to those games. All of those opportunities present learning for us as we take these types of things to our other sports games in mobile, and we expect to be able to do well in those areas."

Many of those have obviously come in at lower dollar costs. We've tried to report each quarter what the actual dollar costs are and you've seen some continued investment. Our goal is to try to keep R&D expenses around the 22% to 23% of revenue line which means if our revenue's growing, we're clearly continuing to invest in R&D. We think that's very important for our future. You'll see marketing expenses bounce around depending on the title in the quarter. So this quarter, our marketing expenses were up if you FX adjust them. And that was driven by the fact that we had a fairly large title this year that we didn't have in last year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars, obviously, last year, our large title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter. And so you get some of that timing differences, but you'll continue to see general increases in OpEx with a goal to try to target R&D around the 22% to 23%.

Remember, we had a slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team in the fourth quarter last year as we put the price banding in to address the inflation in the marketplace issue that we saw. We are currently forecasting that we'll have a stronger fourth quarter than we did last year because obviously, we've corrected some of those price and coing farming issues. So we should continue to see strong growth of Ultimate Team through the year and probably for the full year, clearly exceed because of the lean last quarter last year. But clearly, the business continues to grow and we've done a good job of bringing new users in. So we're not taxing the existing users but it gets harder and harder to grow the business at the size that it's at. So we'll see what it looks like for next year. The other thing to really remember as you're looking at it is realize that a huge portion of the Ultimate Team audience for FIFA is outside the U.S., large markets like France, Germany, U.K. And so all of those markets have a headwind from FX in them that we're clearly seeing in the growth numbers. So as I mentioned today, 18% on a constant currency basis for Ultimate Team or for FIFA, and that's a pretty impressive growth rate on a business of that size."

Part of -- to do that, part of it is we have to be ruthless that we don't spend a lot of money on smaller titles. We size them correctly but we also want to continue to look for ways to bring new, interesting titles to the market. Look at Unravel, it's a perfect case of that.

Meaning, you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in, because the extent that it's in the future around our current Battlefront game is also based on the historical Star Wars canon which is 30 years before the most recent movie. That will limit our ability to bring some new content into that, but more to come there. Obviously, we're trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies. And we'll obviously, in future Star Wars games, be able to tap the new characters and vehicles and so forth. But in our current game and for that matter, the DLC associated with that current game, obviously, we'll have to be careful that we don't violate the canon.

And we would expect that as more great Star Wars films come out, we would see more great engagement in Star Wars content more broadly, again, not just in Battlefront but in Star Wars : The Old Republic and our mobile game, Galaxy of Heroes. As we think about mobile, just to add to Blake's point, I think he's absolutely right. The one other thing that we would point to is as we look at our mobile portfolio, our titles typically have very long life spans. Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Real Racing 3 have continued to grow over a number of years. And as we think about launching new titles, we're taking a little more time and being a little bit more calculated about how we launch, but we're doing so with a view that we are putting experiences in the marketplace that will live for many years and drive engagement and profitability for a number of years to come. And so as we look at the year to come, as we look at what we've done with Star Wars and Madden and some other titles that are coming down the chute, our expectation is that we're able to grow the overall business with them."

FY '16 was a phenomenal year for Electronic Arts. Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record level and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies and platforms to the games they love and to each other.
To highlight a few examples, we keep up a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts for the extraordinary successful games on console, PC and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year. Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our SIMS 4 player base grew by almost 2/3 throughout the year and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone. In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile.
Engagement is Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional with players spending nearly 2 hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year. And the SIMS FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs left today.
With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth and value. Engagement is critical in today's world where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP and sophisticated services, we continue to build network, global communities for our games where players can connect to more great content and to their friends maximizing the fun every time they play.
As we move into FY '17, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players. Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirrors Age Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat stunning beauty by our frostbite engine. The first of our EA SPORTS title for this year, Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17, arriving Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion and competition. We're also working on a new and engaging way to place into our NBA Live franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead.
In the global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense visual combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from Dice and the response was immediate and extraordinary. That trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first 4 days, a new record for EA and it's now our most like trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety and a gameplay powered by our frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21.
In partnership with the talent team of Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC. The excitement from friends -- the excitement from fans since our official announcement over the game has been outstanding and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA play on June 12.
Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect: Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands, building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring you EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA Live and FIFA franchises to place in FY '17. Friends of our pocket franchise will have new experiences as well with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year. 
Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow and in each dimension, EA is at the leading-edge. In addition to being the #1 publisher in the Western World on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY '16 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to finding new growth opportunities.
Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels with competitions like Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite Engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR. In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends.
Across our studio teams, partnered by [indiscernible] Sport Entertainment and the [indiscernible] Groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA Play will bring players closer to our games and help them share those expenses with the world.
FY '16 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts and we are just getting started. Looking to FY '17 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,323696383,980478,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew.The end of the year is a good point in which to reflect on the progress we've made and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 year",1913,"Thanks, Andrew.
The end of the year is a good point in which to reflect on the progress we've made and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 years ago was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver those results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million.
Digital revenue was now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX and up 26% at constant currency.
Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue. During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again a record.
Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive as do our mobile titles  led by Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $720 million. This resulted in a full year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year.
Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services add to the broad portfolio of EA mobile games, which delivered a consistent and profitable revenue streams.
Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above prior year.
One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses related to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit was $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal '16 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50. But it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million compared to $198 million in prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion and above our raise guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation.
Fiscal '16 capital expenditures were $93 million resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion.
During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of 5- and 10-year investment grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced the $500 million stock repurchase program over and above the 2-year $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchases quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the 2-year program available for repurchases.
For the fiscal year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimated our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares.
During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilutions from these redemptions, the warrants and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming.
We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sport titles of associated live services and the expansion of our mobile business.
The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website. The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to arrive 110 basis points to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal '16. The increase is driven by our new investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre, an extension of our partnership with Respawn, our digital player platform, competitive gaming and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX. This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million.
The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs but not to factor in any potential reduction from our ongoing buyback program.
The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Package growth and other revenue was forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group: Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital download in fiscal '16. For example, downloads of the Madden for all consoles are up 15% year-on-year and we expect this trend to continue.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4 and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%. 
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access and partially offset by the fall off of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71% and operating expenses around $2.31 billion and EPS of $2.53.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities.
Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13-week this year.
Non-GAAP gross margins is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar.
For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30 as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year.
As we look forward towards Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched 2 weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal '16 rather than the usual 1 week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4.
In conclusion, it was a great year for EA with financial and engagement record set across-the-board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends, along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises underdevelopment, to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS and cash flow growth into the future.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

So in terms of the Titanfall Battlefield one question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There's a very broader diverse players who played games in that category who are looking for a little different gameplay motivations. Some people play very quick play, some a little more strategic play, some people want both in different context. The result of that, we still like we're acting a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of gameplay mechanics as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the 2 titles. I feel very confident that we are well-positioned to do very well in that category in the year. Certainly, as you see the reception around Battlefield 1, we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nice, we look forward to showing more with what of those, both of those titles at EA Play in June. As it relates to Madden mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there's really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP, like Star Wars, in the mobile space and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI and just general gameplay mechanics. But perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not get games, the teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day. And we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well-known and well-recognized IP in the industry."

When I took a step back and asked themselves, what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their History classes, I guess, is people road in to World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scale experience. I think what we've shown so far is a small taste of that, and we look forward to spending time and giving people even more information in a deeper look at that as we come into EA play in June."

First, you might diver into this at Analyst Day, but in addition to continued mix shift towards full game downloads and digital add-on content, how do you think about the evolution of revenue mix over the next few years related to subscription, free-to-play, et cetera? I guess, should we anticipate much of a change or will it be kind of primarily a continuation of growth and full game downloads and add-on content that we're seeing today? And then second, regarding past comments that you made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits? In other words, if it appears that it could be tracking towards double-digits through the year, would you push titles in the fiscal '18 in order to manage the growth rate?"

So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And, obviously, based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push of that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business and you'll see that continuing to grow. In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products, where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was the theory of DLCs over time. And that's what made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to probably see some of that as we have different accounting methods, but I think the combination of extra content, subscription should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix. I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of our growth and the combination of mobile, plus extra content subscriptions, is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads, we mentioned we're $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time. On the revenue growth, let me be clear, it's not our aspiration to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to over invest and not deliver the revenue. That's the problem we had historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth because that's how we think about our investment, but we're trying to drive higher revenue growth possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis on the side of the revenue, if we can push the revenue harder or not, and sometimes products get moved based on when those product are ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double-digit, that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe."

But at the same time, try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over last couple of years since the Gen4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from say high the 20s to the mid-30s? We do think that's possible. I think the big issues remain bandwidth, they remain cashless transactions, many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally, as well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support growth of full game downloads.

I mean, I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony's or other console makers plans are. But I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry, both through the holidays and post-holidays. And there's continued aggressive bundling across the industry and I think all of that continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is, there are very few Gen3 titles being still made, most of new titles that we're talking about, as well as the industry's talking, about are Gen4 only. And that is -- will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they resisted because they've had a choice to play game on either Gen3 or Gen4. In terms of any midcycle upgrades once again, I can't predict. But what I can tell you is that, what we've heard publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft shown they've tried to do with some backward compatibility on to older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a midcycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated with what we've said historically with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it because we see like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that is minimized because we've moved towards one single engine Frostbite. And we were's able to port that to whatever platform or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded. In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been historically, that notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something sometime in the year to come. But we are excited about the continued growth of the business are not afraid of the cycle change if that was still to occur."

And a lot of that is driven around the recognition of our brand and our IP and the quality of the experience that comes as part of those brands. As we look forward, certainly you'll see more great from us that are based around the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio, but at the same time, like in our console business in our PC business, we also look at opportunities to develop new IP in the space.

Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record levels and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies and platforms to the games they love and to each other.
To highlight a few examples, we kicked off a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts with extraordinarily successful games on console, PC and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year. Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our Sims 4 player base grew by almost 2/3 throughout the year and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone. 
In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile. Engagement in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional, with players spending nearly 2 hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance, with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year. And the SIMS FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs life-to-date.
With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth and value. Engagement is critical in today's world where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP and sophisticated services, we continue to build network, global communities for our games where players can connect to more great content and to their friends, maximizing the fun every time they play.
As we move into FY '17, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players. Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat rendered in stunning beauty by our Frostbite engine. 
The first of our EA SPORTS titles for this year -- Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17 -- arrive in Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion and competition. We're also working on a new and engaging way to bring players into our NBA Live franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead.
In a global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense visual combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from DICE, and the response was immediate and extraordinary. That trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first 4 days, a new record for EA and it's now our most like trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety in the gameplay powered by our frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21.
In partnership with the talented team at Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC. The excitement from friends -- the excitement from fans since our official announcement over the game has been outstanding, and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA PLAY on June 12.
Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect: Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. 
And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands. Building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring new EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA Live and FIFA franchises to players in FY '17. Fans of our PopCap franchise will have new experiences as well, with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year. 
Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow, and in each dimension, EA is at the leading edge. In addition to being the #1 publisher in the Western World on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY '16 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to pioneer new growth opportunities.
Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels, with competitions like Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR. In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends.
Across our studio teams, partners like Respawn Entertainment, and labs groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA PLAY will bring players closer than ever to our games and help them share those experiences with the world.
FY '16 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts and we are just getting started. Looking to FY '17 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,323696383,980697,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 year",1917,"Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 years ago was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver those results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million.
Digital revenue is now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX and up 26% at constant currency.
Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue. During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again a record.
Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive as do our mobile titles, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. 
EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $712 million. This resulted in a full year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year.
 
Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services adds to the broad portfolio of EA Mobile games, which deliver a consistent and profitable revenue stream.
Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above the prior year.
One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses relative to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit of $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal '16 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50, but it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million compared to $198 million in the prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion and above our raised guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation.
Fiscal '16 capital expenditures were $93 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion.
During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of 5- and 10-year investment grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program over and above the 2-year $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchase this quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the 2-year program available for repurchases.
For the fiscal year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimate that our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares.
During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we have redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total. And as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilutions from these redemptions, the warrants and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current-generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console growth, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming.
We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sport titles and associated live services, and the expansion of our mobile business.
The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website. 
The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise 110 basis points to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal '16. The increase is driven by R&D investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre; an extension of our partnership with Respawn; our digital player platform; competitive gaming; and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX. 
This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million.
The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs but not to factor in any potential reduction from our ongoing buyback program.
The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group: Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital download in fiscal '16 for example, downloads of the Madden for all consoles are up 15% year-on-year, and we expect this trend to continue.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4 and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%. 
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access and partially offset by the falloff of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. 
On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71% and operating expenses around $2.31 billion and EPS of $2.53.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities.
Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13 weeks this year.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products, offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar.
For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. 
GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year, and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30 as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year.
As we look forward towards Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched 2 weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal '16 rather than the usual 1 week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4.
In conclusion, it was a great year for EA, with financial and engagement records set across-the-board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends, along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises underdevelopment, to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS and cash flow growth into the future.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

Across the world, more players are engaging in more games on more platforms across more geographies and business models. Yet as our audience expands, it is evolving as well. The competition for time means there is no room for transient experiences. Players expect more from the games they play and in return, they will spend more time with the games they love.
In a world where discoveries are increasingly difficult and engagement decisions are made every second, connecting players with the right experience when and where they want to play is critical.
In this transforming world, our focus continues to be on meeting and exceeding our players' needs through direct relationships that add value at every turn. Today, Electronic Arts engages hundreds of millions of players -- and in the future, potentially billions -- through great games and live services in our powerful brands, like Battlefield, FIFA, Star Wars, The Sims, Plants vs. Zombies, Mass Effect and more. This portfolio of IP, combined with great talent and robust technology in our underlying platform differentiates EA in our ability to connect players to more games, to more friends and more ways to engage in a global network of play.
It always begins with great games. And in FY '17, we will deliver some of the creative, engaging and biggest experiences to date from Electronic Arts. We also continue to foster and grow thriving communities across our portfolio of live services. Our teams are leveraging technologies like Frostbite to deliver new experiences across more devices. As we evolve our core platform, we are learning more about our players and adding capabilities to unlock greater value for them. New programs, including competitive gaming, will help us reach and connect more players around the world. These are the dimensions of connected players that today's players seek, and Electronic Arts is positioned to lead. 
These are foundational times for the future of games and how we play them. We're excited for FY '17 and beyond and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead.
With that, Blake and I are here for your questions."

I think you called out mid-20% constant currency growth for Ultimate Team, but I was also sort of curious what lift you got from the Star Wars DLC as well? And then, just a second question on non-GAAP gross margins. I think you guided about 100 basis points of margin expansion year-on-year, which is consistent with the long-term guidance. But I was just curious what that assumes for digital downloads as a percentage of total for the year and how the download patterns for Battlefield 1 might differ from Star Wars Battlefront."

The bulk of that, though, is on the components I just mentioned. It really drove outsized performance in the quarter for extra content. In terms of guidance going forward, assumptions around full game downloads, we assume that we're continuing to see growth that we saw in the past year. Industry now is above 30%. I think it's reaching 32%. And we're fairly consistent with that, with some titles, as we mentioned in the script, that are well north of that. Gen4 Madden, for example, was well north of 50% when you look at the full year number, so you're starting to see dramatic movement there. We should see greater improvement next year because we won't have the skewing towards physical that we saw in the Battlefront gift giving that we saw around the holiday. We mentioned it in our last quarter. And that forecast is driven what we're seeing at our uptick, about 110% in gross margin growth year-over-year."

So in terms of the Titanfall Battlefield 1 question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There's a very broad and diverse set of players who play games in that category who are looking to fulfill different gameplay motivations. Some people play very quick play; some a little more strategic play. Some people want both in different context. The result of that, we feel like we actually have a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of gameplay mechanics as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the 2 titles. I feel very confident that we are well positioned to do very well in that category in the year. Certainly, as you see the reception around Battlefield 1, we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nice. We look forward to showing more of both of those titles at EA PLAY in June. As it relates to Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there's really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP, like Star Wars, in the mobile space and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI and just general gameplay mechanics. But perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we're capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not fire-and-forget games. The teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day. And we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well known and well recognized IP in the industry."

They wanted fundamentally new gameplay mechanics with evolution of story, interwoven character storylines, evolution of machinery, evolution of weaponry, a real opportunity to build and grow inside of a battlefield universe. When they took a step back and asked themselves, what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their history classes, I guess, is people rode in to World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scale experience. And I think what we've shown so far is a small taste of that, and we look forward to spending time and giving people even more information and a deeper look at that as we come into EA PLAY in June."

And then second, regarding past comments that you made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits?

So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And, obviously, based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business, and you'll see that continuing to grow. In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products, where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was a series of DLCs over time. And that's what made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to probably see some of that as we have different accounting methods. But I think the combination of extra content and subscription should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix. I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of our growth and the combination of mobile plus extra content and subscriptions is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads, we mentioned worth $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time. On the revenue growth, let me be clear, it's not our aspiration to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to overinvest and not deliver the revenue. That was the problem we had historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth simply because that's how we think about our investment. But we're trying to drive higher revenue growth if possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis on the side of the revenue, if we can push the revenue harder or not, and sometimes products get moved based on when those product are ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double-digit, that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe."

It's a very ripe opportunity for us and we've been able to bring great talent in to try to build out that part of the business. Our new mobile area -- our mobile area with new studios coming on has also been important for us and we'll continue to invest there. And then last, but not least, continuing to build out the platform in which we operate all our games on and we're trying to leverage through that network. It will continue to be a key part of our investment. So you probably see that rough level as a percentage of sales be the focus going forward, which is a combination of the R&D level around 21 to 22, marketing in the 12 to 13 and G&A in the 7% to 8% range."

We often walk the fine line between maintaining the integrity of the [indiscernible] experience with the provision of advertising inside those experiences. Right now, we have ad technology that we are implementing in some of our key mobile titles that is very targeted in nature and we believe is additive to the overall experience in the long term. And players have been responding positively to that. So there is some advertising in FY '17 number. I would expect that as our network continues to grow beyond the hundreds of millions that we have today, that it will become a more meaningful part of our business in the future."

We know that PCs took about 8 years to go from 0 to 75% full game downloads. But there's a lot of differences between the PC business and the console business. We do know that the consumer is very interested in convenience, and we want to have product wherever the consumer wants to shop, be it a retail store or a console. We obviously have great partners in retail. We want to continue to have great partners over time, and so we'll support them with great in-store merchandise and training and support, but at the same time, try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over last couple of years since the Gen4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from, say, the high the 20s to the mid-30s? We do think that's possible. I think the big issues remain bandwidth. They remain cashless transactions. Many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally. As well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support the growth of full game downloads. But we want to allow the consumer to decide. We'll give them opportunities to buy certain things digitally that they may not be able to buy physically, special digital-only offers. But at the end of the day, we really want to make sure we're allowing the consumer to buy the product wherever the consumer wishes to do that and we want to make sure we're there."

We never want to be in a place where there's a belief that we are providing a pay-to-win mechanic inside of one of our games. I think what you've seen from us over the last couple of years is our ability to balance and deliver tremendous value through choice to our player, which is why our extra content line of business has continued to grow healthily. As we look at FY '17, we are forecasting again continued growth in that category. Given that in Battlefield 1, you will see both macro monetization opportunities from us, like maps and large-scale content, as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of gameplay. And then over time, what you will see from us is elements of gameplay that allow gamers to engage and drive and extend [indiscernible] their experience much the way people do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today.

I mean, I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony's or other console makers plans are. I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry, both through the holidays and post-holidays. And there's continued aggressive bundling across the industry. And I think all of that acts to continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is, there are very few Gen3 titles being still made. Most of the new titles that we're talking about as well as the industry is talking about are Gen4 only. And that is -- will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they have resisted because they've had a choice to play game on either Gen3 or Gen4. In terms of any mid-cycle upgrade, once again, I can't predict. But what I can tell you is that, what we've heard, I think, publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft shown, they've tried to do with some backward compatibility on to older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a mid-cycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated, and what we've said historically, with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it because we see like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that is minimized because we've moved towards one single engine, Frostbite. And we're able to port that to whatever platform -- or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded. In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been historically, that the notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something in [indiscernible] or sometime in the year to come. But we're excited about the continued growth of the business and are not afraid of a cycle change if that was to occur."

Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record levels and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies and platforms to the games they love and to each other.
To highlight a few examples, we kicked off a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts with extraordinarily successful games on console, PC and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year. Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our Sims 4 player base grew by almost 2/3 throughout the year and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone. 
In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile. Engagement in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional, with players spending nearly 2 hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance, with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year. And the SIMS FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs life-to-date.
With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth and value. Engagement is critical in today's world where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP and sophisticated services, we continue to build networked global communities for our games where players can connect to more great content and to their friends, maximizing the fun every time they play.
As we move into FY '17, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players. Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat rendered in stunning beauty by our Frostbite engine. 
The first of our EA SPORTS titles for this year, Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17, arrive in Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion and competition. We're also working on a new and engaging way to bring players into our NBA Live franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead.
In a global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense visceral combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from DICE, and the response was immediate and extraordinary. The trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first 4 days, a new record for EA, and it's now our most liked trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety in the gameplay powered by our Frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21.
In partnership with the talented team at Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The excitement from friends -- the excitement from fans since our official announcement over the game has been outstanding, and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA PLAY on June 12.
Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect: Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. 
And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands. Building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring new EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA Live and FIFA franchises to players in FY '17. Fans of our PopCap franchises will have new experiences as well, with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year. 
Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow, and in each dimension, EA is at the leading edge. In addition to being the #1 publisher in the western world on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY '16 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to pioneer new growth opportunities.
Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels, with competitions like Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR. In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends.
Across our studio teams, partners like Respawn Entertainment, and labs groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA PLAY will bring players closer than ever to our games and help them share those experiences with the world.
FY '16 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts, and we are just getting started. Looking to FY '17 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."

Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 years ago was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver these results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million.
Digital revenue is now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX and up 26% at constant currency.
Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue. During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again a record.
Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive as do our mobile titles, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. 
EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $712 million. This resulted in a full year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year.
 
Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services adds to the broad portfolio of EA Mobile games, which deliver a consistent and profitable revenue stream.
Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above prior year.
One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses relative to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit of $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal '16 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50, but it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million compared to $198 million in prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion and above our raised guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation.
Fiscal '16 capital expenditures were $93 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion.
During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of 5- and 10-year investment grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program over and above the 2-year $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchase this quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the 2-year program available for repurchases.
For the fiscal year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimate that our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares.
During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we have redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total. And as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilutions from these redemptions, the warrants and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current-generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console growth, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming.
We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, and the expansion of our mobile business.
The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website. 
The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise 110 basis points to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal '16. The increase is driven by R&D investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre; an extension of our partnership with Respawn; our digital player platform; competitive gaming; and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX. 
This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million.
The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs but not to factor in any potential reduction from our ongoing buyback program.
The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group: Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital download in fiscal '16. For example, downloads of Madden for all consoles are up 50% year-on-year, and we expect this trend to continue.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4 and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%. 
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access and partially offset by the falloff of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. 
On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71% and operating expenses around $2.31 billion and EPS of $2.53.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities.
Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13 weeks this year.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products, offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar.
For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. 
GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year, and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30 as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year.
As we look forward towards Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched 2 weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal '16 rather than the usual 1 week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4.
In conclusion, it was a great year for EA, with financial and engagement records set across-the-board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends, along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises under development, to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS and cash flow growth into the future.

Across the world, more players are engaging in more games on more platforms across more geographies and business models. Yet as our audience expands, it is evolving as well. The competition for time means there is no room for transient experiences. Players today expect more from the games they play and in return, they will spend more time with the games they love.
In a world where discovery is increasingly difficult and engagement decisions are made every second, connecting players with the right experience when and where they want to play is critical.
In this transforming world, our focus continues to be on meeting and exceeding our players' needs through direct relationships that add value at every turn. Today, Electronic Arts engages hundreds of millions of players and in the future, potentially billions, through great games and live services in our powerful brands like Battlefield, FIFA, Star Wars, The Sims, Plants vs. Zombies, Mass Effect and more. This portfolio of IP, combined with great talent and robust technology in our underlying platform differentiates EA in our ability to connect players to more games, to more friends and more ways to engage in a global network of play.
It always begins with great games. And in FY '17, we will deliver some of the creative, engaging and biggest experiences to date from Electronic Arts. We also continue to foster and grow thriving communities across our portfolio of live services. Our teams are leveraging technologies like Frostbite to deliver new experiences across more devices. As we evolve our core platform, we are learning more about our players and adding capabilities to unlock greater value for them. New programs, including competitive gaming, will help us reach and connect more players around the world. These are the dimensions of connected play that today's players seek, and Electronic Arts is positioned to lead. 
These are foundational times for the future of games and how we play them. We're excited for FY '17 and beyond and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead.
With that, Blake and I are here for your questions."

The bulk of that, though, is on the components I just mentioned. It really drove outsized performance in the quarter for extra content. In terms of guidance going forward, assumptions around full game downloads, we assume that we're continually to see growth that we saw in the past year. Industry now is above 30%. I think it's reaching 32%. And we're fairly consistent with that, with some titles, as we mentioned in the script, that are well north of that. Gen4 Madden, for example, was well north of 50% when you look at a full year number, so you're starting to see dramatic movement there. We should see greater improvement next year because we won't have the skewing towards physical that we saw in the Battlefront gift giving that we saw around the holiday and we mentioned in our last quarter. And that forecast has driven what we're seeing in our uptick, about 110% in gross margin growth year-over-year."

So in terms of the Titanfall Battlefield 1 question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There's a very broad and diverse set of players who play games in that category who are looking to fulfill different gameplay motivations. Some people play very quick play, some people a little more strategic play. Some people want both in different context. The result of that is we feel like we actually have a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of gameplay mechanics, as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the 2 titles, and feel very confident that we are well positioned to do very well in that category in the year. Certainly, as you see the reception around Battlefield 1, we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nicely, and we look forward to showing more of both of those titles at EA PLAY in June. As it relates to Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there's really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP, like Star Wars, in the mobile space and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI and just general gameplay mechanics. But perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we're capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not fire-and-forget games. The teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day. And we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well-known and well recognized IP in the industry."

When they took a step back and asked themselves, what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their history classes, I guess, is that people rode in to World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scale experience.

So they'll get a chance to experience the game. But at the same time, obviously, the attach won't be anywhere near as high as it was because it was one of the first AAA titles for the new Xbox One.

First, you might dive into this at the Analyst Day, but in addition to continued mix shift towards full game downloads and digital add-on content, how do you think about the evolution of revenue mix over the next few years related to subscription, free-to-play, et cetera? I guess, should we anticipate much of a change or will it be kind of primarily a continuation of growth and full game downloads and add-on content that we're seeing today? And then second, regarding past comments that you made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits? In other words, if it appears that it could be tracking towards double-digits partway through the year, would you push titles into fiscal '18 in order to manage the growth rate?"

So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And, obviously, based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business, and you'll see that continue to grow. In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products, where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was a series of DLCs over time. And that's what made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to, probably, see some of that as we have different accounting methods. But I think the combination of extra content and subscription should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix. I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of growth. And the combination of mobile plus extra content and subscriptions is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads we mentioned worth $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time. On the revenue growth, let me be clear, it's not our aspiration to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to overinvest and not deliver the revenue. That was the problem we had, historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth simply because that's how we think about our investment. But we're trying to drive higher revenue growth if possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis and decide if the revenue -- if we can push the revenue harder or not, and sometimes products get moved based on when those product are ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double-digits that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth, and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe."

So obviously, in a bigger revenue year like this year, we're going to spend more on marketing and sales to support things like Battlefield and Titanfall. So that's going to see a flux up and down based on the revenue component. Our R&D expenses, we've tried to target around 21% to 22% of revenue, and we're tracking around that level now. And we feel like there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to invest in new areas of the business, like the action genre, where we haven't competed, historically. It's a very ripe opportunity for us, and we've been able to bring great talent in to try to build out that part of the business. Our new mobile area -- our mobile area with new studios coming on has also been important for us, and we'll continue to invest there. And then last, but not least, continuing to build out the platform in which we operate all our games on and we're trying to leverage through that network.

We know that PCs took about 8 years to go from 0 to 75% in full game downloads. But there's a lot of differences between the PC business and the console business. We do know that the consumer is very interested in convenience, and we want to have product wherever the consumer wants to shop, be it a retail store or a console. We obviously have great partners in retail, and we want to continue to have great partners over time. And so we'll support them with great in-store merchandise and training and support, but at the same time, try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over last couple of years since the Gen4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from, say, the high 20s to the mid-30s? We do think that's possible. I think the big issues remain bandwidth. They remain cashless transactions. Many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally. As well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support the growth of full game downloads. But we want to allow the consumer to decide. We'll give them opportunities to buy certain things digitally that they may not be able to buy physically, special digital-only offers.

As we look at FY '17, we are forecasting, again, continued growth in that category. Given that in Battlefield 1, you will see both macro monetization opportunities from us, like maps and large-scale content, as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of gameplay. And then over time, what you will see from us is elements of gameplay that allow gamers to engage and drive and extend and enhance their experience much the way people do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today.

I mean, I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony's or other console makers plans are. I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry, both through the holidays and post-holidays. And there's continued aggressive bundling across the industry. And I think all of that acts to continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is, there are very few Gen3 titles being still made. Most of the new titles that we're talking about as well as the industry is talking about are Gen4 only. And that is a -- will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they have resisted because they've had a choice to play a game on either Gen3 or Gen4. In terms of any mid-cycle upgrade, once again, I can't predict. But what I can tell you is, is that what we've heard, I think, publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft's shown, they've tried to do with some backward compatibility onto older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a mid-cycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated with what we've said historically with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it because we feel like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that's been minimized because we've moved towards one single engine, Frostbite. And we're able to port that to whatever platform -- or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded. In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been, historically, that the notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something at E3 or sometime in the year to come. But we're excited about the continued growth in the business and not afraid of a cycle change if that was to occur."

Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record levels and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies and platforms to the games they love and to each other.
To highlight a few examples, we kicked off a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts with extraordinarily successful games on console, PC and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year. Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our Sims 4 player base grew by almost 2/3 throughout the year and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone. 
In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile. Engagement in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional, with players spending nearly 2 hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance, with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year. And the SIMS FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs life-to-date.
With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth and value. Engagement is critical in today's world where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP and sophisticated services, we continue to build networked global communities for our games where players can connect to more great content and to their friends, maximizing the fun every time they play.
As we move into FY '17, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players. Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat rendered in stunning beauty by our Frostbite engine. 
The first of our EA SPORTS titles for this year, Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17, arrive in Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion and competition. We're also working on a new and engaging way to bring players into our NBA Live franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead.
In a global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense visceral combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from DICE, and the response was immediate and extraordinary. The trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first 4 days, a new record for EA, and it's now our most liked trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety in the gameplay powered by our Frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21.
In partnership with the talented team at Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The excitement from friends -- the excitement from fans since our official announcement over the game has been outstanding, and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA PLAY on June 12.
Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect: Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. 
And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands. Building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring new EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA Live and FIFA franchises to players in FY '17. Fans of our PopCap franchises will have new experiences as well, with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year. 
Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow, and in each dimension, EA is at the leading edge. In addition to being the #1 publisher in the western world on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY '16 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to pioneer new growth opportunities.
Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels, with competitions like Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR. In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends.
Across our studio teams, partners like Respawn Entertainment, and labs groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA PLAY will bring players closer than ever to our games and help them share those experiences with the world.
FY '16 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts, and we are just getting started. Looking to FY '17 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials."
27963,323696383,981737,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 year",1915,"Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin at just 9.5% 4 years ago was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver these results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million.
Digital revenue is now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX and up 26% at constant currency.
Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue. During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again a record.
Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive as do our mobile titles, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. 
EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $712 million. This resulted in a full year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion.
Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year.
 
Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services adds to the broad portfolio of EA Mobile games, which deliver a consistent and profitable revenue stream.
Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year.
And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year.
Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal '15.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above prior year.
One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses relative to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit of $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal '16 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50, but it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million compared to $198 million in prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion and above our raised guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation.
Fiscal '16 capital expenditures were $93 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion.
During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of 5- and 10-year investment grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program over and above the 2-year $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchase this quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the 2-year program available for repurchases.
For the fiscal year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimate that our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares.
During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we have redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total. And as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilutions from these redemptions, the warrants and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S.
Now on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current-generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console growth, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming.
We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, and the expansion of our mobile business.
The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website. 
The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise 110 basis points to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal '16. The increase is driven by R&D investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre; an extension of our partnership with Respawn; our digital player platform; competitive gaming; and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX. 
This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million.
The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs but not to factor in any potential reduction from our ongoing buyback program.
The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.
Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see the contributions from each group: Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles.
Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital download in fiscal '16. For example, downloads of Madden for all consoles are up 50% year-on-year, and we expect this trend to continue.
Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4 and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%. 
Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access and partially offset by the falloff of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. 
On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71% and operating expenses around $2.31 billion and EPS of $2.53.
Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities.
Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13 weeks this year.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products, offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar.
For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. 
GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year, and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30 as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year.
As we look forward towards Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched 2 weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal '16 rather than the usual 1 week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4.
In conclusion, it was a great year for EA, with financial and engagement records set across-the-board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends, along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises under development, to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS and cash flow growth into the future.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

Across the world, more players are engaging in more games on more platforms across more geographies and business models. Yet as our audience expands, it is evolving as well. The competition for time means there is no room for transient experiences. Players today expect more from the games they play and in return, they will spend more time with the games they love.
In a world where discovery is increasingly difficult and engagement decisions are made every second, connecting players with the right experience when and where they want to play is critical.
In this transforming world, our focus continues to be on meeting and exceeding our players' needs through direct relationships that add value at every turn. Today, Electronic Arts engages hundreds of millions of players and in the future, potentially billions, through great games and live services in our powerful brands like Battlefield, FIFA, Star Wars, The Sims, Plants vs. Zombies, Mass Effect and more. This portfolio of IP, combined with great talent and robust technology in our underlying platform differentiates EA in our ability to connect players to more games, to more friends and more ways to engage in a global network of play.
It always begins with great games. And in FY '17, we will deliver some of the creative, engaging and biggest experiences to date from Electronic Arts. We also continue to foster and grow thriving communities across our portfolio of live services. Our teams are leveraging technologies like Frostbite to deliver new experiences across more devices. As we evolve our core platform, we are learning more about our players and adding capabilities to unlock greater value for them. New programs, including competitive gaming, will help us reach and connect more players around the world. These are the dimensions of connected play that today's players seek, and Electronic Arts is positioned to lead. 
These are foundational times for the future of games and how we play them. We're excited for FY '17 and beyond and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead.
With that, Blake and I are here for your questions."

The bulk of that, though, is on the components I just mentioned. It really drove outsized performance in the quarter for extra content. In terms of guidance going forward, assumptions around full game downloads, we assume that we're continually to see growth that we saw in the past year. Industry now is above 30%. I think it's reaching 32%. And we're fairly consistent with that, with some titles, as we mentioned in the script, that are well north of that. Gen4 Madden, for example, was well north of 50% when you look at a full year number, so you're starting to see dramatic movement there. We should see greater improvement next year because we won't have the skewing towards physical that we saw in the Battlefront gift giving that we saw around the holiday and we mentioned in our last quarter. And that forecast has driven what we're seeing in our uptick, about 110% in gross margin growth year-over-year."

So in terms of the Titanfall Battlefield 1 question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There's a very broad and diverse set of players who play games in that category who are looking to fulfill different gameplay motivations. Some people play very quick play, some people a little more strategic play. Some people want both in different context. The result of that is we feel like we actually have a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of gameplay mechanics, as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the 2 titles, and feel very confident that we are well positioned to do very well in that category in the year. Certainly, as you see the reception around Battlefield 1, we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nicely, and we look forward to showing more of both of those titles at EA PLAY in June. As it relates to Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there's really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP, like Star Wars, in the mobile space and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI and just general gameplay mechanics. But perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we're capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not fire-and-forget games. The teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day. And we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well-known and well recognized IP in the industry."

I think it's a great question and, certainly, one that we've been asked a number of times. When the team set out to deliver the next version of Battlefield, they wanted to do a lot of things with the game. They wanted it to be biggest Battlefield game. They wanted it to be the most diverse Battlefield game. They wanted, fundamentally, new gameplay mechanics with evolution of story, interwoven characters, storylines, evolution of machinery, evolution of weaponry, a real opportunity to build and grow inside of a battlefield universe. When they took a step back and asked themselves, what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their history classes, I guess, is that people rode in to World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scale experience. And I think what we've shown so far is a small taste of that, and we look forward to spending time and giving people even more information and a deeper look at that as we come into EA PLAY in June."

They were asking us to include them in the franchise, and we felt that they could add a huge amount to a new title there. So the cadence should be at least every year along with the cadence of the large and small movies that Disney is doing relative to -- or side movies that Disney is doing relative to Star Wars. And then, obviously, we'll continue to layer in mobile titles where possible as well, to try to have a diverse Star Wars activity from shooters all the way through action and strategy.

First, you might dive into this at the Analyst Day, but in addition to continued mix shift towards full game downloads and digital add-on content, how do you think about the evolution of revenue mix over the next few years related to subscription, free-to-play, et cetera? I guess, should we anticipate much of a change or will it be kind of primarily a continuation of growth and full game downloads and add-on content that we're seeing today? And then second, regarding past comments that you made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits? In other words, if it appears that it could be tracking towards double-digits partway through the year, would you push titles into fiscal '18 in order to manage the growth rate?"

So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And, obviously, based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business, and you'll see that continue to grow. In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products, where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was a series of DLCs over time. And that's what made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to, probably, see some of that as we have different accounting methods. But I think the combination of extra content and subscription should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix. I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of growth. And the combination of mobile plus extra content and subscriptions is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads we mentioned worth $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time. On the revenue growth, let me be clear, it's not our aspiration to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to overinvest and not deliver the revenue. That was the problem we had, historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth simply because that's how we think about our investment. But we're trying to drive higher revenue growth if possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis and decide if the revenue -- if we can push the revenue harder or not, and sometimes products get moved based on when those product are ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double-digits that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth, and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe."

So obviously, in a bigger revenue year like this year, we're going to spend more on marketing and sales to support things like Battlefield and Titanfall. So that's going to see a flux up and down based on the revenue component. Our R&D expenses, we've tried to target around 21% to 22% of revenue, and we're tracking around that level now. And we feel like there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to invest in new areas of the business, like the action genre, where we haven't competed, historically.

We obviously have great partners in retail, and we want to continue to have great partners over time. And so we'll support them with great in-store merchandise and training and support, but at the same time, try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over last couple of years since the Gen4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from, say, the high 20s to the mid-30s? We do think that's possible. I think the big issues remain bandwidth. They remain cashless transactions. Many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally. As well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support the growth of full game downloads. But we want to allow the consumer to decide. We'll give them opportunities to buy certain things digitally that they may not be able to buy physically, special digital-only offers.

And then I realize, obviously, you can't announce any new hardware plans from your partners, but there's been a sort of wide speculation that you could have a mid-cycle upgrade coming.

I mean, I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony's or other console makers plans are. I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry, both through the holidays and post-holidays. And there's continued aggressive bundling across the industry. And I think all of that acts to continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is, there are very few Gen3 titles being still made. Most of the new titles that we're talking about as well as the industry is talking about are Gen4 only. And that is a -- will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they have resisted because they've had a choice to play a game on either Gen3 or Gen4. In terms of any mid-cycle upgrade, once again, I can't predict. But what I can tell you is, is that what we've heard, I think, publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft's shown, they've tried to do with some backward compatibility onto older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a mid-cycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated with what we've said historically with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it because we feel like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that's been minimized because we've moved towards one single engine, Frostbite. And we're able to port that to whatever platform -- or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded. In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been, historically, that the notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something at E3 or sometime in the year to come. But we're excited about the continued growth in the business and not afraid of a cycle change if that was to occur."

As it relates to mobile, again when you have the benefit of the depth and breadth of our portfolio of great brands and IP, in a world where discovery is becoming challenged and the mobile market is increasingly fought with competition, utilization of those brands is certainly a great strength for us. And as you heard us in our prepared comments, we had the most installs of any publisher in calendar year 2015, and a lot of that is driven around the recognition of our brand and our IP and the quality of the experiences that come as part of those brands. As we look forward, certainly you will see more great experience from us that are based around the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio. But at the same time, like in our console business and our PC business, we also look at opportunities to develop new IP in the space. And so you would expect from us, in the future, a balanced approach to the marketplace. But certainly, we're not turning our back on our existing portfolio."

Our first quarter was an excellent start to fiscal year 2017, demonstrating how our digital transformation continues to strengthen and drive growth for Electronic Arts. Revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance as players engage deeply with their favorite games and connected with each other across our global network of live services. On HD platforms, we have thriving communities in our major franchises and each will continue to grow as we introduce great new experiences this year. More than 11.5 million people played our Battlefield 4 [ph] during Q1 and more than 6.6 million played Star Wars Battlefront, 2 examples that illustrate how great games continue to engage players over time.
Looking ahead, there is tremendous excitement for both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, a combination that we believe will bring vitality and innovation to the huge first-person shooter audience. The community has been electrified by Battlefield 1's modern take on Mobile 1, delivering strategy, team play and epic scale in a completely new setting. Titanfall 2 is bringing the game signature pilot and tighten combat to a new single player campaign and its fast and fluid multiplayer led it to win the Best Online Multiplayer award from the E3 Game Critics. These 2 titles are driving the variety, progression and first new experiences that players want, and we believe they will be an unstoppable pairing during the holiday quarter.
Our EA SPORTS [indiscernible] console are also seeing massive engagement, and players will be thrilled with the new ways to play in this year's games. Unique players in Madden NFL grew 20% in Q1 over last year's game, and current and new fans alike will love Madden NFL 17's redesigned franchise med and new competitive tournament, the Madden NFL 17 championship series. In our feature franchise, millions of soccer fans continue to engage daily with FIFA ultimate team, and this year will deliver our first-ever story mode in FIFA 17. 
Powered by our Frostbite engine, story mode adds entirely new dimension to the FIFA experience that has fans incredibly excited. And perennial fan favorite NHL 17 will have hockey fans show their national pride through the all-new World Cup of hockey mode.
In our mobile business, we are seeing growth across multiple genres. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes  players played nearly 2.5 hours per day on average i n the game, reflecting how much players continue to enjoy the RPG style combat and engagement in the events. 
In the sports genre, our EA SPORTS mobile continue to gain momentum and connect with even more passionate fans. Madden NFL Mobile had 25% more monthly active players in Q1 year-over-year and 37 more game session in the same period. We had continued to invest in great experiences for sports fans across the globe. Our new Madden NFL Mobile season is coming soon. NBA Live Mobile just launched on iOS and Android, and hit #1 on the U.S. App Store free download chart, and we have a new FIFA will game coming later this year. With our focus on groundbreaking new games, dynamic digital experiences and deeper player relationships, EA is innovating to lead our industry. 
A new EA play event in June was built on these same principles, inviting our players in and join beyond the typical format to drive a global conversation. Nearly 9,000 fans joined us in Los Angeles and London and millions more connected online to dive deeper into our upcoming games. We live streamed more than 20 hours of gameplay and competitive gaming events, and more importantly, hundreds of community influencers captured more than 1,400 hours of content from our games to share with the community.
Feedback from players who got hands on a EA PLAY was very positive. And more than ever, we are fulfilling the needs of our players and content creators that connect by sharing great experiences in the games they love to play. We're off to a strong start for Q1, and the year ahead is going to be an exciting one for our players for Electronic Arts and for our industry.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

As we discussed on our July 19 call, the SEC has issued new interpretations that no longer permit the use of non-GAAP measures that adjust for revenue deferrals into and out of the quarter. As well as revenue, we've historical adjusted many non-GAAP financial measures for the effect of revenue deferrals, including gross margin and EPS. This is the last call in which we'll report these non-GAAP measures. However, since our board and management team will continue to use these measures internally to manage the business, we will continue to provide the financial data to allow you to compare our results to our historically reported non-GAAP financials. For more information on this, please see the documents we posted on our Investor Relations website following our July 19 call.
Now onto the quarter. Q1 beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from ultimate team and our mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.271 billion. This benefited from a change in deferred net revenue of $589 million, resulting in a non-GAAP net revenue of $682 million, well above our guidance of $640 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP net revenue is always the sum of GAAP net revenue and the change in different net revenue. The change this quarter is negative, thus non-GAAP revenue is smaller than GAAP net revenue this quarter. See our earnings documents in July 19 information -- or for more information.
GAAP revenue is up year-on-year driven by deferrals of Star Wars Battlefront revenue from Q3 fiscal 2016. The underlying business is down slightly year-on-year but remember, the year-ago quarter benefited from strong catalog sales of Battlefield hardline, which launched 2 weeks before the beginning of the quarter. Last year's quarter also included an extra week and one-off record -- revenue recognition of the $31 million for FIFA Online 3 in China. 
I'll note here on quarterly comparisons in a GAAP-only reporting environment. Because GAAP revenue is built from a portion of the sales from the quarter plus some of the sales from each of the previous 3 quarters, a simple year-on-year comparison doesn't reveal much about the dynamics of the underlying business. Because of this, we will restrict ourselves to qualitative comparisons. We will continue to report all the financial data we use internally to adjust our GAAP financials so you may derive comparable measures for yourself. We're also consider adding other metrics that might be used to quantify business trends. We will continue to focus on our most important financial metric, operating cash flow. Our trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, a record for the period. Capital expenditures for the 12 months were $109 million, delivering a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $937 million.
Our GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter was $689 million, benefiting from a change in deferred revenues of $121 million, resulting in $568 million on a non-GAAP basis. Digital continues to grow as a percentage of the business, and this quarter marked a new high. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components, highlights, performance of each of these businesses this quarter.
Extra content and free to play contributed $300 million to GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $42 million, thus non-GAAP net revenue was $258 million. As mentioned earlier, the year-ago quarter had a one-off benefit of $31 million from FIFA Online 3 in China. Underlying growth was strong as FIFA ultimate team benefited from the heightened interest in soccer, driven by the euros and CopaAmerica. FIFA Online 3 continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.
Mobile is up strongly year-on-year, driven by the strength of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Mobile generated $165 million in GAAP net revenue in the quarter, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $24 million. Thus non-GAAP net revenue was $141 million. Note that under GAAP rules, online-enabled content for mobile games, including in-game currencies, is also recognized ratably over service period. Full game PC and console downloads generated $137 million of GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred revenue of $53 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $84 million.
Digital downloads were high in the quarter as expected for a period dominated by catalog sales. Sales growth year-on-year was flat due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline in Q1 last year. We continue to anticipate that the proportion of games bought digitally will increase by about 5 percentage points this year.
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $87 million to GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP was $85 million. The underlying business was up, supported by the growth in subscriptions for EA Access and origin access.
Moving on to gross profit. Our GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a gross margin of 85.9%. Remember that GAAP revenue, particularly in Q1, is driven by revenue deferred from prior quarters, whereas costs of goods sold is driven by the volume of sales actually in Q1. You can, therefore, expect to see some volatility in the quarterly non-GAAP gross margin as we move through the year. 
GAAP cost of goods sold was $179 million, which included $13 million of amortization of intangibles and $1 million of stock-based compensation. Therefore, non-GAAP COGS was $165 million and non-GAAP gross profit was $517 million, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 75.8%. This was down 1 percentage points year-on-year because of the extra FIFA Online 3 revenue recognized in Q1 fiscal '16.
GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $532 million, including $47 million of stock-based compensation and $2 million of amortization of intangibles. Thus, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $483 million. Currency movements actually added to expenses this quarter, as rates were higher from most of the quarter than when we gave guidance, although the British pound in particular fell at the end of the period. Despite the unexpected currency headwinds, underlying expenses were down year-on-year.
The resulting GAAP diluted EPS was $1.40 per share. Adjustments required to provide the non-GAAP EPS include: The $589 million change in deferred net revenue, $15 million of amortization of intangibles, $48 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and costs of goods sold, debt-related expenses of $2 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% and a reduction of 2 million shares for the convertible bond hedge, which is not included in the GAAP share count. See the example we posted for Q4 fiscal 2016 following our July 19 call for details on how to apply these to derive the non-GAAP EPS.
Non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.07 and $0.12 better than our guidance. Outperformance in our digital business drove both top line and profitability higher than we had anticipated this quarter.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.427 billion. 48% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. During Q1, we settled 27 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. We completed repayment of the remaining notes in July. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway is that our diluted share count, whether expressed as GAAP or non-GAAP, already includes the potential dilution at the current share price. 
We also repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $129 million, leaving $410 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. This is typical for a first quarter. The year-ago quarter was atypical in that it had substantial collections from Battlefield hardline sales. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $1.05 billion.
I wanted to take a moment away from our quarterly results to discuss our FX hedging program in a broader context. We run a global basis with roughly half our revenue coming from outside the U.S. Volatility in exchange rates is still very high by historical standards and macro economic events like the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union are injecting even more uncertainty into the system. A comprehensive hedging program is important in ordinary times, but the extraordinary events of the last year or so made it critical. Our hedging program has 2 components: One, to reduce volatility in the P&L; and a second that does the same for the balance sheet.
The first is designed to hedge anticipated revenue and expenses across 7 of EA's largest foreign currency exposures. Combined, these 7 currencies represent approximately 70% of our non-U.S. dollar operating income. We hedge with forward contracts up to 18 months out.
The second covers FX exposure to net monetary assets and liabilities, including third-party accounts receivable and payables as well as intercompany balances. This program aims for 100% coverage of 17 currencies, which account for about 90% of EA's non-U.S. dollar net monetary exposure. We had the swaps and forward contracts that generally have a maturity of 3 months or less. Together, these programs are designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on our business.
Turning to guidance. We're excited about the expanded franchise mode in Madden NFL 17 and by the FIFA story mode powered by Frostbite. We expect our second quarter GAAP net revenue to be $915 million. This includes a headwind from the anticipated change in deferred net revenue of $160 million. Note that this is an increase in deferred net revenue. Thus, we expect the non-GAAP measures we would have reported under our previous approach to be higher than the GAAP net revenue in Q2. In other words, you need to add GAAP revenue of $915 million to deferred net revenue of $160 million to arrive at a comparable non-GAAP numbers in your model.
With regards to year-on-year comparison, remember, FIFA 17 will launch 4 days before the end of the quarter as opposed to the 11 days FIFA 16 had in the quarter last year. This means very little of the digital revenue associated with FIFA 17 for full game downloads and FIFA ultimate team can be recognized in the quarter. We estimate that absent changes in deferred revenue, about $75 million of high margin, mostly digital sales are pushed into Q3. We anticipate a currency headwind to a year-on-year comparisons -- to add to year-on-year comparisons, and this is factored into our outlook for revenue and change in deferred revenue. Our expectations of currency impact on the whole year have not changed.
Cost of goods sold during the quarter is expected to be $405 million, including $13 million of amortization of intangibles. Rather than guide GAAP gross margins, which can be highly volatile from quarter-to-quarter due to revenue deferrals, we believe that guiding COGS will give you a better insight into our business. With GAAP net revenue, the change in deferred net revenue and COGS, you can calculate both GAAP gross margins and a gross margin comparable to the non-GAAP measures we have given in the past. We expect our Q2 GAAP operating expenses to be $566 million, including about $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in amortization of intangibles. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. This results in a GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.17.
As mentioned earlier, this is driven by costs associated with the major sports launches being recognized within the quarter, but much of the revenue being deferred out of the quarter. Adjustments requited arrive the non-GAAP EPS include the $160 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and COGS, $14 million in amortization of intangibles and a reduction of 2 million shares from the convertible bond hedge. Debt-related expenses are expected to be below $1 million this quarter.
With regards to the underlying business, we would expect it to be down slightly year-on-year, driven by the roughly $75 million of FIFA sales that has moved to Q3.
We are not changing our annual outlook for revenue and net income at this time. EA PLAY and the response of E3 was very positive, but it's too early to attempt to extrapolate from that to full year result, particularly in a fiscal year that is expected to be so back-end loaded. We are updating our GAAP diluted share count for the year to 316 million, primarily based on the repurchase activity in the first quarter. This increases the GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to $2.56 for the year. It remains our practice to not factor in potential repurchases into our forecasted share count for the full year.
Regarding cash flow for the full year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.2 billion. The ongoing strength of our live services and the reception to our upcoming launches bodes well for the rest of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

And it's been be a very popular and the feedback has been extremely strong. We tend to try to rate guidance too early in the year. We would like to see a little more demand metrics in all of our, products particularly Battlefield and Titanfall, before we make that decision. Gamescom is a very important piece that's coming up in a couple of weeks in Europe. And then obviously, the potential for beta is around those products will help us derive better demand metrics. Last year, if you remember, we did raise guidance coming out of the first quarter because our initial forecasts on Battlefront, the Star Wars title, is relatively low, and we moved that up. We've got a fairly normal forecast for Battlefield and Titanfall, so we're not moving those yet, but we're still super optimistic about the titles and we're excited so more to come in the future. But we felt it was just too early in the year to try to make guidance on any other titles going forward. On the share count piece, we have been over time bringing down stock-based compensation. It was an important part of the overall compensation. We think it's important as part of our employees and executives to bear some of the risks of the stockholders and making -- having your conversation as part of that is critical. But we also recognized that we need to bring all compensation down over time to continue to be -- to be profitable as a company. We balance that with the requirements of attracting the greatest people that we can in the industry and we feel like that mixes a pretty good mix today. But we will obviously be trying to drive down the share count between a combination of aggressive buybacks as well as prudent management of our overall compensation pool."

We continue to believe that we'll see upside in the number of consoles sold this year and the software attach rates stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen up through the cycle so far. So all that I think bodes well for the overall cycle and should continue to help us drive upside. Now on the revenue growth, the numbers I laid out at the Analyst Day were basically, if you take our year-end fiscal 2016 results and you look out over the 2020 to '22 timeframe, we believe that we could add another $1.5 billion of revenue from areas such as genre growth moving into the action genre, continuing to grow our mobile business, continuing to grow our business in Asia and other parts of the emerging markets around the world. And we believe that could then continue to drive free cash flow growth and earnings growth, and $1.5 billion of additional revenue should be able to drive $1 billion in operating income and just under $1 billion in free cash flow growth during that time.

We think that's very sustainable because you're able to continue to add activities. In the sports world, it works well because you're dealing with the real world sports over time.

As it relates to Pokemon Go, great question. First, as a comment, I think that with that team has done is very, very strong.

We have made some announcements around VR in mobile and on console with PlayStation VR, and we're going to continue to invest there. As you can imagine, we are energized by the success of Pokemon Go. We have tremendously strong brands that are unbelievably social in nature where we believe that a participation in the community level through AR will just tighten the experience.

The reality for us is, again, in a network world, liquidity of play is really, really important. And what we've seen over the last decade or more with respect to PC gamers is that community continue to grow and it's growing in a world where the hardware refresh cycle has been disconnected from a software refresh cycle. And what that meant is irrespective of what kind of device you have within kind of a 7- to 10-year time frame, you're able to play with a much, much bigger global community. What we see now with the things that we've talked about with a mid-cycle refresh is that's only going to enhance the size and engagement level inside the communities. For us as a publisher, we're in a very strong place. We've been building across platform and across console and to scalable architectures like PC for sometime. So the notion that we would build once and experience it in scale up and down across an entire spectrum of consoles, whether the first phase, the second phase or the third phase overtime, is not something that's foreign to us and something that we're very energized about because again, I think we have strength in a networked world. We have strength where there's a requirement to build the scale the experiences that key player's connected. So on balance, we think this is great for the industry. It will almost certainly extend the console cycle almost an infinite level if we get to a point where there's just constant hardware upgrades and constant software upgrades but we are able, through the scaling of our games to keep the community always together. More broadly even in Star Wars franchise again, this is a long-term play for us. We're very excited. We were overjoyed with the performance was Star Wars Battlefront. We're overjoyed with the 6.6 million players [ph] that played the game through Q1. We're continuing to support that. As each movie comes out over the time of our relationship, we expect that the Star Wars community will continue to grow, and we will be doing our best to align, in some cases, the content and experiences and in some cases, just a passion for Star Wars but certainly, aligning what we're doing around the Star Wars universe with what's more broadly happening with Star Wars pop culture.

In terms of the Olympics, Andrew can probably jump in here. But I think, often times, the [indiscernible] are sports going on that we have games associated with. There's a lot of positive. As you see with the FIFA Ultimate Team numbers relative to the euro and the CopaAmerica. We didn't have programs directly linked to those that people engage in those because their favorite players are playing on new teams or in new tournaments, so that drives women. So I think in general, athletics bring people back to athletics. If they're watching on TV, they're oftentimes going to try to intimidate or imitate that somewhere else and that may benefit some of our games."

We've got a great experience coming later in the year that I played and it's super fun and super exciting. I think that part of the reason people play games is kind of immerse themselves in a fantasy and escape and fulfill these fantasies with their friends. Typically, when we design games, we design them on the big screen TV and we have to overcome, as designers, the special disconnect between us and the television. Of course, virtual reality, we don't have to overcome that special disconnect. So the more that we can introduce people to load vary to entry virtual reality, I think the faster it's going to take off in the industry.

We try to keep people in our networks to steer them in other games in our network, which is powerful that this and make us any money it just keeps people in the network. And two, the next piece is we might tend to show people advertising if they're not monetizing in other ways. What I will tell you is because most of mobile game uses anonymous, it's hard to collect data on your mobile users. That means the value of that advertising or the CPMs are fairly low, and that's the reason that's less than $100 million for us even though we have a large mobile network. We'll continue to experiment with that and we'll continue to look at it but we don't see that as a giant revenue growth opportunity for us at this point in time.

Much of the international -- much of FIFA's marketplaces international particularly Europe.

Our first quarter was an excellent start for fiscal year 2017, demonstrating how our digital transformation continues to strengthen and drive growth for Electronic Arts. Revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance, as players engaged deeply with their favorite games and connected with each other across our global network of live services. 
On HD platforms, we have thriving communities in our major franchises, and these will continue to grow as we introduced great new experiences this year. More than 11.5 million people played our Battlefield titles during Q1, and more than 6.6 million played Star Wars Battlefront, 2 examples that illustrate how great games continued to engage players over time.
Looking ahead, there were tremendous excitement for both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, a combination that we believe will bring vitality and innovation to the huge first-person shooter audience. The community has been electrified by Battlefield 1's modern take on Mobile 1, delivering strategy, team play and epic scale in a completely new setting. Titanfall 2 is bringing the game's signature pilot and tighten combat to a new single-player campaign, and its fast and fluid multiplayer led it to win the Best Online Multiplayer Award from the E3 Game Critics. These 2 titles are driving the variety, progression and first new experiences that players want, and we believe there will be an unstoppable pairing during the holiday quarter.
Our EA SPORTS titles on console are also seeing massive engagement, and players will be thrilled with the new ways to play in this year's games. 
Unique players in Madden NFL grew 20% in Q1 over last year's game, and current and new fans alike will love Madden NFL 17's redesigned franchise mode and new competitive tournament, the Madden NFL 17 Championship Series. 
In our FIFA franchise, millions of soccer fans continue to engage daily with FIFA Ultimate Team, and this year, we'll deliver our first-ever story mode in FIFA 17.  Powered by our Frostbite engine, story mode adds entirely new dimension to the FIFA experience that has fans incredibly excited. And perennial fan-favorite NHL 17 will have hockey fans show their national pride through the all-new World Cup of Hockey mode.
In our mobile business, we are seeing growth across multiple genres. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes  players spent nearly 2.5 hours per day on average in the game, reflecting how much players continue to enjoy the RPG-style combat and in-game community events. 
In the sports genre, our EA SPORTS mobile titles continue to gain momentum and connect with even more passionate fans. Madden NFL Mobile had 25% more monthly active players in Q1 year-over-year and 37 more game sessions in the same period. We have continued to invest in great experiences for sports fans across the globe. Our new Madden NFL Mobile season is coming soon. 
NBA LIVE Mobile just launched on iOS and Android, and hit #1 on the U.S. App Store free download chart, and we have a new FIFA mobile game coming later this year.  
With our focus on groundbreaking new games, dynamic digital experiences and deeper player relationships, EA is innovating to lead our industry.  A new EA play event in June was built on these same principles, inviting our players in and join beyond the typical format to drive a global conversation. Nearly 9,000 fans joined us in Los Angeles and London and millions more connected online to dive deeper into our upcoming games. We live-streamed more than 20 hours of gameplay and competitive gaming events. And more importantly, hundreds of community influencers captured more than 1,400 hours of content from our games to share with the community.
Feedback from players who got hands on our EA PLAY was very positive. And more than ever, we are fulfilling the needs of our players and content creators that connects by sharing great experiences in the games they love to play. We're off to a strong start for Q1, and the year ahead is going to be an exciting one for our players, for Electronic Arts and for our industry.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

However, since our board and management team will continue to use these measures internally to manage the business, we will continue to provide the financial data to allow you to compare our results to our historically reported non-GAAP financials. For more information on this, please see the documents we posted on our Investor Relations website, following our July 19 call.
Now on to the quarter. Q1 beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from ultimate team and our mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.271 billion. This benefited from a change in deferred net revenue of $589 million, resulting in a non-GAAP net revenue of $682 million, well above our guidance of $640 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP net revenue is always the sum of GAAP net revenue and the change in different net revenue. The change this quarter is negative. Thus, non-GAAP revenue is smaller than GAAP net revenue this quarter. See our earnings documents in July 19 information -- or for more information.
GAAP revenue is up year-on-year, driven by deferrals of Star Wars Battlefront revenue from Q3 fiscal 2016. The underlying business is down slightly year-on-year, but remember, the year-ago quarter benefited from strong catalog sales of Battlefield Hardline, which launched 2 weeks before the beginning of the quarter. Last year's quarter also included an extra week and one-off revenue recognition of the $31 million for FIFA Online 3 in China. 
A note here on quarterly comparisons in a GAAP-only reporting environment. Because GAAP revenue is built from a portion of the sales from the quarter, plus some of the sales from each of the previous 3 quarters, a simple year-on-year comparison doesn't reveal much about the dynamics of the underlying business. Because of this, we will restrict ourselves to qualitative comparisons. We will continue to report all the financial data we use internally to adjust our GAAP financials, so you may derive comparable measures for yourself. We're also consider adding other metrics that might be used to quantify business trends. 
We will continue to focus on our most important financial metric, operating cash flow. Our trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, a record for the period. Capital expenditures for the 12 months were $109 million, delivering a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $937 million.
Our GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter was $689 million, benefiting from a change in deferred revenues of $121 million, resulting in $568 million on a non-GAAP basis. Digital continues to grow as a percentage of the business, and this quarter marked a new high. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights performance of each of these businesses this quarter.
Extra content and free-to-play contributed $300 million to GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $42 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $258 million. As mentioned earlier, the year-ago quarter had a one-off benefit of $31 million from FIFA Online 3 in China. Underlying growth was strong, as FIFA Ultimate Team benefited from the heightened interest in soccer, driven by the Euros and Copa America. FIFA Online 3 continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.
Mobile is up strongly year-on-year, driven by the strength of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Mobile generated $165 million in GAAP net revenue in the quarter, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $24 million. Thus non-GAAP net revenue was $141 million. Note that under GAAP rules, online-enabled content for mobile games, including in-game currencies, is also recognized ratably over a service period. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $137 million of GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred revenue of $53 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $84 million.
Digital downloads were high in the quarter, as expected for a period dominated by catalog sales. Sales growth year-on-year was flat due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline in Q1 last year. We continue to anticipate that the proportion of games bought digitally will increase by about 5 percentage points this year.
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $87 million to GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP was $85 million. The underlying business was up, supported by the growth in subscriptions from EA Access and Origin Access.
Moving on to gross profit. Our GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a gross margin of 85.9%. Remember that GAAP revenue, particularly in Q1, is driven by revenue deferred from prior quarters, whereas cost of goods sold is driven by the volume of sales actually in Q1. You can, therefore, expect to see some volatility in the quarterly non-GAAP gross margin, as we move through the year. 
GAAP cost of goods sold was $179 million, which included $13 million of amortization of intangibles and $1 million of stock-based compensation. Therefore, non-GAAP COGS was $165 million and non-GAAP gross profit was $517 million, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 75.8%. This was down 1 percentage points year-on-year because of the extra FIFA Online 3 revenue recognized in Q1 fiscal '16.
GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $532 million, including $47 million of stock-based compensation and $2 million of amortization of intangibles. Thus, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $483 million. Currency movements actually added to expenses this quarter, as rates were higher for most of the quarter than when we gave guidance, although the British pound in particular fell at the end of the period. Despite the unexpected currency headwinds, underlying expenses were down year-on-year.
The resulting GAAP diluted EPS was $1.40 per share. Adjustments required to derive the non-GAAP EPS include: the $589 million change in deferred net revenue; $15 million of amortization of intangibles; $48 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and costs of goods sold; debt-related expenses of $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% and a reduction of 2 million shares for the convertible bond hedge, which is not included in the GAAP share count. See the example we posted for Q4 fiscal 2016, following our July 19 call, for details on how to apply these to derive the non-GAAP EPS.  Non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.07 and $0.12 better than our guidance. Outperformance in our digital business drove both top line and profitability higher than we have anticipated this quarter.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.427 billion. 48% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. During Q1, we settled 27 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. We completed repayment of the remaining notes in July. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway is that our diluted share count, whether expressed as GAAP or non-GAAP, already includes the potential dilution at the current share price.  We also repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $129 million, leaving $410 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. This is typical for a first quarter. The year-ago quarter was atypical in that it had substantial collections from Battlefield Hardline sales. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $1.05 billion.
I wanted to take a moment away from our quarterly results to discuss our FX hedging program in a broader context. We run a global basis, with roughly half our revenue coming from outside the U.S. Volatility in exchange rates is still very high by historical standards, and macro economic events like the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union are injecting even more uncertainty into the system. A comprehensive hedging program is important in ordinary times, but the extraordinary events of the last year or so made it critical. Our hedging program has 2 components: one, to reduce volatility in the P&L; and a second that does the same for the balance sheet.
The first is designed to hedge anticipated revenue and expenses across 7 of EA's largest foreign currency exposures. Combined, these 7 currencies represent approximately 70% of our non-U.S. dollar operating income. We hedge with forward contracts up to 18 months out.
The second covers FX exposure to net monetary assets and liabilities, including third-party accounts receivable and payables as well as intercompany balances. This program aims for 100% coverage of 17 currencies, which account for about 90% of EA's non-U.S. dollar net monetary exposure. We had the swaps and forward contracts that generally have a maturity of 3 months or less. Together, these programs are designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on our business.
Turning to guidance. We're excited about the expanded franchise mode in Madden NFL 17 and by the FIFA story mode powered by Frostbite. We expect our second quarter GAAP net revenue to be $915 million. This includes a headwind from the anticipated change in deferred net revenue of $160 million. Note that this is an increase in deferred net revenue. Thus, we expect the non-GAAP measures we would have reported under our previous approach to be higher than the GAAP net revenue in Q2. In other words, you need to add GAAP revenue of $915 million to deferred net revenue of $160 million to arrive at a comparable non-GAAP numbers in your model.
With regards to year-on-year comparison, remember, FIFA 17 will launch 4 days before the end of the quarter as opposed to the 11 days FIFA 16 had in the quarter last year. This means very little of the digital revenue associated with FIFA 17 for full game downloads and FIFA Ultimate Team can be recognized in the quarter. We estimate that absent changes in deferred revenue, about $75 million of high-margin mostly digital sales are pushed into Q3. We anticipate a currency headwind to a year-on-year comparisons -- to add to year-on-year comparisons, and this is factored into our outlook for revenue and change in deferred revenue. Our expectations of currency impact on the whole year have not changed.
Cost of goods sold during the quarter is expected to be $405 million, including $13 million of amortization of intangibles. Rather than guide GAAP gross margins, which can be highly volatile from quarter-to-quarter due to revenue deferrals, we believe that guiding COGS will give you a better insight into our business. With GAAP net revenue, the change in deferred net revenue and COGS, you can calculate both GAAP gross margins and a gross margin comparable to the non-GAAP measures we have given in the past. We expect our Q2 GAAP operating expenses to be $566 million, including about $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in amortization of intangibles. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. 
This result in a GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.17.  As mentioned earlier, this was driven by costs associated with the major sports launches being recognized within the quarter, but much of the revenue being deferred out of the quarter. Adjustments requited to derive the non-GAAP EPS include: the $160 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and COGS, $14 million in amortization of intangibles, and a reduction of 2 million shares from the convertible bond hedge. Debt-related expenses are expected to be below $1 million this quarter.  With regards to the underlying business, we would expect it to be down slightly year-on-year, driven by the roughly $75 million of FIFA sales that has moved to Q3.
We are not changing our annual outlook for revenue and net income at this time. EA PLAY and the response of E3 was very positive, but it's too early to attempt to extrapolate from that to full year results, particularly in a fiscal year that is expected to be so back-end loaded. We are updating our GAAP diluted share count for the year to 316 million, primarily based on the repurchase activity in the first quarter. This increases the GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to $2.56 for the year. It remains our practice to not factor in potential repurchases into our forecasted share count for the full year.
Regarding cash flow for the full year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.2 billion. The ongoing strength of our live services and the reception to our upcoming launches bodes well for the rest of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

We tend not to try to raise guidance too early in the year. We would like to see a little more demand metrics on all of our products, particularly Battlefield and Titanfall, before we make that decision. Gamescom is a very important beat that's coming up in a couple of weeks in Europe. And then, obviously, the potential for beta is around. Those products will help us derive better demand metrics. Last year, if you remember, we did raise guidance coming out of the first quarter because our initial forecast on Battlefront, the Star Wars title, is relatively low, and we moved that up. We've got a fairly normal forecast for Battlefield and Titanfall, so we're not moving those yet, but we're still super-optimistic about the titles and very excited to more come in the future. But we felt it was just too early in the year to try to move guidance on any other titles going forward. On the share count piece, we have been, over time, bringing down stock-based compensation. It's important part of the overall compensation. We feel it's important as part of our employees and executives to bear some of the risks of maybe the stockholders and making -- having your conversation as part of that is critical.

We balance that with the requirements of attracting the greatest people that we can in the industry, and we feel like that mix is a pretty good mix today.

We continue to believe that we'll see upside in the number of consoles sold this year, and the software attach rate stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen up through the cycle so far. And so all that, I think, bodes well for the overall cycle and should continue to help us drive upside. Now on the revenue growth, the numbers I laid out at the Analyst Day were, basically, if you take our year-end fiscal 2016 results and you look out over the 2020 to '22 timeframe, we believe that we could add another $1.5 billion of revenue from areas such as genre growth moving into the action genre, continuing to grow our mobile business, continuing to grow our business in Asia and other parts of the emerging markets around the world, and we believe that could then continue to drive free cash flow growth and earnings growth. And $1.5 billion of additional revenue should be able to drive $1 billion in operating income and just under $1 billion in free cash flow growth during that time. Obviously, those are all non-GAAP numbers. So -- and we feel confident about the progress that we're making there."

Ultimate Team, as you're all well aware of, it's a deeply engaging way to enjoy the sports you love as well as the video game you love. That's a mechanic can work well inside of a mobile game, not just in sports but also in games that we're proving with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. It's event-driven. Activities, new things, new characters, new ways to play that are constantly brought into the game that keeps people coming back and keeps the level of that engagement at the height that you're seeing. We think that's very sustainable because you are able to continue to add activities. In the sports world, it works well because you're dealing with the real-world sport all the time. But in the fantasy world, it's even better because you don't have the limits that you have in the real world. And so our goal is to continue to add new exciting context, ways to play, characters' enjoyment and the games that will keep them alive for many years to come and I think, obviously, keeps them monetizing over time."

So on the player network, I mean, you're going hear a lot more about this from us. As we look to the future, as we think about where games are going, we see some fundamental problems arising if you are a gamer. So in a world where gamers are playing more games across more devices through more business models in more geographies than ever before, the concept as a player of always being able to stay connected to your friends and always being able to stay connected to the games you love, irrespective of what device you play on, is going to be an important problem to solve. We believe that the investment that we've been making in our core digital platform with an ID that travels with you across devices, with a single data infrastructure that allows us to always understand the full 360-degree view of you as a player, and all of the services that are built on top of that, that allow you to connect with your friends across devices, is going to be an imperative part of our future. What you're starting to see now is this line up inside of -- across our console games, across our mobile games. We're making tremendous headway. That means, no matter where you play, you can remain connected to your friends. If you move from iOS to Android and you are using our ID system, you do not loose your game progress. As you start to think about the communities that we build and connected with those communities, particularly in things like Ultimate Team, we are seeing tremendous engagement where we are able to deliver you by virtue of this player network experiences that are personal, contextual and meaningful to you and your friends. We're seeing that the engagement improve dramatically, and we're seeing that players are opting into more and more of our games because we are finding a way to present them with opportunities that are meaningful and personal for them. You're going to see more and more of this in the future. We expect that it will continue to become a powerful tool in how we engage with players, but as importantly how players engage with each other. And in the broader network world that we now live in, the power of our network will be directly proportion to the number of players inside the network and the strength of connections between the players inside that network. And a lot of what we are doing as it relates to our core digital platform development, our single engine development and our broader portfolio of game development is all in service of manifesting the strength in that network. As it relates to Pokemon Go, great question. First, as a comment, I think that with that team has done is very, very strong. It's a great blend of an IP that we have known and loved for the best part of 20 years and a new technology that introduces that to a new audience through mobile devices. What you've heard from us is that we have been working on both VR and AR for some time. We have made some announcements around VR in mobile and on console with PlayStation VR, and we're going to continue to invest there. As you can imagine, we are energized by the success of Pokemon Go. We have tremendously strong brands that are unbelievably social in nature, where we believe that participation at a community level through AR will just tighten the experience. And we have been working on some things for some time, and we'll continue to working on those, and we'll be ready to launch them at a time where we think we can better engage communities through AR."

How you're preparing for that? What that might mean in terms of growing the market, making customers aware of your titles and sort of managing through that transition? And then on Star Wars, we saw the announcement at Star Wars Celebration. It looks as if the expansion pack this year is going to be more tightly intertwined with the actual movie content that comes out in December. What might that mean for sort of the breadth of the platform going forward as well as maybe even marketing efficiency since the content could be so tied closely with the movie?"

The reality for us is, again, in a networked world, liquidity of play is really, really important. And what we've seen over the last a decade or more with respect to PC gamers is that communities continue to grow and it's growing in a world where the hardware refresh cycle has been disconnected from the software refresh cycle. And what that meant is that irrespective of what kind of device you have within kind of a 7- to 10-year time frame, you're able to play with a much, much bigger global community. What we see now with the things that we've talked about with a mid-cycle refresh is that's only going to enhance the size and engagement levels inside the communities. For us as a publisher, we're in a very strong place. We've been building a cross-platform and a cross-console and for scalable architectures like PC for some time. So the notion that we would build once and experience that can scale up and down across an entire spectrum of consoles, whether the first phase, the second phase or the third phase over time, is not something that's foreign to us and something that we're very energized about because, again, I think we have strength in a networked world and we have strength where there is a requirement to build these scale of experiences that key players connected. So on balance, we think this is great for the industry. It will almost certainly extend the console cycle almost an infinite level if we get to a point where there's just constant hardware upgrades and constant software upgrades, but we are able through the scaling of our games to keep the community always together. More broadly even at the Star Wars franchise, again, this is a long-term play for us. We're very excited. We were overjoyed with the performance was Star Wars Battlefront. We're overjoyed with the 6.6 million players that played the game through Q1. We're continuing to support that. As each movie comes out over the time of our relationship, we expect that the Star Wars community will continue to grow. And we will be doing our best to align, in some cases, the content and experiences, and in some cases, just the passion for Star Wars, but certainly aligning what we're doing around the Star Wars universe with what's more broadly happening with Star Wars pop culture. And we think that's a win as we continue to live up to the fans long term."

We've told people that typically, a Battlefield title does about 15 million in the year. Our guidance is slightly under that, and we hope that, that excitement builds and it will clearly go through that number, but for right now, slightly under that number.

We think it'll do more than that, but it's probably closer to 10 million as to 15 million is built into our guidance. So closer to 9 million to 10 million on Titanfall and just under 15 million on Battlefield 1. In terms of the Olympics, Andrew can probably jump in here. But I think, often times, if there are sports going on that we have games associated with, there is a lot of positive. As you see with the FIFA Ultimate Team numbers relative to the Euro and the Copa America, we didn't have programs directly linked to those, but people engage in those because their favorite players are playing on new teams or in new tournaments, and that drives them in. So I think, in general, athletics bring people back to athletics. If they're watching on TV, they're oftentimes going to try to intimidate or imitate that somewhere else, and that may benefit some of our games."

And that's the reason it's less than $100 million for us even though we have a large mobile network. We'll continue to experiment with that, and we'll continue to look at it, but we don't see that as a giant revenue growth opportunity for us at this point in time. On the international piece, I think some of it's simply driven by the strength of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team. Much of the international -- much of FIFA's marketplaces internationally, particularly Europe, and as that business continues to get stronger, you're going to see that skewing particularly in a quarter where Ultimate Team is so important where there's not as many new releases that'll skew the revenue to the international."

Our first quarter was an excellent start for fiscal year 2017, demonstrating how our digital transformation continues to strengthen and drive growth for Electronic Arts. Revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance, as players engaged deeply with their favorite games and connected with each other across our global network of live services. 
On HD platforms, we have thriving communities in our major franchises, and these will continue to grow as we introduced great new experiences this year. More than 11.5 million people played our Battlefield titles during Q1, and more than 6.6 million played Star Wars Battlefront, 2 examples that illustrate how great games continue to engage players over time.
Looking ahead, there were tremendous excitement for both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, a combination that we believe will bring vitality and innovation to the huge first-person shooter audience. The community has been electrified by Battlefield 1's modern take on World War I, delivering strategy, team play and epic scale in a completely new setting. Titanfall 2 is bringing the game's signature pilot and titan combat to a new single-player campaign, and its fast and fluid multiplayer led it to win the Best Online Multiplayer Award from the E3 Game Critics. These 2 titles are driving the variety, progression and fresh new experiences that players want, and we believe they will be an unstoppable pairing during the holiday quarter.
Our EA SPORTS titles on console are also seeing massive engagement, and players will be thrilled with the new ways to play in this year's games. 
Unique players in Madden NFL grew 20% in Q1 over last year's game, and current and new fans alike will love Madden NFL 17's redesigned franchise mode and new competitive tournament, the Madden NFL 17 Championship Series. 
In our FIFA franchise, millions of soccer fans continue to engage daily with FIFA Ultimate Team, and this year, we'll deliver our first-ever story mode in FIFA 17.  Powered by our Frostbite engine, story mode adds entirely new dimension to the FIFA experience that has fans incredibly excited. And perennial fan-favorite NHL 17 will have hockey fans show their national pride through the all-new World Cup of Hockey mode.
In our mobile business, we are seeing growth across multiple genres. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes  players spent nearly 2.5 hours per day on average in the game, reflecting how much players continue to enjoy the RPG-style combat and in-game community events. 
In the sports genre, our EA SPORTS mobile titles continue to gain momentum and connect with even more passionate fans. Madden NFL Mobile had 25% more monthly active players in Q1 year-over-year and 37 more game sessions in the same period. We have continued to invest in great experiences for sports fans across the globe. A new Madden NFL Mobile season is coming soon. 
NBA LIVE Mobile just launched on iOS and Android, and hit #1 on the U.S. App Store free download chart, and we have a new FIFA mobile game coming later this year.  
With our focus on groundbreaking new games, dynamic digital experiences and deeper player relationships, EA is innovating to lead our industry. Our new EA play event in June was built on these same principles, inviting our players in and join beyond the typical format to drive a global conversation. Nearly 9,000 fans joined us in Los Angeles and London and millions more connected online to dive deeper into our upcoming games. We live-streamed more than 20 hours of gameplay and competitive gaming events. And more importantly, hundreds of community influencers captured more than 1,400 hours of content from our games to share with the community.
Feedback from players who got hands on our EA PLAY was very positive. And more than ever, we are fulfilling the needs of our players and content creators that connect by sharing great experiences in the games they love to play. We're off to a strong start for Q1, and the year ahead is going to be an exciting one for our players, for Electronic Arts and for our industry.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,375263266,1022501,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. As we discussed on our July 19 call, the SEC has issued new interpretations that no longer permit the use of non-GAAP measures that adjust for revenue deferrals into and out of the quarter.

As we discussed on our July 19 call, the SEC has issued new interpretations that no longer permit the use of non-GAAP measures that adjust for revenue deferrals into and out of the quarter. As well as revenue, we've historical adjusted many non-GAAP financial measures for the effect of revenue deferrals, including gross margin and EPS. This is the last call in which we'll report these non-GAAP measures. 
However, since our board and management team will continue to use these measures internally to manage the business, we will continue to provide the financial data to allow you to compare our results to our historically reported non-GAAP financials. For more information on this, please see the documents we posted on our Investor Relations website, following our July 19 call.
Now on to the quarter. Q1 beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Ultimate Team and our mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.271 billion. This benefited from a change in deferred net revenue of $589 million, resulting in a non-GAAP net revenue of $682 million, well above our guidance of $640 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP net revenue is always the sum of GAAP net revenue and the change in deferred net revenue. The change this quarter is negative. Thus, non-GAAP revenue is smaller than GAAP net revenue this quarter. See our earnings documents in July 19 information -- or for more information.
GAAP revenue is up year-on-year, driven by deferrals of Star Wars Battlefront revenue from Q3 fiscal 2016. The underlying business is down slightly year-on-year, but remember, the year-ago quarter benefited from strong catalog sales of Battlefield Hardline, which launched 2 weeks before the beginning of the quarter. Last year's quarter also included an extra week and one-off revenue recognition of the $31 million for FIFA Online 3 in China. 
A note here on quarterly comparisons in a GAAP-only reporting environment. Because GAAP revenue is built from a portion of the sales from the quarter, plus some of the sales from each of the previous 3 quarters, a simple year-on-year comparison doesn't reveal much about the dynamics of the underlying business. Because of this, we will restrict ourselves to qualitative comparisons. We will continue to report all the financial data we use internally to adjust our GAAP financials, so you may derive comparable measures for yourself. We're also consider adding other metrics that might be used to quantify business trends. 
We will continue to focus on our most important financial metric, operating cash flow. Our trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, a record for the period. Capital expenditures for the 12 months were $109 million, delivering a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $937 million.
Our GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter was $689 million, benefiting from a change in deferred revenues of $121 million, resulting in $568 million on a non-GAAP basis. Digital continues to grow as a percentage of the business, and this quarter marked a new high. 
Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter.
Extra content and free-to-play contributed $300 million to GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $42 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $258 million. As mentioned earlier, the year-ago quarter had a one-off benefit of $31 million from FIFA Online 3 in China. Underlying growth was strong, as FIFA Ultimate Team benefited from the heightened interest in soccer, driven by the Euros and Copa America. FIFA Online 3 continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.
Mobile was up strongly year-on-year, driven by the strength of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Mobile generated $165 million in GAAP net revenue in the quarter, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $24 million. Thus non-GAAP net revenue was $141 million. Note that under GAAP rules, online-enabled content for mobile games, including in-game currencies, is also recognized ratably over a service period. 
Full game PC and console downloads generated $137 million of GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred revenue of $53 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $84 million.
Digital downloads were high in the quarter, as expected for a period dominated by catalog sales. Sales growth year-on-year was flat due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline in Q1 last year. We continue to anticipate that the proportion of games bought digitally will increase by about 5 percentage points this year.
Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $87 million to GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP was $85 million. The underlying business was up, supported by the growth in subscriptions for EA Access and Origin Access.
Moving on to gross profit. Our GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a gross margin of 85.9%. Remember that GAAP revenue, particularly in Q1, is driven by revenue deferred from prior quarters, whereas cost of goods sold is driven by the volume of sales actually in Q1. You can, therefore, expect to see some volatility in the quarterly GAAP gross margin, as we move through the year. 
GAAP cost of goods sold was $179 million, which included $13 million of amortization of intangibles and $1 million of stock-based compensation. Therefore, non-GAAP COGS was $165 million and non-GAAP gross profit was $517 million, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 75.8%. This was down 1 percentage points year-on-year because of the extra FIFA Online 3 revenue recognized in Q1 fiscal '16.
GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $532 million, including $47 million of stock-based compensation and $2 million of amortization of intangibles. Thus, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $483 million. Currency movements actually added to expenses this quarter, as rates were higher for most of the quarter than when we gave guidance, although the British pound in particular fell at the end of the period. Despite the unexpected currency headwinds, underlying expenses were down year-on-year.
The resulting GAAP diluted EPS was $1.40 per share. Adjustments required to derive the non-GAAP EPS include: the $589 million change in deferred net revenue; $15 million of amortization of intangibles; $48 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and costs of goods sold; debt-related expenses of $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% and a reduction of 2 million shares for the convertible bond hedge, which is not included in the GAAP share count. See the example we posted for Q4 fiscal 2016, following our July 19 call, for details on how to apply these to derive the non-GAAP EPS.  Non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.07 and $0.12 better than our guidance. Outperformance in our digital business drove both top line and profitability higher than we have anticipated this quarter.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.427 billion. 48% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. During Q1, we settled 27 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. We completed repayment of the remaining notes in July. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway is that our diluted share count, whether expressed as GAAP or non-GAAP, already includes the potential dilution at the current share price.  We also repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $129 million, leaving $410 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. This is typical for a first quarter. The year-ago quarter was atypical in that it had substantial collections from Battlefield Hardline sales. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $1.05 billion.
I wanted to take a moment away from our quarterly results to discuss our FX hedging program in a broader context. We run a global basis, with roughly half our revenue coming from outside the U.S. Volatility in exchange rates is still very high by historical standards, and macroeconomic events like the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union are injecting even more uncertainty into the system. A comprehensive hedging program is important in ordinary times, but the extraordinary events of the last year or so made it critical. Our hedging program has 2 components: one, to reduce volatility in the P&L; and a second that does the same for the balance sheet.
The first is designed to hedge anticipated revenue and expenses across 7 of EA's largest foreign currency exposures. Combined, these 7 currencies represent approximately 70% of our non-U.S. dollar operating income. We hedge with forward contracts up to 18 months out.
The second covers FX exposure to net monetary assets and liabilities, including third-party accounts receivable and payables as well as intercompany balances. This program aims for 100% coverage of 17 currencies, which account for about 90% of EA's non-U.S. dollar net monetary exposure. We had the swaps and forward contracts that generally have a maturity of 3 months or less. Together, these programs are designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on our business.
Turning to guidance. We're excited about the expanded franchise mode in Madden NFL 17 and by the FIFA story mode powered by Frostbite. We expect our second quarter GAAP net revenue to be $915 million. This includes a headwind from the anticipated change in deferred net revenue of $160 million. Note that this is an increase in deferred net revenue. Thus, we expect the non-GAAP measures we would have reported under our previous approach to be higher than the GAAP net revenue in Q2. In other words, you need to add GAAP revenue of $915 million to deferred net revenue of $160 million to arrive at the comparable non-GAAP numbers in your model.
With regards to year-on-year comparison, remember, FIFA 17 will launch 4 days before the end of the quarter as opposed to the 11 days FIFA 16 had in the quarter last year. This means very little of the digital revenue associated with FIFA 17 for full game downloads and FIFA Ultimate Team can be recognized in the quarter. We estimate that absent changes in deferred revenue, about $75 million of high-margin mostly digital sales are pushed into Q3. We anticipate a currency headwind to a year-on-year comparisons -- to add to year-on-year comparisons, and this is factored into our outlook for revenue and change in deferred revenue. Our expectations of currency impact on the whole year have not changed.
Cost of goods sold during the quarter is expected to be $405 million, including $13 million of amortization of intangibles. Rather than guide GAAP gross margins, which can be highly volatile from quarter-to-quarter due to revenue deferrals, we believe that guiding COGS will give you a better insight into our business. With GAAP net revenue, the change in deferred net revenue and COGS, you can calculate both GAAP gross margins and a gross margin comparable to the non-GAAP measures we have given in the past. We expect our Q2 GAAP operating expenses to be $566 million, including about $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in amortization of intangibles. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. 
This results in a GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.17.  As mentioned earlier, this is driven by costs associated with the major sports launches being recognized within the quarter, but much of the revenue being deferred out of the quarter. Adjustments requited to derive the non-GAAP EPS include: the $160 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and COGS, $14 million in amortization of intangibles, and a reduction of 2 million shares from the convertible bond hedge. Debt-related expenses are expected to be below $1 million this quarter.  With regards to the underlying business, we would expect it to be down slightly year-on-year, driven by the roughly $75 million of FIFA sales that has moved to Q3.
We are not changing our annual outlook for revenue and net income at this time. EA PLAY and the response of E3 was very positive, but it's too early to attempt to extrapolate from that to full year results, particularly in a fiscal year that is expected to be so back-end loaded. We are updating our GAAP diluted share count for the year to 316 million, primarily based on the repurchase activity in the first quarter. This increases the GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to $2.56 for the year. It remains our practice to not factor in potential repurchases into our forecasted share count for the full year.
Regarding cash flow for the full year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.2 billion. The ongoing strength of our live services and the reception to our upcoming launches bodes well for the rest of the year.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

First, we were very pleased at the reaction of players at our EA PLAY, I think you got a chance to play it yourself, but it's been be very, very popular and the feedback has been extremely strong. We tend not to try to raise guidance too early in the year. We would like to see a little more demand metrics on all of our products, particularly Battlefield and Titanfall, before we make that decision. Gamescom is a very important beat that's coming up in a couple of weeks in Europe. And then, obviously, the potential for betas around those products will help us derive better demand metrics. Last year, if you remember, we did raise guidance coming out of the first quarter because our initial forecast on Battle -- Battlefront the Star Wars title, was relatively low and we moved that up. We've got a fairly normal forecast for Battlefield and Titanfall, so we're not moving those yet, but we're still super-optimistic about the titles and very excited so more to come in the future. But we felt it was just too early in the year to try to move guidance on any of the titles going forward. On the share count piece, we have been, over time, bringing down stock-based compensation. It's important part of the overall compensation. We feel it's important as part of our employees and executives to bear some of the risks of maybe [ph] the stockholders and making -- having your conversation as part of that is critical. But we also recognize that we need to bring all compensation down over time to continue to be profitable as a company. We balance that with the requirements of attracting the greatest people that we can in the industry, and we feel like that mix is a pretty good mix today. But we will, obviously, be trying to drive down the share count between a combination of managing aggressive buybacks as well as prudent management of our overall compensation pool."

On our attach rates, we're continuing to be excited about the growth of the overall console business, and I think the plans that were announced at E3 around both Xbox and PlayStation were viewed in the industry as very positive. I think, moving beyond the notion of -- or jumping into the compatibility issue head on and trying to stop the notion of having consoles that are not compatible will help the software side of the equation dramatically over time, and I think that's a big plus. We continue to believe that we'll see upside in the number of consoles sold this year, and the software attach rate stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen up through the cycle so far. And so all that, I think, bodes well for the overall cycle and should continue to help us drive upside. Now on the revenue growth, the numbers I laid out at the Analyst Day were, basically, if you take our year-end fiscal 2016 results and you look out over the 2020 to '22 timeframe, we believe that we could add another $1.5 billion of revenue from areas such as genre growth moving into the action genre, continuing to grow our mobile business, continuing to grow our business in Asia and other parts of the emerging markets around the world, and we believe that could then continue to drive free cash flow growth and earnings growth. And $1.5 billion of additional revenue should be able to drive $1 billion in operating income and just under $1 billion in free cash flow growth during that time. Obviously, those are all non-GAAP numbers. So -- and we feel confident about the progress that we're making there."

Our broader catalog of SimCity and the Sims, and Need for Speed, and Real Racing, also continue to perform very well. As I said earlier, we've just launched NBA LIVE mobile. We launched that well in advance of the season to ensure good and strong ramp, both at the game design, the architecture and infrastructure. And with a lot of basketball happenings still with the summer season and a certain competitive sports event going on in Rio over the next couple of weeks, we believe it's a great opportunity to start to ramp our NBA business on mobile, and it's performing extremely well, and follows a similar design and modality of play to what we have learned engages fans to the highest degree around Madden. As we've talked about before, we're also looking to do that with FIFA.

That same mechanic can work well inside of a mobile game, not just in sports but also in games that we're proving with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. It's event-driven. Activities, new things, new characters, new ways to play that are constantly brought into the game that keeps people coming back and keeps the level of that engagement at the height that you're seeing. We think that's very sustainable because you are able to continue to add activities. In the sports world, it works well because you're dealing with the real-world sport all the time. But in the fantasy world, it's even better because you don't have the limits that you have in the real world.

So on the player network, I mean, you're going hear a lot more about this from us. As we look to the future, as we think about where games are going, we see some fundamental problems arising if you are a gamer. So in a world where gamers are playing more games across more devices through more business models in more geographies than ever before, the concept as a player of always being able to stay connected to your friends and always being able to stay connected to the games you love, irrespective of what device you play on, is going to be an important problem to solve. We believe that the investment that we've been making in our core digital platform with an ID that travels with you across devices, with a single data infrastructure that allows us to always understand the full 360-degree view of you as a player, and all of the services that are built on top of that, that allow you to connect with your friends across devices, is going to be an imperative part of our future. What you're starting to see now is this line up inside of -- across our console games, across our mobile games. We're making tremendous headway. That means, no matter where you play, you can remain connected to your friends. If you move from iOS to Android and you are using our ID system, you do not lose your game progress. As you start to think about the communities that we build and connect with those communities, particularly in things like Ultimate Team, we are seeing tremendous engagement where we are able to deliver you by virtue of this player network experiences that are personal, contextual and meaningful to you and your friends. We're seeing that the engagement improve dramatically, and we're seeing that players are opting into more and more of our games because we are finding a way to present them with opportunities that are meaningful and personal for them. You're going to see more and more of this in the future. We expect that it will continue to become a powerful tool in how we engage with players, but as importantly how players engage with each other. And in the broader network world that we now live in, the power of our network will be directly proportionate to the number of players inside the network and the strength of connections between the players inside that network. And a lot of what we are doing as it relates to our core digital platform development, our single engine development and our broader portfolio of game development is all in service of manifesting the strength in that network. As it relates to Pokemon Go, great question. First, as a comment, I think that what that team has done is very, very strong. It's a great blend of an IP that we have known and loved for the best part of 20 years and a new technology that introduces that to a new audience through mobile devices. What you've heard from us is that we have been working on both VR and AR for some time. We have made some announcements around VR in mobile and on console with PlayStation VR, and we're going to continue to invest there. As you can imagine, we are energized by the success of Pokemon Go. We have tremendously strong brands that are unbelievably social in nature, where we believe that participation at a community level through AR will just tighten the experience. And we have been working on some things for some time, and we'll continue to working on those, and we'll be ready to launch them at a time where we think we can better engage communities through AR."

The reality for us is, again, in a networked world, liquidity of play is really, really important. And what we've seen over the last a decade or more with respect to PC gamers is that community continue to grow and it's growing in a world where the hardware refresh cycle has been disconnected from the software refresh cycle. And what that meant is that irrespective of what kind of device you have within kind of a 7- to 10-year time frame, you're able to play with a much, much bigger global community. What we see now with the things that we've talked about with a mid-cycle refresh is that's only going to enhance the size and engagement levels inside the communities. For us as a publisher, we're in a very strong place. We've been building across platform and across console and for scalable architectures like PC for some time. So the notion that we would build once an experience that can scale up and down across an entire spectrum of consoles, whether the first phase, the second phase or the third phase over time, is not something that's foreign to us and something that we're very energized about because, again, I think we have strength in a networked world and we have strength where there is a requirement to build these scale of experiences that key players connected. So on balance, we think this is great for the industry. It will almost certainly extend the console cycle almost an infinite level if we get to a point where there's just constant hardware upgrades and constant software upgrades, but we are able through the scaling of our games to keep the community always together. More broadly thinking about the Star Wars franchise, again, this is a long-term play for us. We're very excited. We were overjoyed with the performance of Star Wars Battlefront. We're overjoyed with the 6.6 million players that played the game through Q1. We're continuing to support that. As each movie comes out over the time of our relationship, we expect that the Star Wars community will continue to grow. And we will be doing our best to align, in some cases, the content and experiences, and in some cases, just the passion for Star Wars, but certainly aligning what we're doing around the Star Wars universe with what's more broadly happening with Star Wars pop culture. And we think that's a win as we continue to deliver for fans long term."

But I think, often times, if there are sports going on that we have games associated with, there is a lot of positive. As you see with the FIFA Ultimate Team numbers relative to the Euro and the Copa America, we didn't have programs directly linked to those, but people engage in those because their favorite players are playing on new teams or in new tournaments, and that drives them in.

And so we are pretty confident that our guidance for the full year of 10% growth of extra content will be on track, and we should easily be able to beat that over time. Similar dynamic in full game downloads. It was flat year-over-year, but almost all of that flat was driven by the fact that in Q1 last year, we had a huge amount of sales on Battlefield Hardline, a very large title. We didn't have a similar large title. Obviously, we have one title in the quarter, Mirror's Edge, but a much smaller title than the comparison of Battlefield Hardline last year. So we're very confident that the digital growth is continuing and just talking to people to always make sure they look at the drivers of the underlying -- to understand the underlying component."

So on PlayStation VR, again, we're very excited about this -- I think, to your point, given its price point and modality of players, it's one of the more accessible forms of virtual reality play right now. We've got a great experience coming later in the year that I played, and it's super fun and super exciting. I think that part of the reason people play games is to kind of immerse themselves in a fantasy and escape and fulfill these fantasies with their friends. Typically, when we design games, we design them on a big-screen TV, and we have to overcome, as designers, the spatial disconnect between us and the television. Of course, virtual reality, we don't have to overcome that special disconnect. So the more that we can introduce people to low barrier to entry of virtual reality, I think the faster it's going to take off as an industry. And so us as a company, we are looking at how we can invest across all elements of the spectrum from kind of a mobile element right up to the high-end elements. And PlayStation VR, I think, is going to be a great step in the evolution in our industry and the evolution of our how people play games. We're going to continue to invest there."

And two, the next piece is, we might tend to show people advertising, if they're not monetizing in other ways. What I will tell you is because most of mobile game use is anonymous, it's hard to collect data on your mobile users. That means the value of that advertising or the CPMs are fairly low. And thus the reason it's slipped $100 million for us even though we have a large mobile network. We'll continue to experiment with that, and we'll continue to look at it, but we don't see that as a giant revenue growth opportunity for us at this point in time. On the international piece, I think some of it's simply driven by the strength of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team. Much of the international -- much of FIFA's marketplace is internationally, particularly Europe, and as that business continues to get stronger, you're going to see that skewing particularly in a quarter where Ultimate Team is so important where there's not as many new releases that'll skew the revenue to the international."

Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal '17, powered by flight of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and excitement for the new games we launched in Q2 and even more excited to the exceptional titles we've launched in Q3. As a result, we're raising our full year guidance to FY '17.
More than 43 million players engage in our breakthrough EA SPORTS games across consoles and mobile devices during Q2. On console, FIFA 17 has given soccer fans around the world a revolutionary new experience powered by our Frostbite engine. We introduce the journey, FIFA's first-ever story mode, which helped bring 20% more players into FIFA 17 in the first week of last year's game. To date, nearly 2/3 of all FIFA 17 players spanning 183 countries have engaged in this critically acclaimed new addition to the game.
The FIFA Ultimate Team experience is more robust than ever in FIFA 17, and engagement continues to grow through new modes and global competition. Players in the champions mode are now outcompeting to fair -- to a large tournament event, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team championship series. 
Madden NHL 17 players spent more time in the game in Q2 than any previous Madden title in the last 5 years, logging [ph] 44 million gameplay hours during the quarter. Ultimate Team also continues to grow in Madden NFL with engaged players in up nearly 20% year-over-year in Q2. Our Madden NFL competitive gaming season also kicked off in Q2 with the Madden classic, the first of 4 EA major Live Events in the Madden NFL championship series. 1.5 million fans played 5.8 million ranked games in online qualifying rounds, and the top 16 players will compete for the Madden classic championship in Los Angeles in early December. The holidays are always a great season for football, and we're looking forward to more fashion and engagement from our Madden NFL community in the months ahead.
EA SPORTS has been a leader in high-quality and emerging sports games across multiple platforms, and now we're delivering on that promise to mobile players as well. We now have top-performing mobile titles across 3 of our major sports franchises. Madden NFL mobile continues to grow year-over-year in both unique players and sessions per day. NBA Live Mobile has brought in more players than Madden NFL mobile did during its launch period. And FIFA Mobile hit #1 in the App Store free games chart in 138 countries, just after its early Q3 launch. 
Each of these experiences are long-term live services that will continue to grow and be tuned with expanding player base in this high-growth genre.
Strength in our mobile portfolio reaches across our other key genres. Our Action RPG,  Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, continues to drive strong levels of engagement with an average gameplay per player holding a 2.5 hours per day in Q2. One of the highest totals we've seen in a mobile game.
Our deep roster of live services on mobile, including The Sims replay, Sims City Builder and Real Racing 3, continued to deliver long-lasting entertainment. Mobile players today expect increasing levels of creativity depth and polished in the games they play. And as a result, only a few titles will break out.
With decades of rich experience building high-quality and immersive games, our portfolio of leading titles and a strong pipeline of new projects, we're well positioned for this evolution in mobile.
Throughout Q2, the energy around our 2 groundbreaking first-person shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, continue to build in anticipation of their Q3 launches. Battlefield 1 has impressed at every turn, from the debut trailer to subsequent looks at gameplay, features and single player stories, our Battlefield 1 content has over 100 million video views on YouTube, a record level for any EA game. The influencers shared hundreds of hours of gameplay captured from PlayStations around the world, bringing the world of Battlefield 1 to life in unprecedented depth.
DICE has redefined the shooter genre with Battlefield 1, which now stands as the most highly rated Battlefield game of this generation. Player engagements since launch on October 31 had been phenomenal. Battlefield 1's total player base for the first week was nearly double that of Battlefield 4.
Respawn has cemented Titanfall 4's position as one of the most exciting new IPs in the industry with a bold vision and accelerating action of Titanfall 2. This is a game that feels incredibly fluid and fulfilling to play. Critics agree that Titanfall 2 is a fantastic game with more than 40 top outlets from around the world, reading [ph] at 90 and above in reviews. The thrill of multiplayer in Titanfall 2 has the community buzzing, and rare reviews are also coming for the campaign as purpose and depth to the experience. Titanfall 2 has been called one of the year's must play titles and we're excited to see more fans across the world getting their hands on this extraordinary game. 
Heading into the holiday season that will include updated consoles and more mobile devices, Electronic Arts is in an outstanding position. With Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we now have 2 of the top-rated shooter games of this console generation engaging a broad audience of players.
Our EA SPORTS titles are delivering excitement for fans with thrilling new gameplay, challenges in Ultimate Team and dozens of new competitive gaming tournaments from the community level to the global stage.
Our mobile portfolio has a game for every player with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes and more. And we will also deliver our first virtual reality experience this holiday with the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One ex-wing VR mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed no limits on daydream Google's via platform.

27963,404416344,1069010,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reported non-GAAP metrics, but we'l",1759,"Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reported non-GAAP metrics, but we'll provide you with all the GAAP data you need to derive metrics comparable to our historical reported non-GAAP financials. 
In addition, to give more visibility into the performance of our business, we have decided to add a new operating performance metric, net sales. We define net sales as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold in physically in the period. Historical net sales have been added to our downloadable model posted on our website. In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that maybe applied to compare them with our historical non-GAAP results. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure to discuss the dynamics of our business.
We are very pleased with the strong second quarter, in particular, the great reception for FIFA 17 and the strength of our mobile portfolio. EA's GAAP net revenue was $898 million compared to $815 million last year. Net revenue was below our guidance by $17 million, however, the change in deferred net revenue was $40 million above our guidance at $200 million. If you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add GAAP revenue of $898 million to the change in deferred net revenue of $200 million. Thus although underlying sales were above our expectations because GAAP revenue is subject to the sales timing within the quarter, a larger portion of total sales were deferred into future quarters. The increase over last year's net revenue was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars battlefront in Q3 fiscal 2016 compared to smaller launches in Q3 fiscal 2015. See the documents we posted on our Investor Relations website on July 19 for details on how to compare these results to historically reported non-GAAP results.
Our cost of revenue was $401 million, including acquisition-related expenses of $12 million and $1 million worth of stock-based compensation. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3%, up 5.5 percentage points over last year. This reflects the strength of Star Wars Battlefront 3 quarters ago in fiscal Q3 -- or fiscal 2016. As I just mentioned, revenue deferred from Star Wars: Battlefront drove higher GAAP revenues in Q2 fiscal 2017 compared to the revenue deferrals from smaller titles launched in Q3 fiscal 2015. However, the cost of revenue in this Q2 and last year's Q2 were approximately the same, given that their respective launch dates were similar. Thus GAAP gross margin was up year-on-year. Operating expenses were $546 million, up $21 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by increased investment in R&D, particularly in new franchises and in our new player network infrastructure. The $20 million improvement on guidance was driven by timing of marketing activities. The $546 million includes $47 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses.
The resulting loss per share was $0.13, which is $0.04 better than our guidance due to lower costs. It's $0.32 better than last year. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include: The $200 million change in deferred net revenue, $13 million in acquisition-related expenses, $48 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and the cost of revenue and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that given our GAAP results with a loss, our share count was 301 million shares as GAAP requires us to exclude the estimated 13 million shares that might be issued in the future such as the shares expected to be issued this quarter for the settlement of the warrants. Those shares would be included in the diluted share count we -- had we reported a profit.
Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $109 million, up $100 million on last year. For the trailing 12 months, it was $1.1 billion. With capital expenditures of $120 million, free cash flow was $1 billion in the same period. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.
During Q2, we settled the remaining $136 million of our convertible notes. As a reminder, the warrants issued with our convertible notes are still outstanding, and starting on October 17, began to exercise automatically over 60 trading days. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway remains that our diluted share count already include the potential dilution at current share price.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $282 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015.
The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.27 billion, 43% of this balance is held onshore. This is down from 48% last quarter, the difference driven primarily by the share repurchase and convertible notes settlement.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion better than our expectations. Sales were driven by successful sports launches and growth in mobile. As discussed in our last call, FIFA 17 launched only 4 days from the end of the quarter, so almost no digital sales, whether downloads or Ultimate Team, were captured in the quarter. FIFA 16 launched 11 days before the end of Q2 2016, allowing a whole week of digital sales to be captured. Using the first 4 weeks of sales to make a through like-for-like comparison shows that FIFA fell-through is up 13% year-on-year, and this speaks to how the journey story mode has grown the market for our biggest franchise.
Digital net sales were $486 million, up $6 million on a year-ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in mobile and in digital downloads, offset by the FIFA timing I just mentioned.
The long-term trend towards digital is clear in net sales for the last 12 months, which were $2.6 billion or 57% of the total. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net sales in turn.
Extra content and freemium net sales were down nearly 12% year-on-year to $172 million, driven by the fact almost all of the first week of FIFA digitals sales will be captured in Q3 of this year. Using the first 4 weeks of Ultimate Team sales for FIFA 17 and FIFA 16 reveals year-on-year growth of 23%, even in the face of ongoing currency headwinds. Mobile net sales were $138 million in the quarter, up 22% year-on-year with growth led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We launched NBA Live Mobile in July and FIFA mobile after the quarter, and early indications from both titles are promising.
Net sales for our full game PC and console downloads were $93 million, up 4.5% over last year and in line with our expectations. Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $83 million to net sales flat year-on-year. Strong growth in EA Access and origin access were offset by declining revenue from some older titles.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to $4.775 billion in net revenue and $150 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.387 billion, including $31 million of acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation.
Operating expenses are expected to be $2.304 billion, including $198 million in stock-based compensation and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. This results in an earnings per share of $2.69 for the year, also an increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $150 million change in deferred net revenue, $200 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and cost of revenue, $37 million in acquisition-related costs, $2 million in debt-related expenses and a reduction of 1 million shares from the convertible bond hedge.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecasts of $1.2 billion.
We expect Q3 fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow quarter average. We anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. This reflects a modest increase in our expectations for the underlying business, primarily based on the early successes of FIFA 17. We're delighted with the way players are reacting to Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, both are reviewing very well, and we expect them to sell strongly for a long time. However, we're only a week into Battlefield in just a handful of data to Titanfall, so it's too early to update sales forecast for either. 
Guidance for the third quarter is for net revenue of $1.125 billion, including $910 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $532 million, including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses.
Opening expenses are expected to be $652 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.
Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises in our player network. This resulted in a diluted loss per share of $0.17 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derive measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $910 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $5 million in acquisition-related expenses.
We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $2.035 billion. This is up 13% year-on-year, driven by the combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. As you build models and make year-on-year comparisons, remember that the same timing issue that pushed FIFA digital sales into fiscal Q3 will also push some holiday sales into our fiscal Q4. 
In conclusion, with the new innovations in FIFA, we've increased the market size. In Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we have 2 extremely high quality games in place of a holiday season, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of successful mobile titles. Together, we expect them to deliver a record holiday quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

We're more very excited about both of them. I think there's a long opportunity, not just in the quarter, but for good 1 to 2 years to come. I remind people we had quite a few players still playing Battlefield 4 3 years after the game shift, right at the same time we shipped Battlefield 1. So deep engagements in that product. In terms of full game downloads and the script, we talked about growth of 4.5% in Q2, and I remind everyone that none of the digital business were FIFA within that number. So you should assume that we're seeing healthy growth and full game download at or above our expectation. And you should assume that early data on both Battlefield and Titanfall also is strong, mainly because the skewed towards PC of those games versus the battlefront [indiscernible] a year ago. So in general, we're very comfortable with the trends that we've put in place, and we continue to see consumers defaulting to what is the easiest way to buy products."

That's a huge positive for FIFA, and I think you can do lots of [indiscernible] to the size of the audience base for those 2 sports. I don't know those summers off the top of my head. But clearly, global football is a lot larger than American football. The counter to that is that mobile games tend to monetize very well in the West, and in particular monetize well in the U.S., that's driven by economics in the country. That means that there are places around the world where we do not expect FIFA to monetize anywhere near at the level that it does like it does here in the U.S. I think for us the long-term play is how do we build an engaging mechanic in mobile that provides access to the #1 sport in the world, to allow people to engage like they do in Ultimate Team on console, in places all around the world where they may not have access to a console or they may not be a console player. So that means large potential in all of Europe, both Western and eastern; large potential in Latin America where soccer is very strong; and obviously, a large potential in China. And our goal is to go after all of those markets with a very compelling service. The beauty of mobile as well as Andrew just mentioned is it can be tuned and trimmed, change the engagement models over time without having to build a whole new product. You don't have, like in the console business, the need to build a product every year. You're constantly updating mobile, and that provides us the ability to tailor the offering as we find what plays well in each mobile market. On the Mass Effect question, really our focus -- the way to think about it is our focuses on building great games. And right now Mass Effect is tracking extremely well. The game looks beautiful, and we're really pleased with this progress. However, as you've seen, we are willing to make loose and launch date if we feel it's necessary to deliver the right player experience. And our guidance assumes that Mass Effect continue to be in this year, but it gives us some flexibility that we might choose to move it either a week or 3 or 4 or 5 months if we have to based on what we want to measure in terms of delivering the right experience for the players. So no news on Mass Effect other than we continue to have it in our guidance, and the moment that changes will go certainly let everyone know."

Again, we've been doing competitive gaming for a number of years, but the energy that Peter and his team have brought to it has really taken it to the next level. What you heard in the prepared remarks, how strong we are going to both FIFA and Madden seasons, not focused on all aspects of the player journey from the grassroots level in qualifying tournaments through to a leads and a leap championships on a global stage. And we're very, very excited about what that is doing for engagement and now that is bringing new people into play, both our Madden and FIFA franchises. With the launch of Battlefield 1, as you can imagine, we are also looking deep into Battlefield 1 tournaments. We have run a lot of great tournaments with partners in Europe and in North America with Battlefield in the past. And with the launch now in place and the quality of the game so high, the team is working on some very specific game modes and features that will further enhance the competitive play of Battlefield 1 over the coming months and years."

We think the consumer experience is going to be great on both of those consoles, and -- but it's early because the selling season is really as we go between now and the end of the calendar year. Our internal estimate is still roughly 80 million unit by the end of calendar year and 100 million units by the end of next year, calendar year. And as I note, the installed base right now is 33% higher than the previous generation consoles for the first 35 months in the West. All of that bodes extremely well for the overall business. And that combined with the fact that I think you'll continue to see fantastic deals around bundling associated with the new consoles, the consumer is really going to get a great opportunity to increase or enter the next level of the gaming business that we've seen in a long time."

That's number one. Number two, Blake, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about R&D. Obviously, you have some titles you haven't unveiled yet as we look out towards fiscal '18.

So on the competitive nature, I mean, we've built into our guidance appropriate marketing spending. We do send [indiscernible] saw this quarter that they tend to be phasing from Q2 into Q3 certain programs. We decide on timing at the last minute. But in general, I think the core marketing focus, including traditional holiday promotions and all the activities around everything from Black Friday through the end of the calendar year, I think are pretty well baked in, reflected in our guidance. So I don't think you should see something different than that relative to our overall marketing spend. The -- in terms of R&D, we've talked I think publicly about roughly 25% of our R&D is for new products. Those new products could be brand-new IP such as we're building obviously a new studio in Montréal around Jane Raven. The team she's building there so we're hiring people for that studio. They'll be building a new action title for us. That's not next year or the following year. That will be 3 or 4 years out but obviously, we're spending money on that. We're spending money on building out around key sports properties that we have, adding things like The Journey into FIFA, for example. You'll see more of that type of work on existing products over time, and we're obviously building out on the Star Wars franchise that has proven to be very successful for us. You'll see new Star Wars product coming out in the future as well. So much of our 4 [ph] increases in R&D expenses have been all around those new opportunities as well as some new technologies. So obviously, investing in VR, investing in streaming technologies, investing in mobile, we're trying to make sure we are very focused on where the future is going and be able to be there when any new platforms developed or any shifts in platforms happen. And we think it's a prudent way to run the business. We try to make our biggest franchises as cost efficient as possible but at the same time, we're constantly investing in innovation around those to add new and exciting ways to play the game."

I'm not yet giving guidance for '18, so I want to be careful that we don't get overboard. But we're confident that we should be able to comp a strong year this year. One thing that people tend not to remember is when you have a title like a Battlefield or a Titanfall, those tend to sell extremely well in the catalog for at least another 12 to 24 months. And in the case of Battlefield, in particular, you have all the premium services kicking in next year. We won't see any of that in this year's revenue. So exciting times for big franchises like that and a huge opportunity for us to continue to monetize. We also believe our mobile business will continue to grow, which will obviously help in the comps year-over-year.

First is we see core purchase of the title continuing for much, much longer particularly of high-quality experiences with great social play dynamics like property like Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. And you should expect that we had planned for a longer marketing cycle around that. The second is we are using our network and investing more deeply in our network to drive cross-play of franchises within our network, and you should expect to see us continue to do that using the games that we already have in the marketplace to help introduce new players, new games that we know they love to play on their play patterns. And then the third is the live services that are wrapped around games active marketing in and of themselves. As every time we drive a new event around particular property as part of a live service, that acts as a beat that drives conversation and social channels about the games that we play.

Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal '17, powered by flight of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and player excitement",1002,"Thanks, Chris. Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal '17, powered by flight of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and player excitement for the new games we launched in Q2 and even more excited for the exceptional titles we have launched in Q3. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for FY '17.
More than 43 million players engaged in our breakthrough EA SPORTS games across consoles and mobile devices during Q2. On console, FIFA 17 has given soccer fans around the world a revolutionary new experience, powered by our Frostbite engine. We introduced The Journey, FIFA's first-ever story mode, which helped bring 20% more players into FIFA 17 in the first week of the last year's game. To date, nearly 2/3 of all FIFA 17 players spanning 183 countries have engaged in this critically acclaimed new addition to the game.
The FIFA Ultimate Team experience is more robust than ever in FIFA 17, and engagement continues to grow through new modes and global competitions. Players in the FUT Champions mode are now competing to advance to our live tournament event, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series.
Madden NFL 17 players spent more time in the game in Q2 than any previous Madden title in the last 5 years, logging 44 million gameplay hours during the quarter. Ultimate Team also continues to grow in Madden NFL, with engaged players in MUT up nearly 20% year-over-year in Q2. Our Madden NFL competitive gaming season also kicked off in Q2 with Madden Classic, the first of 4 EA major live events in the Madden NFL Championship Series. 1.5 million fans played 5.8 million ranked games in the online qualifying rounds, and the top 16 players will compete for the Madden Classic Championship in Los Angeles in early December. The holidays are always a great season for football, and we're looking forward to more passion and engagement from our Madden NFL community in the months ahead.
EA SPORTS has been a leader in high-quality and emerging sports games across multiple platforms, and now we're delivering on that promise to mobile players as well. We now have top-performing mobile titles across 3 of our major sports franchises. Madden NFL Mobile continues to grow year-over-year in both unique players and sessions per day. NBA Live Mobile has brought in more players than Madden NFL Mobile did during its launch period. And FIFA Mobile hit #1 in the App Store Free Games chart in 138 countries just after its early Q3 launch. Each of these experiences are long-term live services that will continue to grow and be tuned with the expanding player base in this high-growth genre.
Strength in our mobile portfolio reaches across our other key genres. Our action RPG, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, continues to drive strong levels of engagement, with average gameplay per player holding 2.5 hours per day in Q2, one of the highest totals we've seen in a mobile game.
Our deep roster of live services on mobile, including The Sims FreePlay, SimCity BuildIt and Real Racing 3, continued to deliver long-lasting entertainment. Mobile players today expect increasing levels of creativity, depth and polish in the games they play. And as a result, only a few titles will break out.
With decades of rich experience building high-quality and immersive games, our portfolio of leading titles and a strong pipeline of new projects were well positioned for this evolution in mobile.
Throughout Q2, the energy around our 2 groundbreaking first-person shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, continued to build in anticipation of their Q3 launches. Battlefield 1 has impressed at every turn. From the debut trailer to subsequent looks at gameplay, features and single player stories, our Battlefield 1 content has over 100 million video views on YouTube, a record level for any EA game. Community influencers shared hundreds of hours of gameplay captured from PlayStations around the world, bringing the world of Battlefield 1 to life in unprecedented depth.
DICE has redefined the shooter genre with Battlefield 1, which now stands as the most highly rated Battlefield game of this generation. Player engagements since the launch on October 31 had been phenomenal. Battlefield 1's total player base for the first week was nearly double that of Battlefield 4.
Respawn has cemented Titanfall's position as one of the most exciting new IPs in the industry with the bold vision and accelerating action of Titanfall 2. This is a game that feels incredibly fluid and fulfilling to play. Critics agree that Titanfall 2 is a fantastic game with more than 40 top outlets from around the world, rating at 90 and above in reviews. The thrill of multiplayer in Titanfall 2 has the community buzzing, and rare reviews are also coming for the campaign that adds purpose and depth to the experience. Titanfall 2 has been called one of the year's must-play titles, and we're excited to see more fans across the world getting their hands on this extraordinary game.
Heading into the holiday season that will include updated consoles and more mobile devices, Electronic Arts is in an outstanding position. With Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we now have 2 of the top-rated shooter games of this console generation engaging a broad audience of players.
Our EA SPORTS titles are delivering excitement for fans with thrilling new gameplay, challenges in Ultimate Team and dozens of new competitive gaming tournaments from the community level to the global stage.
Our mobile portfolio has a game for every player with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes and more. And we will also deliver our first virtual reality experience this holiday with the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits on Daydream, Google's VR platform. We're looking forward to another strong quarter ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,404416344,1069227,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'",1765,"Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'll provide you with all the GAAP data you need to derive metrics comparable to our historical reported non-GAAP financials. 
In addition, to give more visibility into the performance of our business, we have decided to add a new operating performance metric: net sales. We define net sales as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold physically in the period. Historical net sales have been added to our downloadable model posted on our website. 
In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with our historical non-GAAP results. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure to discuss the dynamics of our business.
We are very pleased with the strong second quarter, in particular, the great reception for FIFA 17 and the strength of our mobile portfolio. EA's GAAP net revenue was $898 million compared to $815 million last year. Net revenue was below our guidance by $17 million. However, the change in deferred net revenue was $40 million above our guidance at $200 million. If you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add GAAP revenue of $898 million to the change in deferred net revenue of $200 million. Thus, although underlying sales were above our expectations because GAAP revenue is subject to the sales timing within the quarter, a larger portion of the total sales were deferred into future quarters. The increase over last year's net revenue was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 fiscal 2016 compared to smaller launches in Q3 fiscal 2015. See the document we posted on our Investor Relations website on July 19 for details on how to compare these results to historically reported non-GAAP results.
Our cost of revenue was $401 million, including acquisition-related expenses of $12 million and $1 million worth of stock-based compensation. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3%, up 5.5 percentage points over last year. This reflects the strength of Star Wars Battlefront 3 quarters ago in fiscal Q3 -- or fiscal 2016. As I just mentioned, revenue deferred from Star Wars Battlefront drove higher GAAP revenues in Q2 fiscal 2017 compared to the revenue deferrals from smaller titles launched in Q3 fiscal 2015. However, the cost of revenue this Q2 and last year's Q2 were approximately the same, given that their respective launch slates were similar. Thus, GAAP gross margin was up year-on-year. Operating expenses were $546 million, up $21 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by increased investments in R&D, particularly in new franchises and in our new player network infrastructure. The $20 million improvement on guidance was driven by timing of marketing activities. The $546 million includes $47 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses.
The resulting loss per share was $0.13, which is $0.04 better than our guidance due to lower costs. It is $0.32 better than last year. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $200 million change in deferred net revenue; $13 million in acquisition-related expenses; $48 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and the cost of revenue; and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that given our GAAP result with a loss, our share count was 301 million shares as GAAP requires us to exclude the estimated 13 million shares that might be issued in the future such as the shares expected to be issued this quarter for the settlement of the warrants. Those shares would be included in the diluted share count we -- had we reported a profit.
Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $109 million, up $100 million on last year's. For the trailing 12 months, it was $1.1 billion. With capital expenditures of $120 million, free cash flow was $1 billion in the same period. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.
During Q2, we settled the remaining $136 million of our convertible notes. As a reminder, the warrants issued with our convertible notes are still outstanding and, starting on October 17, began to exercise automatically over 60 trading days. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway remains that our diluted share count already includes the potential dilution at the current share price.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $282 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.27 billion. 43% of this balance is held onshore. This is down from 48% last quarter, the difference driven primarily by the share repurchase and convertible notes settlement.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion better than our expectations. Sales were driven by successful sports launches and growth in mobile. As discussed in our last call, FIFA 17 launched only 4 days from the end of the quarter. So almost no digital sales, whether downloads or Ultimate Team, were captured in the quarter. FIFA 16 launched 11 days before the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, allowing a whole week of digital sales to be captured. Using the first 4 weeks of sales to make a true like-for-like comparison shows that FIFA sell-through is up 13% year-on-year. And this speaks to how The Journey story mode has grown the market for our biggest franchise.
Digital net sales were $486 million, up $6 million on the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in mobile and in digital downloads, offset by the FIFA timing I just mentioned.
The long-term trend towards digital is clear in net sales for the last 12 months, which were $2.6 billion or 57% of the total. 
Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net sales in turn.
Extra content and freemium net sales were down nearly 12% year-on-year to $172 million, driven by the fact that almost all of the first week of FIFA digitals sales will be captured in Q3 of this year. Using the first 4 weeks of Ultimate Team sales for FIFA 17 and FIFA 16 reveals year-on-year growth of 23%, even in the face of ongoing currency headwinds. 
Mobile net sales were $138 million in the quarter, up 22% year-on-year, with growth led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We launched NBA Live Mobile in July and FIFA Mobile after the quarter end, and early indications from both titles are promising.
Net sales for our full game PC and console downloads were $93 million, up 4.5% over last year and in line with our expectations. Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $83 million to net sales, flat year-on-year. Strong growth in EA Access and Origin Access were offset by decline in revenue from some older titles.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to $4.775 billion in net revenue and $150 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.387 billion, including $31 million of acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation.
Operating expenses are expected to be $2.304 billion, including $198 million in stock-based compensation and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. This results in an earnings per share of $2.69 for the year, also an increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $150 million change in deferred net revenue; $200 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and cost of revenue; $37 million in acquisition-related costs; $2 million in debt-related expenses; and a reduction of 1 million shares from the convertible bond hedge.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of $1.2 billion.
We expect Q3 fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow quarter ever. We anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. This reflects a modest increase in our expectations for the underlying business, primarily based on the early successes of FIFA 17. We're delighted with the way players are reacting to Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Both are reviewing very well, and we expect them to sell strongly for a long time. However, we're only a week into Battlefield and just a handful of days into Titanfall. So it's too early to update sales forecast for either.
Guidance for the third quarter is for net revenue of $1.125 billion, including $910 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $532 million, including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses.
Operating expenses are expected to be $652 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.
Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises in our player network. This resulted to a diluted loss per share of $0.17 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derive measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $910 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $5 million in acquisition-related expenses.
We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $2.035 billion. This is up 13% year-on-year, driven by the combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. As you build models and make year-on-year comparisons, remember that the same timing issue that pushed FIFA digital sales into fiscal Q3 will also push some holiday sales into our fiscal Q4.
In conclusion, with the new innovations in FIFA, we have increased the market size. In Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we have 2 extremely high-quality games in place for the holiday season, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of successful mobile titles. Together, we expect them to deliver a record holiday quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

The power of our Frostbite engine enables us to scale with platform capabilities to deliver the experiences our players want. From the groundbreaking gameplay in Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, to Mass Effect: Andromeda and Stunning 4K, to extraordinary new VR experiences from our lab teams across the spectrum of high-end and lower-end devices, we are pushing our boundaries in a multi-platform world.
The evolution of mobile games is another growth factor, where the tenets have great mobile experiences and great HD games continue to converge and open new high-growth opportunities.
In this increasingly competitive world where the number of players and the number of games grows on a daily basis, players are looking to major brands as markets for quality. The expectations for creativity, innovation, polish and depth play directly to our strengths. Our EA sports titles are strong demonstrations of social play blended with strategy and action that have proven to deeply engage mobile players over time. We will continue to infuse this same approach throughout our pipeline of new mobile experiences in development for the quarters ahead.
Players today also have more ways to connect and engage with the games they love. Millions of fans that can be competing in our global Madden NFL 17 and FIFA 17 competitions, beginning with in-game qualifications and leaderboards that will ultimately see championship events on a world stage.
In-game competitions have kicked off for Madden Bowl, our second EA major event for Madden. And season one of the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series is underway, which will culminate with the FIFA Interactive World Cup in August 2017.
Beyond competitive gaming, we're introducing new tools for our community to create content and share more of the amazing experiences they have in games like Battlefield 1. And building on the continued success of EA Access and Origin Access, we're exploring ways to provide subscription choices for more of our players.
In an ever-changing world defined by more content, more devices and an increasingly global player base, finding great games and connecting with friends becomes increasingly challenging. We are continuing to invest in our EA player network to reduce friction and improve discovery, purchase and enjoyment across all of our games and player touch points. The player experience as you enter Battlefield 1 is a good example of how this is beginning to roll out, with a new consistent interface that brings players into their personal Battlefield universe with the games they are in, content recommendations and faster ways to score up with their friends. The player network will grow and attract more players with these personalized services, in game and out of game, to add value and improve the experience with every minute of play.

Can you just talk about how, if at all, those expectations have changed in the context of your raised guidance? And then just second question. I know it's still very early days here, but just trying to get a sense of maybe how the digital download mix of Battlefield 1 is trending relative to Star Wars.

And while there's incredible excitement around both, we just don't want -- we don't want everyone to get ahead of themselves in the case of focusing on unit forecast. But don't take that as a negative on either product. We're very excited about both of them. And I think there's a long opportunity not just in the quarter, but for a good 1 to 2 years to come. I remind people we had quite a few players still playing Battlefield 4 3 years after the game shift right at the same time we shift Battlefield 1. So deep engagement in that product. In terms of full game downloads, in the script, we talked about growth of 4.5% in Q2. And I remind everyone that none of the digital business for FIFA was in that number. And so you should assume that we're seeing healthy growth in full game downloads at or above our expectations. And you should assume that the early data on both Battlefield and Titanfall also is strong, mainly because of the skew towards PC of those games versus, say, Battlefront for the year ago. So in general, we're very comfortable with the trend that we've put in place, and we continue to see consumers defaulting to what is the easiest way to buy products."

And I think you could do lots of stats to the size of the audience base for those 2 sports. I don't know those numbers off the top of my head, but clearly, global football is a lot larger than American football. The counter to that is that mobile games tend to monetize very well in the West and, in particular, monetize well in the U.S., and that's driven by economics in the country. That means that there are places around the world where we do not expect FIFA to monetize anywhere near at the level that it does what Madden does here in the U.S. I think for us, the long-term play is how do we build an engaging mechanic in mobile that provides access to the #1 sport in the world to allow people to engage like they do in Ultimate Team on console in places all around the world where they may not have access to a console or they may not be a console player. So that means large potential in all of Europe, both western and eastern; large potential in Latin America where soccer is very strong; and obviously, a large potential in China. And our goal is to go after all of those markets with a very compelling service. The beauty of mobile as well as Andrew just mentioned is it can be tuned and, I think, change the engagement models over time without having to build a whole new product. You don't have, like in the console business, the need to build a product every year. You're constantly updating mobile, and that provides us the ability to tailor the offering as we find what plays well in each local market. On the Mass Effect question, really, our focus -- the way to think about it is our focus is on building great games. And right now, Mass Effect is tracking extremely well. The game looks beautiful, and we're really pleased with its progress. However, as you've seen, we are willing to make moves in launch dates if we feel it's necessary to deliver the right player experience. And our guidance assumes that Mass Effect continue to be in this year, but it gives us some flexibility that we might choose to move it either a week or 3 or 4 or 5 months, if we have to, based on what we want to make sure in terms of delivering the right experience for the player. So no news on Mass Effect other than we continue to have it in our guidance. And at the moment that changes, we'll certainly let everyone know."

Again, as we talked about coming into this, the first-person shooter category is a very large category. One of the largest.

We believe that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, while they have some overlap fulfill very different motivations in what a player is looking for. And so we think there's really 3 types of players: People that really love Battlefield and that type of big strategic gameplay that will orient in that direction; the player that loves the fast, fluid, kinetic gameplay of Titanfall 2 and really oriented in that direction; and the player that just have to play the 2 greatest shooters this year and will buy both. And again, we're very, very excited about the quality in both titles. We believe they both will have a long sales cycle both this quarter through the festive season and deep into the years to come.

So on the competitive nature, I think we've built into our guidance the appropriate marketing spending.

So I don't think you should see something different than that relative to our overall marketing spend. The -- in terms of R&D, we've talked I think publicly about roughly 25% of our R&D is for new products. Those new products could be brand-new IP such as we're building obviously a new studio in Montréal around Jade Raymond and the team she's building there, so we're hiring people for that studio. They'll be building a new action title for us. That's not next year or the following year. That will be 3 or 4 years out but obviously, we're spending money on that. We're spending money on building out around key sports properties that we have, adding things like The Journey into FIFA, for example. You'll see more of that type of work on existing products over time, and we're obviously building out on the Star Wars franchise that has proven to be very successful for us. You'll see new Star Wars product coming out in the future as well. So much of our core increases in R&D expenses have been all around those new opportunities as well as some new technologies. So obviously, investing in VR, investing in streaming technologies, investing in mobile. We're trying to make sure we are very focused on where the future is going and be able to be there when any new platform's developed or any shifts in platforms happen. And we think it's a prudent way to run the business. We try to make our biggest franchises as cost efficient as possible, but at the same time, we're constantly investing in innovation around those to add new and exciting ways to play the game."

One thing that people tend not to remember is when you have a title like a Battlefield or a Titanfall, those tend to sell extremely well in the catalog for at least another 12 to 24 months. And in the case of Battlefield, in particular, you have all the premium services kicking in next year. We won't see any of that in this year's revenue.

First is we see core purchase of the title continuing for much, much longer particularly of high-quality experiences with great social play dynamics like properties like Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. And you should expect that we had planned for a longer marketing cycle around that. The second is we are using our network and investing more deeply in our network to drive cross-play of franchises within our network, and you should expect to see us continue to do that using the games that we already have in the marketplace to help introduce new players to new games that we know they love to play on their play patterns. And then the third is the live services that are wrapped around games' active marketing in and of themselves. As every time we drive a new event around a particular property as part of a live service, that acts as a beat that drives conversation and social channels about the games that we play. So as we think about an elongated initial marketing cycle as we think about the power of our network and the amount of players that we have in it playing every day and we think about the large services that we have wrapped, we are really transforming how we market our games and believe we're getting much, much stronger ROI on every dollar spent."

And the whole construct of how they put that plan together is receiving really positive feedback from that community. As we think more broadly about how that impacts other games, again, we have a big and diverse portfolio with a growing and diverse player base.

Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal '17, powered by a slate of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and player excitement for the new games we launched in Q2 and even more excited for the exceptional titles we have launched in Q3. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for FY '17.
More than 43 million players engaged in our breakthrough EA SPORTS games across consoles and mobile devices during Q2. On console, FIFA 17 has given soccer fans around the world a revolutionary new experience, powered by our Frostbite engine. We introduced The Journey, FIFA's first-ever story mode, which helped bring 20% more players into FIFA 17 in the first week of the last year's game. To date, nearly 2/3 of all FIFA 17 players, spanning 183 countries, have engaged in this critically acclaimed new addition to the game.
The FIFA Ultimate Team experience is more robust than ever in FIFA 17, and engagement continues to grow through new modes and global competitions. Players in the FUT Champions mode are now competing to advance to our live tournament event, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series.
Madden NFL 17 players spent more time in the game in Q2 than any previous Madden title in the last 5 years, logging 44 million gameplay hours during the quarter. Ultimate Team also continues to grow in Madden NFL, with engaged players in MUT up nearly 20% year-over-year in Q2. Our Madden NFL competitive gaming season also kicked off in Q2 with the Madden Classic, the first of 4 EA major live events in the Madden NFL Championship Series. 1.5 million fans played 5.8 million ranked games in the online qualifying rounds, and the top 16 players will compete for the Madden Classic Championship in Los Angeles in early December. The holidays are always a great season for football, and we're looking forward to more passion and engagement from our Madden NFL community in the months ahead.
EA SPORTS has been a leader in high-quality and emerging sports games across multiple platforms, and now we're delivering on that promise to mobile players as well. We now have top-performing mobile titles across 3 of our major sports franchises. Madden NFL Mobile continues to grow year-over-year in both unique players and sessions per day. NBA Live Mobile has brought in more players than Madden NFL Mobile did during its launch period. And FIFA Mobile hit #1 in the App Store Free Games chart in 138 countries just after its early Q3 launch. Each of these experiences are long-term live services that will continue to grow and be tuned with the expanding player base in this high-growth genre.
Strength in our mobile portfolio reaches across other key genres. Our action RPG, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, continues to drive strong levels of engagement, with average gameplay per player holding at 2.5 hours per day in Q2, one of the highest totals we've seen in a mobile game.
Our deep roster of live services on mobile, including The Sims FreePlay, SimCity BuildIt and Real Racing 3, continue to deliver long-lasting entertainment. Mobile players today expect increasing levels of creativity, depth and polish in the games they play. And as a result, only a few titles will break out.
With decades of rich experience building high-quality and immersive games, our portfolio of leading titles and a strong pipeline of new projects, we're well positioned for this evolution in mobile.
Throughout Q2, the energy around our 2 groundbreaking first-person shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, continued to build in anticipation of their Q3 launches. Battlefield 1 has impressed at every turn. From the debut trailer to subsequent looks at gameplay, features and single player stories, our Battlefield 1 content has over 100 million video views on YouTube, a record level for any EA game. Community influencers shared hundreds of hours of gameplay captured from PlayStations around the world, bringing the world of Battlefield 1 to life in unprecedented depth.
DICE has redefined the shooter genre with Battlefield 1, which now stands as the most highly rated Battlefield game of this generation. Player engagement since the launch on October 31 had been phenomenal. Battlefield 1's total player base for the first week was nearly double that of Battlefield 4.
Respawn has cemented Titanfall's position as one of the most exciting new IPs in the industry with the bold vision and accelerating action of Titanfall 2. This is a game that feels incredibly fluid and fulfilling to play. Critics agree that Titanfall 2 is a fantastic game, with more than 40 top outlets from around the world rating at 90 and above in reviews. The thrill of multiplayer in Titanfall 2 has the community buzzing, and rave reviews are also coming for the campaign that adds purpose and depth to the experience. Titanfall 2 has been called one of the year's must-play titles, and we're excited to see more fans across the world getting their hands on this extraordinary game.
Heading into the holiday season that will include updated consoles and more mobile devices, Electronic Arts is in an outstanding position. With Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we now have 2 of the top-rated shooter games of this console generation engaging a broad audience of players.
Our EA SPORTS titles are delivering excitement for fans with thrilling new gameplay, challenges in Ultimate Team and dozens of new competitive gaming tournaments from the community level to the global stage.
Our mobile portfolio has a game for every player with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes and more. And we will also deliver our first virtual reality experience this holiday with the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits on Daydream, Google's VR platform. We're looking forward to another strong quarter ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,404416344,1069260,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'",1764,"Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'll provide you with all the GAAP data you need to derive metrics comparable to our historical reported non-GAAP financials. 
In addition, to give more visibility into the performance of our business, we have decided to add a new operating performance metric: net sales. We define net sales as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Historical net sales have been added to our downloadable model posted on our website. 
In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with our historical non-GAAP results. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure to discuss the dynamics of our business.
We are very pleased with the strong second quarter, in particular, the great reception for FIFA 17 and the strength of our mobile portfolio. EA's GAAP net revenue was $898 million compared to $815 million last year. Net revenue was below our guidance by $17 million. However, the change in deferred net revenue was $40 million above our guidance at $200 million. If you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add GAAP revenue of $898 million to the change in deferred net revenue of $200 million. Thus, although underlying sales were above our expectations, because GAAP revenue is subject to the sales timing within the quarter, a larger portion of the total sales were deferred into future quarters. The increase over last year's net revenue was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 fiscal 2016 compared to smaller launches in Q3 fiscal 2015. See the document we posted on our Investor Relations website on July 19 for details on how to compare these results to historically reported non-GAAP results.
Our cost of revenue was $401 million, including acquisition-related expenses of $12 million and $1 million worth of stock-based compensation. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3%, up 5.5 percentage points over last year. This reflects the strength of Star Wars Battlefront 3 quarters ago in fiscal Q3 -- or fiscal 2016. As I just mentioned, revenue deferred from Star Wars Battlefront drove higher GAAP revenues in Q2 fiscal 2017 compared to the revenue deferrals from smaller titles launched in Q3 fiscal 2015. However, the cost of revenue this Q2 and last year's Q2 were approximately the same, given that their respective launch slates were similar. Thus, GAAP gross margin was up year-on-year. Operating expenses were $546 million, up $21 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by increased investments in R&D, particularly in new franchises and in our new Player Network infrastructure. The $20 million improvement on guidance was driven by timing of marketing activities. The $546 million includes $47 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses.
The resulting loss per share was $0.13, which is $0.04 better than our guidance due to lower costs. It is $0.32 better than last year. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $200 million change in deferred net revenue, $13 million in acquisition-related expenses, $48 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and the cost of revenue, and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that given our GAAP result was a loss, our share count was 301 million shares as GAAP requires us to exclude the estimated 13 million shares that might be issued in the future such as the shares expected to be issued this quarter for the settlement of the warrants. Those shares would be included in the diluted share count we -- had we reported a profit.
Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $109 million, up $100 million on last year. For the trailing 12 months, it was $1.1 billion. With capital expenditures of $120 million, free cash flow was $1 billion in the same period. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.
During Q2, we settled the remaining $136 million of our convertible notes. As a reminder, the warrants issued with our convertible notes are still outstanding and, starting on October 17, began to exercise automatically over 60 trading days. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway remains that our diluted share count already includes the potential dilution at the current share price.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $282 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.27 billion. 43% of this balance is held onshore. This is down from 48% last quarter, the difference driven primarily by the share repurchase and convertible notes settlement.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion better than our expectations. Sales were driven by successful sports launches and growth in mobile. As discussed in our last call, FIFA 17 launched only 4 days from the end of the quarter. So almost no digital sales, whether downloads or Ultimate Team, were captured in the quarter. FIFA 16 launched 11 days before the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, allowing a whole week of digital sales to be captured. Using the first 4 weeks of sales to make a true like-for-like comparison shows that FIFA sell-through is up 13% year-on-year. And this speaks to how The Journey story mode has grown the market for our biggest franchise.
Digital net sales were $486 million, up $6 million on the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in mobile and in digital downloads, offset by the FIFA timing I just mentioned.
The long-term trend towards digital is clear in net sales for the last 12 months, which were $2.6 billion or 57% of the total. 
Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net sales in turn.
Extra content and freemium net sales were down nearly 12% year-on-year to $172 million, driven by the fact that almost all of the first week of FIFA digital sales will be captured in Q3 of this year. Using the first 4 weeks of Ultimate Team sales for FIFA 17 and FIFA 16 reveals year-on-year growth of 23%, even in the face of ongoing currency headwinds. 
Mobile net sales were $138 million in the quarter, up 22% year-on-year, with growth led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We launched NBA Live Mobile in July and FIFA Mobile after the quarter-end, and early indications from both titles are promising.
Net sales for our full game PC and console downloads were $93 million, up 4.5% over last year and in line with our expectations. Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $83 million to net sales, flat year-on-year. Strong growth in EA Access and Origin Access were offset by decline in revenue from some older titles.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to $4.775 billion in net revenue and $150 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.387 billion, including $31 million of acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation.
Operating expenses are expected to be $2.304 billion, including $198 million in stock-based compensation and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. This results in an earnings per share of $2.69 for the year, also an increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $150 million change in deferred net revenue, $200 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and cost of revenue, $37 million in acquisition-related costs, $2 million in debt-related expenses, and a reduction of 1 million shares from the convertible bond hedge.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of $1.2 billion.
We expect Q3 fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow quarter ever. We anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. This reflects a modest increase in our expectations for the underlying business, primarily based on the early successes of FIFA 17. We're delighted with the way players are reacting to Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Both are reviewing very well, and we expect them to sell strongly for a long time. However, we're only a week into Battlefield and just a handful of days into Titanfall. So it's too early to update sales forecasts for either.
Guidance for the third quarter is for net revenue of $1.125 billion, including $910 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $532 million, including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses.
Operating expenses are expected to be $652 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.
Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises and our Player Network. This resulted to a diluted loss per share of $0.17 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derive measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $910 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $5 million in acquisition-related expenses.
We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $2.035 billion. This is up 13% year-on-year, driven by the combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. As you build models and make year-on-year comparisons, remember that the same timing issue that pushed FIFA digital sales into fiscal Q3 will also push some holiday sales into our fiscal Q4.
In conclusion, with the new innovations in FIFA, we have increased the market size. In Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we have 2 extremely high-quality games in place for the holiday season, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of successful mobile titles. Together, we expect them to deliver a record holiday quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

The audience for high-quality games on HD consoles and PC continues to expand. We believe the new console options will add depth to the hardware cycle, grow the installed base and add to the player value proposition.
The power of our Frostbite engine enables us to scale with platform capabilities to deliver the experiences our players want. From the groundbreaking gameplay in Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, to Mass Effect: Andromeda in stunning 4K, to extraordinary new VR experiences from our lab teams across the spectrum of high-end and lower-end devices, we are pushing our boundaries in a multi-platform world.
The evolution of mobile games is another growth vector, where the tenets of great mobile experiences and great HD games continue to converge and open new high-growth opportunities.
In this increasingly competitive world where the number of players and the number of games grows on a daily basis, players are looking to major brands as markets for quality. The expectations for creativity, innovation, polish and depth play directly to our strengths. Our EA SPORTS titles are strong demonstrations of social play blended with strategy and action that have proven to deeply engage mobile players over time. We will continue to infuse this same approach throughout our pipeline of new mobile experiences in development for the quarters ahead.
Players today also have more ways to connect and engage with the games they love. Millions of fans that can be competing in our global Madden NFL 17 and FIFA 17 competitions, beginning with in-game qualifications and leaderboards that will ultimately see championship events on a world stage.
In-game competitions have kicked off for Madden Bowl, our second EA major event for Madden. And season one of the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series is underway, which will culminate with the FIFA Interactive World Cup in August 2017.
Beyond competitive gaming, we're introducing new tools for our community to create content and share more of the amazing experiences they have in games like Battlefield 1. And building on the continued success of EA Access and Origin Access, we're exploring ways to provide subscription choices for more of our players.
In an ever-changing world defined by more content, more devices and an increasingly global player base, finding great games and connecting with friends becomes increasingly challenging. We are continuing to invest in our EA Player Network to reduce friction and improve discovery, purchase and enjoyment across all of our games and player touch points. The player experience as you enter Battlefield 1 is a good example of how this is beginning to roll out, with a new consistent interface that brings players into their personal Battlefield universe with the games they own, content recommendations and faster ways to squad up with their friends. The Player Network will grow and attract more players with these personalized services, in game and out of game, that add value and improve the experience with every minute of play.
We're energized to induce -- introduce our players to new experiences, new connections and new ways to play.

And while there's incredible excitement around both, we just don't want -- we don't want everyone to get ahead of themselves in the case of focusing on unit forecasts. But don't take that as a negative on either product. We're very excited about both of them and think there's a long opportunity not just in the quarter, but for a good 1 to 2 years to come. I remind people we had quite a few players still playing Battlefield 4 3 years after the game shipped right up until the time we shipped Battlefield 1. So deep engagement in that product. In terms of full game downloads, in the script, we talked about growth of 4.5% in Q2. And I remind everyone that none of the digital business for FIFA was in that number. And so you should assume that we're seeing healthy growth in full game downloads at or above our expectations. And you should assume that the early data on both Battlefield and Titanfall also is strong, mainly because the skew towards PC of those games versus, say, Battlefront was a year ago. So in general, we're very comfortable with the trend that we've put in place, and we continue to see consumers defaulting to what is the easiest way to buy products."

It's too early for us to be able to say that would mean more people are in the funnel or more people spending more. It's just early in the season to be able to say that. But we're very confident that people continue to enjoy the game mode and have found that to be a very highly engaging way to continue to come back and play FIFA every day or every week. And so we're optimistic about where that's going, but yet unable to know exactly what the stats are driving the underlying business."

And I think you could do lots of stats as to the size of the audience base for those 2 sports. I don't know those numbers off the top of my head, but clearly, global football is a lot larger than American football. The counter to that is that mobile games tend to monetize very well in the West and, in particular, monetize well in the U.S., and that's driven by economics in the country. That means that there are places around the world where we do not expect FIFA to monetize anywhere near at the level that it does -- what Madden does here in the U.S. I think for us, the long-term play is how do we build an engaging mechanic in mobile that provides access to the #1 sport in the world to allow people to engage like they do in Ultimate Team on console in places all around the world where they may not have access to a console or they may not be a console player. So that means large potential in all of Europe, both western and eastern; large potential in Latin America, where soccer is very strong; and obviously, a large potential in China. And our goal is to go after all of those markets with a very compelling service. The beauty of mobile as well, as Andrew just mentioned, is it can be tuned and change the engagement models over time without having to build a whole new product. You don't have, like in the console business, the need to build a product every year. You're constantly updating mobile, and that provides us the ability to tailor the offering as we find what plays well in each local market. On the Mass Effect question, really, our focus -- the way to think about it is our focus is on building great games. And right now, Mass Effect is tracking extremely well. The game looks beautiful, and we're really pleased with its progress. However, as you've seen, we are willing to make moves in launch dates if we feel it's necessary to deliver the right player experience. And our guidance assumes that Mass Effect continues to be in this year, but it gives us some flexibility that we might choose to move it either a week or 3 or 4 or 5 months, if we have to, based on what we want to make sure in terms of delivering the right experience for the player. So no news on Mass Effect other than we continue to have it in our guidance. And at the moment that changes, we'll certainly let everyone know."

We believe that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, while they have some overlap, fulfill very different motivations in what a player is looking for. And so we think there's really 3 types of players: people that really love Battlefield and that type of big strategic gameplay that will orient in that direction; the player that loves the fast, fluid, kinetic gameplay of Titanfall 2 and really orient in that direction; and the player that just has to play the 2 greatest shooters this year and will buy both.

So on the competitive nature, I think we've built into our guidance the appropriate marketing spending. We do tend to see, as you saw this quarter, there can tend to be phasing from Q2 into Q3.

We do tend to see, as you saw this quarter, there can tend to be phasing from Q2 into Q3. Certain programs, we decide on timing at the last minute. But in general, I think the core marketing focus, including traditional holiday promotions and all the activities around everything from Black Friday through the end of the calendar year, I think are pretty well baked in, reflected in our guidance. So I don't think you should see something different than that relative to our overall marketing spend. The -- in terms of R&D, we've talked I think publicly about roughly 25% of our R&D is for new products. Those new products could be brand-new IP such as we're building obviously a new studio in Montréal around Jade Raymond and the team she's building there, so we're hiring people for that studio. They'll be building a new action title for us. That's not next year or the following year. That will be 3 or 4 years out, but obviously, we're spending money on that. We're spending money on building out around key sports properties that we have, adding things like The Journey into FIFA, for example. You'll see more of that type of work on existing products over time, and we're obviously building out on the Star Wars franchise that has proven to be very successful for us. You'll see new Star Wars product coming out in the future as well. So much of our core increases in R&D expenses have been all around those new opportunities as well as some new technologies. So obviously, investing in VR, investing in streaming technologies, investing in mobile. We're trying to make sure we are very focused on where the future is going and be able to be there when any new platform's developed or any shifts in platforms happen. And we think it's a prudent way to run the business. We try to make our biggest franchises as cost efficient as possible, but at the same time, we're constantly investing in innovation around those to add new and exciting ways to play the games."

I was wondering if you could talk about what would be reasonable to expect as we look into fiscal '18. I guess, does it make sense to assume a Star Wars Battlefront title next year that could offset Battlefield 1 this year? And I think you just mentioned that the new action title in the works probably won't hit next year to offset Titanfall 2. So how should we think about comping Titanfall 2? Maybe a strong digital growth there or something that helps to offset that? But basically how does this good year in fiscal '17 impact growth rates in fiscal '18?"

We talked about an action title that's not yet announced, but we're very excited, and that's a good chance that, that will fall into fiscal '18. I'm not yet giving guidance for '18, so I want to be careful that we don't get overboard. But we're confident that we should be able to comp a strong year this year. One thing that people tend not to remember is when you have a title like a Battlefield or a Titanfall, those tend to sell extremely well in the catalog for at least another 12 to 24 months. And in the case of Battlefield, in particular, you have all the premium services kicking in next year. We won't see any of that in this year's revenue. So exciting times for our big franchises like that and huge opportunities for us to continue to monetize. We also believe our mobile business will continue to grow, which will obviously help in the comps year-over-year. And our live services businesses continue to get stronger and things like our FIFA Online business in Asia. Our goal is to try to grow all of those to help offset what could be a great year this year."

And then secondly, Blake, you mentioned that you earned the right to look at potential acquisitions, but we haven't seen a lot. What type of deals are you focused on now? Is it mostly price that's holding those up? And finally, just a quick clarity point. Did I hear you correctly say that digital downloads are growing about 5 points a year, perhaps more in North America and U.K.? If yes, what was the base we were growing off of last year?"

Yes, we certainly are adjusting and evolving how we market our titles, and we think about this on a few different vectors. First is we see core purchase of the title continuing for much, much longer, particularly of high-quality experiences with great social play dynamics like properties like Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. And you should expect that we had planned for a longer marketing cycle around that. The second is we are using our network and investing more deeply in our network to drive cross-play of franchises within our network, and you should expect to see us continue to do that, using the games that we already have in the marketplace, to help introduce new players to new games that we know they'll love based on their play patterns. And then the third is the live services that are wrapped around games, active marketing in and of themselves. As every time we drive a new event around a particular property as part of a live service, that acts as a beat that drives conversation in social channels about the games that we play. So as we think about an elongated initial marketing cycle, as we think about the power of our network and the amount of players that we have in it playing every day and we think about the live services that we have wrapped, we are really transforming how we market our games and believe we're getting much, much stronger ROI on every dollar spent."

Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal '17, powered by a slate of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and player excitement for the new games we launched in Q2 and even more excited for the exceptional titles we have launched in Q3. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for FY '17.
More than 43 million players engaged in our breakthrough EA SPORTS games across consoles and mobile devices during Q2. On console, FIFA 17 has given soccer fans around the world a revolutionary new experience, powered by our Frostbite engine. We introduced The Journey, FIFA's first-ever story mode, which helped bring 20% more players into FIFA 17 in the first week of the last year's game. To date, nearly 2/3 of all FIFA 17 players, spanning 183 countries, have engaged in this critically acclaimed new addition to the game.
The FIFA Ultimate Team experience is more robust than ever in FIFA 17, and engagement continues to grow through new modes and global competitions. Players in the FUT Champions mode are now competing to advance to our live tournament event, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series.
Madden NFL 17 players spent more time in the game in Q2 than any previous Madden title in the last 5 years, logging 44 million gameplay hours during the quarter. Ultimate Team also continues to grow in Madden NFL, with engaged players in MUT up nearly 20% year-over-year in Q2. Our Madden NFL competitive gaming season also kicked off in Q2 with the Madden Classic, the first of 4 EA major live events in the Madden NFL Championship Series. 1.5 million fans played 5.8 million ranked games in the online qualifying rounds, and the top 16 players will compete for the Madden Classic Championship in Los Angeles in early December. The holidays are always a great season for football, and we're looking forward to more passion and engagement from our Madden NFL community in the months ahead.
EA SPORTS has been a leader in high-quality and emerging sports games across multiple platforms, and now we're delivering on that promise to mobile players as well. We now have top-performing mobile titles across 3 of our major sports franchises. Madden NFL Mobile continues to grow year-over-year in both unique players and sessions per day. NBA Live Mobile has brought in more players than Madden NFL Mobile did during its launch period. And FIFA Mobile hit #1 in the App Store Free Games chart in 138 countries just after its early Q3 launch. Each of these experiences are long-term live services that will continue to grow and be tuned with the expanding player base in this high-growth genre.
Strength in our mobile portfolio reaches across other key genres. Our action RPG, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, continues to drive strong levels of engagement, with average gameplay per player holding at 2.5 hours per day in Q2, one of the highest totals we've seen in a mobile game.
Our deep roster of live services on mobile, including The Sims FreePlay, SimCity BuildIt and Real Racing 3, continue to deliver long-lasting entertainment. Mobile players today expect increasing levels of creativity, depth and polish in the games they play. And as a result, only a few titles will break out.
With decades of rich experience building high-quality and immersive games, our portfolio of leading titles and a strong pipeline of new projects, we're well positioned for this evolution in mobile.
Throughout Q2, the energy around our 2 groundbreaking first-person shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, continued to build in anticipation of their Q3 launches. Battlefield 1 has impressed at every turn. From the debut trailer to subsequent looks at gameplay, features and single player stories, our Battlefield 1 content has over 100 million video views on YouTube, a record level for any EA game. Community influencers shared hundreds of hours of gameplay captured from PlayStations around the world, bringing the world of Battlefield 1 to life in unprecedented depth.
DICE has redefined the shooter genre with Battlefield 1, which now stands as the most highly rated Battlefield game of this generation. Player engagement since the launch on October 31 had been phenomenal. Battlefield 1's total player base for the first week was nearly double that of Battlefield 4.
Respawn has cemented Titanfall's position as one of the most exciting new IPs in the industry with the bold vision and accelerating action of Titanfall 2. This is a game that feels incredibly fluid and fulfilling to play. Critics agree that Titanfall 2 is a fantastic game, with more than 40 top outlets from around the world rating at 90 and above in reviews. The thrill of multiplayer in Titanfall 2 has the community buzzing, and rave reviews are also coming for the campaign that adds purpose and depth to the experience. Titanfall 2 has been called one of the year's must-play titles, and we're excited to see more fans across the world getting their hands on this extraordinary game.
Heading into the holiday season that will include updated consoles and more mobile devices, Electronic Arts is in an outstanding position. With Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we now have 2 of the top-rated shooter games of this console generation engaging a broad audience of players.
Our EA SPORTS titles are delivering excitement for fans with thrilling new gameplay, challenges in Ultimate Team and dozens of new competitive gaming tournaments from the community level to the global stage.
Our mobile portfolio has a game for every player with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes and more. And we will also deliver our first virtual reality experience this holiday with the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits on Daydream, Google's VR platform. We're looking forward to another strong quarter ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,404416344,1070490,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'",1764,"Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but we'll provide you with all the GAAP data you need to derive metrics comparable to our historical reported non-GAAP financials. 
In addition, to give more visibility into the performance of our business, we have decided to add a new operating performance metric: net sales. We define net sales as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Historical net sales have been added to our downloadable model posted on our website. 
In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with our historical non-GAAP results. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure to discuss the dynamics of our business.
We are very pleased with the strong second quarter, in particular, the great reception for FIFA 17 and the strength of our mobile portfolio. EA's GAAP net revenue was $898 million compared to $815 million last year. Net revenue was below our guidance by $17 million. However, the change in deferred net revenue was $40 million above our guidance at $200 million. If you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add GAAP revenue of $898 million to the change in deferred net revenue of $200 million. Thus, although underlying sales were above our expectations, because GAAP revenue is subject to the sales timing within the quarter, a larger portion of the total sales were deferred into future quarters. The increase over last year's net revenue was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 fiscal 2016 compared to smaller launches in Q3 fiscal 2015. See the document we posted on our Investor Relations website on July 19 for details on how to compare these results to historically reported non-GAAP results.
Our cost of revenue was $401 million, including acquisition-related expenses of $12 million and $1 million worth of stock-based compensation. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3%, up 5.5 percentage points over last year. This reflects the strength of Star Wars Battlefront 3 quarters ago in fiscal Q3 -- or fiscal 2016. As I just mentioned, revenue deferred from Star Wars Battlefront drove higher GAAP revenues in Q2 fiscal 2017 compared to the revenue deferrals from smaller titles launched in Q3 fiscal 2015. However, the cost of revenue this Q2 and last year's Q2 were approximately the same, given that their respective launch slates were similar. Thus, GAAP gross margin was up year-on-year. Operating expenses were $546 million, up $21 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by increased investments in R&D, particularly in new franchises and in our new Player Network infrastructure. The $20 million improvement on guidance was driven by timing of marketing activities. The $546 million includes $47 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses.
The resulting loss per share was $0.13, which is $0.04 better than our guidance due to lower costs. It is $0.32 better than last year. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $200 million change in deferred net revenue, $13 million in acquisition-related expenses, $48 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and the cost of revenue, and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that given our GAAP result was a loss, our share count was 301 million shares as GAAP requires us to exclude the estimated 13 million shares that might be issued in the future such as the shares expected to be issued this quarter for the settlement of the warrants. Those shares would be included in the diluted share count we -- had we reported a profit.
Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $109 million, up $100 million on last year. For the trailing 12 months, it was $1.1 billion. With capital expenditures of $120 million, free cash flow was $1 billion in the same period. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.
During Q2, we settled the remaining $136 million of our convertible notes. As a reminder, the warrants issued with our convertible notes are still outstanding and, starting on October 17, began to exercise automatically over 60 trading days. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway remains that our diluted share count already includes the potential dilution at the current share price.
During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $282 million in our 2-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.27 billion. 43% of this balance is held onshore. This is down from 48% last quarter, the difference driven primarily by the share repurchase and convertible notes settlement.
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion better than our expectations. Sales were driven by successful sports launches and growth in mobile. As discussed in our last call, FIFA 17 launched only 4 days from the end of the quarter. So almost no digital sales, whether downloads or Ultimate Team, were captured in the quarter. FIFA 16 launched 11 days before the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, allowing a whole week of digital sales to be captured. Using the first 4 weeks of sales to make a true like-for-like comparison shows that FIFA sell-through is up 13% year-on-year. And this speaks to how The Journey story mode has grown the market for our biggest franchise.
Digital net sales were $486 million, up $6 million on the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in mobile and in digital downloads, offset by the FIFA timing I just mentioned.
The long-term trend towards digital is clear in net sales for the last 12 months, which were $2.6 billion or 57% of the total. 
Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net sales in turn.
Extra content and freemium net sales were down nearly 12% year-on-year to $172 million, driven by the fact that almost all of the first week of FIFA digital sales will be captured in Q3 of this year. Using the first 4 weeks of Ultimate Team sales for FIFA 17 and FIFA 16 reveals year-on-year growth of 23%, even in the face of ongoing currency headwinds. 
Mobile net sales were $138 million in the quarter, up 22% year-on-year, with growth led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. We launched NBA Live Mobile in July and FIFA Mobile after the quarter-end, and early indications from both titles are promising.
Net sales for our full game PC and console downloads were $93 million, up 4.5% over last year and in line with our expectations. Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $83 million to net sales, flat year-on-year. Strong growth in EA Access and Origin Access were offset by decline in revenue from some older titles.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to $4.775 billion in net revenue and $150 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.387 billion, including $31 million of acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation.
Operating expenses are expected to be $2.304 billion, including $198 million in stock-based compensation and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. This results in an earnings per share of $2.69 for the year, also an increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $150 million change in deferred net revenue, $200 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and cost of revenue, $37 million in acquisition-related costs, $2 million in debt-related expenses, and a reduction of 1 million shares from the convertible bond hedge.
Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of $1.2 billion.
We expect Q3 fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow quarter ever. We anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. This reflects a modest increase in our expectations for the underlying business, primarily based on the early successes of FIFA 17. We're delighted with the way players are reacting to Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Both are reviewing very well, and we expect them to sell strongly for a long time. However, we're only a week into Battlefield and just a handful of days into Titanfall. So it's too early to update sales forecasts for either.
Guidance for the third quarter is for net revenue of $1.125 billion, including $910 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $532 million, including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses.
Operating expenses are expected to be $652 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.
Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year-on-year, chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises and our Player Network. This resulted to a diluted loss per share of $0.17 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derive measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $910 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $5 million in acquisition-related expenses.
We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $2.035 billion. This is up 13% year-on-year, driven by the combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. As you build models and make year-on-year comparisons, remember that the same timing issue that pushed FIFA digital sales into fiscal Q3 will also push some holiday sales into our fiscal Q4.
In conclusion, with the new innovations in FIFA, we have increased the market size. In Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we have 2 extremely high-quality games in place for the holiday season, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of successful mobile titles. Together, we expect them to deliver a record holiday quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew."

The audience for high-quality games on HD consoles and PC continues to expand. We believe the new console options will add depth to the hardware cycle, grow the installed base and add to the player value proposition.
The power of our Frostbite engine enables us to scale with platform capabilities to deliver the experiences our players want. From the groundbreaking gameplay in Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, to Mass Effect: Andromeda in stunning 4K, to extraordinary new VR experiences from our lab teams across the spectrum of high-end and lower-end devices, we are pushing our boundaries in a multi-platform world.
The evolution of mobile games is another growth vector, where the tenets of great mobile experiences and great HD games continue to converge and open new high-growth opportunities.
In this increasingly competitive world where the number of players and the number of games grows on a daily basis, players are looking to major brands as markets for quality. The expectations for creativity, innovation, polish and depth play directly to our strengths. Our EA SPORTS titles are strong demonstrations of social play blended with strategy and action that have proven to deeply engage mobile players over time. We will continue to infuse this same approach throughout our pipeline of new mobile experiences in development for the quarters ahead.
Players today also have more ways to connect and engage with the games they love. Millions of fans that can be competing in our global Madden NFL 17 and FIFA 17 competitions, beginning with in-game qualifications and leaderboards that will ultimately see championship events on a world stage.
In-game competitions have kicked off for Madden Bowl, our second EA major event for Madden. And season one of the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series is underway, which will culminate with the FIFA Interactive World Cup in August 2017.
Beyond competitive gaming, we're introducing new tools for our community to create content and share more of the amazing experiences they have in games like Battlefield 1. And building on the continued success of EA Access and Origin Access, we're exploring ways to provide subscription choices for more of our players.
In an ever-changing world defined by more content, more devices and an increasingly global player base, finding great games and connecting with friends becomes increasingly challenging. We are continuing to invest in our EA Player Network to reduce friction and improve discovery, purchase and enjoyment across all of our games and player touch points. The player experience as you enter Battlefield 1 is a good example of how this is beginning to roll out, with a new consistent interface that brings players into their personal Battlefield universe with the games they own, content recommendations and faster ways to squad up with their friends. The Player Network will grow and attract more players with these personalized services, in game and out of game, that add value and improve the experience with every minute of play.
We're energized to induce -- introduce our players to new experiences, new connections and new ways to play.

And then just second question. I know it's still very early days here, but just trying to get a sense of maybe how the digital download mix of Battlefield 1 is trending relative to Star Wars. I think you kind of gave the long-term guidance of a 5 point mix shift annually in terms of the digital download mix. Just curious how that's looking in the early stages so far."

We're just early in the holiday sales cycle. And while there's incredible excitement around both, we just don't want -- we don't want everyone to get ahead of themselves in the case of focusing on unit forecasts. But don't take that as a negative on either product. We're very excited about both of them and think there's a long opportunity not just in the quarter, but for a good 1 to 2 years to come. I remind people we had quite a few players still playing Battlefield 4 3 years after the game shipped right up until the time we shipped Battlefield 1. So deep engagement in that product. In terms of full game downloads, in the script, we talked about growth of 4.5% in Q2. And I remind everyone that none of the digital business for FIFA was in that number. And so you should assume that we're seeing healthy growth in full game downloads at or above our expectations. And you should assume that the early data on both Battlefield and Titanfall also is strong, mainly because the skew towards PC of those games versus, say, Battlefront was a year ago. So in general, we're very comfortable with the trend that we've put in place, and we continue to see consumers defaulting to what is the easiest way to buy products."

It's too early for us to be able to say that would mean more people are in the funnel or more people spending more. It's just early in the season to be able to say that. But we're very confident that people continue to enjoy the game mode and have found that to be a very highly engaging way to continue to come back and play FIFA every day or every week. And so we're optimistic about where that's going, but yet unable to know exactly what the stats are driving the underlying business."

And I think you could do lots of stats as to the size of the audience base for those 2 sports. I don't know those numbers off the top of my head, but clearly, global football is a lot larger than American football. The counter to that is that mobile games tend to monetize very well in the West and, in particular, monetize well in the U.S., and that's driven by economics in the country. That means that there are places around the world where we do not expect FIFA to monetize anywhere near at the level that it does -- what Madden does here in the U.S. I think for us, the long-term play is how do we build an engaging mechanic in mobile that provides access to the #1 sport in the world to allow people to engage like they do in Ultimate Team on console in places all around the world where they may not have access to a console or they may not be a console player. So that means large potential in all of Europe, both western and eastern; large potential in Latin America, where soccer is very strong; and obviously, a large potential in China. And our goal is to go after all of those markets with a very compelling service. The beauty of mobile as well, as Andrew just mentioned, is it can be tuned and change the engagement models over time without having to build a whole new product. You don't have, like in the console business, the need to build a product every year. You're constantly updating mobile, and that provides us the ability to tailor the offering as we find what plays well in each local market. On the Mass Effect question, really, our focus -- the way to think about it is our focus is on building great games. And right now, Mass Effect is tracking extremely well. The game looks beautiful, and we're really pleased with its progress. However, as you've seen, we are willing to make moves in launch dates if we feel it's necessary to deliver the right player experience. And our guidance assumes that Mass Effect continues to be in this year, but it gives us some flexibility that we might choose to move it either a week or 3 or 4 or 5 months, if we have to, based on what we want to make sure in terms of delivering the right experience for the player. So no news on Mass Effect other than we continue to have it in our guidance. And at the moment that changes, we'll certainly let everyone know."

On digital download data, again, what we have talked about many times is we see that growing by about 5 percentage points a year. That accounts for some more aggressive growth in certain markets over others. We do typically see markets in Europe where this is progressing more slowly, but again, I think by the time we get back to you next quarter, we'll have more data on both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 that we'll be able to share. And that will be a good measuring stick for us as we think about where digital downloads are going. But they're absolutely moving in the growth trajectory direction in all markets. But bigger markets like North America, U.K. and markets that typically have more access to digital payment methods are growing at a faster rate, as you might imagine. FIFA Mobile, as we think about that, we have built what we believe is a very, very strong EA SPORTS mobile organization. As many of you know, I've had the great fortune of leading that organization, the EA SPORTS organization for a number of years. And we take great pride in really driving great broad sport experiences on every platform that people want to access interactive sports on. We see it as a real opportunity for us to grow sports in the mobile space as we have done on almost every other platform up to this point. We also believe that the live-service orientation of sports is growing rapidly, as we have seen with Ultimate Team on our console business, and have built a very strong and robust organization around our sports mobile business that we believe is very well resourced to deal with the live-service opportunity that we think those games will bring on mobile."

It's proven early on in the success we've had with Madden, and we think we can do that. And I think it will prove ultimately that it will help us in the competitive sports world in how we design the tournaments that we're doing and how we partner with people during those tournaments.

Again, as we talked about coming into this, the first-person shooter category is a very large category, one of the largest.

We believe that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, while they have some overlap, fulfill very different motivations in what a player is looking for. And so we think there's really 3 types of players: people that really love Battlefield and that type of big strategic gameplay that will orient in that direction; the player that loves the fast, fluid, kinetic gameplay of Titanfall 2 and really orient in that direction; and the player that just has to play the 2 greatest shooters this year and will buy both. And again, we're very, very excited about the quality in both titles. We believe they both will have a long sales cycle both this quarter, through the festive season and deep into the years to come.

But in general, I think the core marketing focus, including traditional holiday promotions and all the activities around everything from Black Friday through the end of the calendar year, I think are pretty well baked in, reflected in our guidance. So I don't think you should see something different than that relative to our overall marketing spend. The -- in terms of R&D, we've talked I think publicly about roughly 25% of our R&D is for new products. Those new products could be brand-new IP such as we're building obviously a new studio in Montréal around Jade Raymond and the team she's building there, so we're hiring people for that studio. They'll be building a new action title for us. That's not next year or the following year. That will be 3 or 4 years out, but obviously, we're spending money on that. We're spending money on building out around key sports properties that we have, adding things like The Journey into FIFA, for example. You'll see more of that type of work on existing products over time, and we're obviously building out on the Star Wars franchise that has proven to be very successful for us. You'll see new Star Wars product coming out in the future as well. So much of our core increases in R&D expenses have been all around those new opportunities as well as some new technologies. So obviously, investing in VR, investing in streaming technologies, investing in mobile. We're trying to make sure we are very focused on where the future is going and be able to be there when any new platform's developed or any shifts in platforms happen. And we think it's a prudent way to run the business. We try to make our biggest franchises as cost efficient as possible, but at the same time, we're constantly investing in innovation around those to add new and exciting ways to play the games."

I guess, does it make sense to assume a Star Wars Battlefront title next year that could offset Battlefield 1 this year?

I'm not yet giving guidance for '18, so I want to be careful that we don't get overboard. But we're confident that we should be able to comp a strong year this year. One thing that people tend not to remember is when you have a title like a Battlefield or a Titanfall, those tend to sell extremely well in the catalog for at least another 12 to 24 months. And in the case of Battlefield, in particular, you have all the premium services kicking in next year. We won't see any of that in this year's revenue. So exciting times for our big franchises like that and huge opportunities for us to continue to monetize. We also believe our mobile business will continue to grow, which will obviously help in the comps year-over-year.

Yes, we certainly are adjusting and evolving how we market our titles, and we think about this on a few different vectors. First is we see core purchase of the title continuing for much, much longer, particularly of high-quality experiences with great social play dynamics like properties like Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. And you should expect that we had planned for a longer marketing cycle around that. The second is we are using our network and investing more deeply in our network to drive cross-play of franchises within our network, and you should expect to see us continue to do that, using the games that we already have in the marketplace, to help introduce new players to new games that we know they'll love based on their play patterns. And then the third is the live services that are wrapped around games, active marketing in and of themselves. As every time we drive a new event around a particular property as part of a live service, that acts as a beat that drives conversation in social channels about the games that we play. So as we think about an elongated initial marketing cycle, as we think about the power of our network and the amount of players that we have in it playing every day and we think about the live services that we have wrapped, we are really transforming how we market our games and believe we're getting much, much stronger ROI on every dollar spent."

I hope that someone, if they couldn't find it on the retail shelf, went home and digitally downloaded it. But I think, once again, with the new franchise, there's only been -- remember, there was only one Titanfall before, it was single platform. And so retailers often times, they have their own sales models. They try to build their own demand models and they listen to the consumer and they listen to our sales people, but at the same time, they're trying to balance how much they put on shelves. And they've got to spend money to build inventory and so you might have found retailers out of stock, and we hope that we've gone back and got those shelves filled up for the future."

What we have seen is that mobile is adding younger players at a higher rate than console is, but we're also seeing some mobile players come across. And I believe the number -- I believe about 70% or 75% of console players also play Madden mobile. And so what we're seeing is when you're a football fan and you're a Madden fan, you love the experience that is high definition on your 80-inch television, coupled with a live service like Madden Ultimate Team that connects you with your friends in that high-def experience, but you also love Madden and Madden games while you're on the go and you're using mobile as an opportunity to do that. As we look to the future, we think there is a world where we drive even greater connection at a design level between the console experience and the mobile experience. And we believe that is going to be a strategic opportunity for us as we think about the growing player base in any one of our franchises."

We are looking at a number of different things with them. As it's related to Titanfall 2, there are still a lot of things that they will be putting into the game for the foreseeable future. One of the lessons that we have learned is that when you have a great game like Titanfall 2 or Battlefield 1, giving it enough breathing room in the marketplace for fans to play for many years is really important to delivering the true value of that experience to fans, as we did with Battlefield 4. I think just a quarter ago, we announced we still had 11 million people playing Battlefield 4. And so expectation is that Respawn will continue to support and grow the Titanfall community through Titanfall 2. And over time, we'll work out what the right cadence for the next version of Titanfall is and/or any other titles they're working on. And then second..."
