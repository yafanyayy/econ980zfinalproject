2015 was a good year for Prudential. Our ROE exceeded 14% and in a challenging year, we met our financial objectives. Business fundamentals remain strong, with both our strategic positioning and execution supporting superior performance.
Fourth quarter earnings of $2.07 per share based on adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was adversely affected by higher expenses, which we had previewed on the third quarter call, and lower non-coupon investment income returns. As many of you know who follow Prudential are aware, our recent results have tended to be stronger in the first half of the year and weaker in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, earnings per share on the same basis of $9.86 was at the midpoint of the guidance we set out in our financial outlook call in December of '14, achieved despite less favorable market conditions than were assumed in the guidance. This translates to an ROE for 2015 of 14.2%, which was modestly exceeded the high end of our long-term ROE objective of 13% to 14%.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew nearly 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This strength reflects more consistently between our operating income and net income, one of our key priorities.
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our results, as well as our capital position in more detail.
I will touch on a few highlights.
To start, our international businesses had a solid year. And the fundamentals, in earnings power, these businesses are strong. On a constant currency basis year-over-year, earnings, excluding market-driven and discreet items improved modestly and constant dollar sales grew 8% at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Additionally, we are seeing positive trends in our distribution network. While the interest rate actions taken by the Bank of Japan are clearly a headwind, and we will react appropriately as we have done in Japan over many years, our Japanese businesses had historically generated ROEs in the 20% range and we expect them to continue to generate superior returns.
Earnings for our U.S. businesses, excluding market-driven and discreet items were down from 2014, though this was due to a more than $300 million swing in non-coupon investment income from the favorable results of the prior year. But underneath the headline numbers, we're seeing solid fundamental growth drivers in several businesses. Asset-management generated unaffiliated third-party net flows of $22 billion for the year, representing its 13th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. And Individual Life Insurance sales grew 31% across products while meeting our targeted product mix. Our retirement business continues to show leadership in the pension risk transfer market, with participation in all of the larger funded transactions completed in 2015. And full-service retirement had solid net flows for the year, with a meaningful large case win in the third quarter. And although the annuity business reported lower sales in 2015, we remained disciplined in our pricing and achieving our diversification priorities. 
We have also seen good underwriting margins across our domestic businesses, most notably, our retirement business had $80 million of positive case experience in pension risk transfer for the year and our Group Insurance business produced solid underwriting results, particularly in disability, which has benefited from its multiyear repricing efforts.
As we turn to 2016, the outlook is clearly more challenging as we highlighted on our financial outlook call. Market headwinds have only intensified in early 2016.
While these pressures are meaningful, we benefit from our unique mix of businesses that produce top-tier returns and diverse source of earnings and cash flow, as well as our very strong capital position. Our business mix, combined with a strong execution and an opportunistic approach to markets, has enabled us to grow adjusted operating earnings per share at a pace well above industry averages, above 12% annually, over the last 5 years. This has contributed to our ability to deploy increasing amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, amounting to about $9 billion since the beginning of 2011, or roughly 1/4 of our current book value.
Recall that we raised our dividend 21% in December and the board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion for 2016, which reflects an increasing level of capital generation in our businesses.
Additionally, one of our key strategic priorities as a company is to reduce the complexity and volatility in our business and increase transparency, issues that have distracted from our strong fundamental picture. 
At our financial outlook call, we announced the planned recapture of our living benefit writers from our valuable annuity captive in order to house all of the product risk together in our statutory entities. We expect this important step to further simplify our operations and reduce a significant source of volatility.  We will provide more details through 2016 as the transaction is finalized, but I'd like to provide an update on our recapture and also provide perspective on our Annuities business in the context of a broader retirement strategy.
We managed the Annuity business conservatively and we hold strong reserves in capital to support the economic product risks, a practice that we will continue subject -- subsequent to the recapture. And we price this into the product. Even with the decline in interest rates of equity markets in early 2016, we expect the planned recapture to increase and not detract from our capital flexibility. And we expected to reduce the overall volatility in our capital capacity. We generate good risk-adjusted returns at variable annuities, particularly as competitors have exited the market and the risk profile to product has improved. We are targeting and achieving mid-teen returns and expect the business to generate deployable capital consistent with the 60% of earnings we target for Prudential overall.
So as we sit today, we view variable annuities as a core product with solid return and cash flow prospects, and it's well managed in the context of a global platform of businesses that produce a diverse set of risks and sources of cash flow.
We also view the Annuity business as part of a broader retirement theme, which is a compelling long-term growth opportunity and one where we have invested heavily to build differentiated capabilities. We serve retail and institutional clients in multiple capacities, including through our defined contribution, staple value, pension risk transfer and annuity platforms, and we bring exceptional execution skills and asset management capabilities. We believe the growth and margin opportunity through this longer-term theme puts us in a position to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Now let me touch briefly on the regulatory environment before handing it over to Mark. We continue to participate with the Federal Reserve and the IAIS as they develop capital standards applicable to insurance entities. While we do not know what these standards will ultimately be, we continue to manage our business to very strong capital levels. And this gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to meet any reasonable standards without competitive disadvantages to our products.
It's also unclear what the Department of Labor will issue as a final fiduciary standards and we have participated actively with the industry groups in sharing our views of the unintended consequences of the draft regulations. But we also believe that our business mix and global platform puts us in a less exposed position than many of our peers.
Thus, as we think about 2016 and beyond, the combination of our differentiated business mix and strong capital position provides us confidence in our ability to produce solid results even as market conditions remain volatile and also to take advantage of opportunities that will likely emerge.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark."

And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.94 per share for the quarter compared to $2.12 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discreet items, EPS was down $0.26 from a year ago. While underlying performance across our businesses was solid, the decrease reflected a lower contribution from non-coupon investments and higher expenses in the current quarter. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $40 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago when the contribution was about $90 million above expectations. And the higher expense level included non-linear items, such as business development costs, benefit plan true ups and technology expenses. We estimate that these two items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
In thinking about our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses, for items such as technology and business developments, annual policy holder communications and on boarding and advertising and other variable costs, above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. Considering the higher expenses in the quarter relative to the full-year average and other variances from average expectations, including non-coupon returns, the impact on earnings this quarter would be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $735 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $1.2 billion net loss a year ago, which included a substantial negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate. 
Slide 3 shows financial highlights for the year. Earnings per share for the year amounted to $9.86 after adjusting for market-driven and discreet items, which implies an ROE of 14.2%. The full-year EPS comparison reflects lower non-coupon investment returns and less favorable currency exchange rates. Together, these items had a negative impact of roughly $0.75 per share on the comparison of results.
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items resulted in a net charge of $0.13 per share. These items included estimated remediation costs and corporate and other related to administration of separate accounts, also included a reserve true up in Individual Life related to conversion of a valuation system and also included our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business.
Moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $735 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $196 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to pretax losses of $141 million. Of note, the gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from rebalancing activities in our Japanese General account. We haven't seen signs of significant credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on the length of time with unrealized losses. Energy sector related realized losses were roughly $30 million in the quarter. Product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $534 million, largely due to the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits which decreased due to rising equities and interest rates in the quarter.
Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6, with Annuities. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I've already mentioned. Annuities earnings were $403 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Return on assets, or ROA, was 104 basis points for the quarter, roughly in line with the earlier quarters of the year and up from a year ago. The earnings increase in ROA improvement came mainly from lower interest expense, a 3% decline in policy charges and fees driven by the decline in average account values was essentially offset by lower base amortization and distribution costs.
Slide 7 presents our Annuity sales. You can see the impact of our product diversification strategy and the change in our sales mix. Notably, we have reinsured the living benefit guarantee related to our highest daily, or HD product, representing about 18% of gross sales for 2015. Recall that this contract started in April and extends through 2016. We've also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product and investment focused annuities. As a result, only about 40% of our sales for the year and about 1/3 for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefits guarantees.
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $168 million for the quarter, compared to $294 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $105 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income were about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $70 million above average expectations a year ago. Bond portfolio yields were also lower in the current quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from higher expenses, including business development costs. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses, the latter of which were about $15 million greater in the fourth quarter than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 9. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including $1.8 billion from 3 significant funded PRC cases, compared to sales of $8.5 billion a year ago, which included about $7 billion of significant funded and unfunded PRT cases. Full Service sales were roughly in line with the year ago. Total retirement account values amounted to $369 billion at year end, up by about $5 billion from a year earlier. Net flows were about $4 billion for the year, driven largely by our Full Service business. In our institutional standalone business, we more than offset our run off of funded PRT business, with just under $4 billion of significant new cases that closed during the year.
Turning to Slide 10. Asset-management earnings were $198 million for the quarter compared to $192 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset-management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, reflecting a gain of about $10 million from an asset disposition in the current quarter. Asset-management fees are up 3% year-over-year, tracking the increase in overall assets under management. Unaffiliated third-party AUM grew about $25 billion from a year ago, with $22 billion of net flows over the past year, including about $5 billion in the current quarter, mainly driven by new institutional fixed income mandates. The earnings benefit from continued growth of asset-management fees was more than offset by a lower contribution from the segment's other operations, which included an earn out gain of about $10 million a year ago and also included higher expenses, including to support growth initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $119 million for the quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. The net contribution from claims experience was modestly below our average expectations for the current quarter and about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. For the full year, our mortality experience was roughly in line with our average expectations. The current quarter contribution from investment results was also down from a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments, slightly below our average expectations. Considered together, these items had a negative impact of about $10 million on current quarter results. I would highlight that expenses in the quarter were about $20 million greater than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $49 million or 38% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal life sales contribution $30 million of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced to bring our rates more in line with the market. The remainder of the increase came mainly from our other Universal life products.
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $27 million for the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by a lower contribution from investment results, with non-coupon returns slightly below our average expectations and modestly less favorable underwriting results reflecting the impact of a smaller disability block driven by our repricing actions.
Slide 14 presents a timeline of our Group Insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. Our benefits ratio for 2015 is near the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years. As we've commented, benefits ratios can fluctuate from one quarter to another, but we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth with ongoing pricing and underwriting discipline.
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $367 million for the quarter compared to $382 million a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The higher levels of expenses in the current quarter reflected benefit planned costs, including an unfavorable true up and costs to update technology as part of an ongoing project. Mortality experience in the current quarter was about $10 million more favorable than average expectations, but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. The sequential quarter decline in earnings mainly reflects the concentration of expenses in the fourth quarter which are about $40 million above the quarterly average for the year, including items such as benefit plan and technology costs.
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings was $371 million for the quarter compared to $385 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $13 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The contribution to quarterly results from policy benefits experience included mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations, but mortality was about $10 million below the year-ago quarter, which benefited from higher surrender gains. The benefit of business growth was offset by a lower net contribution from investment results, including non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. Expenses in the fourth quarter were about $15 million above of the quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 17. International insurance sales on a constant dollar basis was $692 million for the current quarter, up $43 million or 7% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and other key markets and by Gibraltar's bank channel and life consultants. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count and mainly driven by greater term insurance sales. Life planners sales outside of Japan were up 10%, mainly from an increase in Brazil, where Life Planner count has grown about 20% from a year ago. Gibraltar sales were up by 5% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased 12%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product that is popular among high net worth clients of a key distributor that we recently cultivated.
Turning to Slide 18. The corporate and other loss was $378 million for the current quarter compared to a $326 million loss a year ago. Corporate expenses can fluctuate. The increased loss came mainly from higher expenses including items that are inherently variable, such as strategic initiatives and hedging costs that we retained in corporate and other.
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I will provide an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility. 
Starting on Slide 19. While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that [indiscernible] will report RBC well above our 400% target as of year end. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 900%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2015. 
Looking at our overall capital and liquidity position on Slide 20. A year ago, we estimated our available on balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion on a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt to arrive at a long-term targeted financial ratio of 25%. During the year, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases and over $1 billion of common stock dividends, including a fourth quarter dividend representing a 21% increase.  At the same time, we've increased our on balance sheet capital capacity to over $4 billion at year end and have brought our leverage ratios within our targets of 25% for financial leverage and 45% for total leverage. The increase in capital capacity in the standalone fourth quarter was mainly driven by capital generated from our businesses and a favorable impact from estimated statutory AAT reserves, net of about $600 million of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity, was about $1.7 billion at year end. As John mentioned, we remain on schedule to recapture our VA living benefit writer and manage the risks in our statutory entities. We continue to believe this action will not have a negative impact on our available on balance sheet capital capacity and expect it to contribute to our overall financial flexibility. As we noted, we will continue to manage the risks to AA standards and CTE 97 levels. We'll provide more details as the recapture occurs during 2016.
To address our current topic. Our direct and indirect exposure to the energy sector at year end was about 4% of our general account portfolio, excluding the Closed Block. Our energy exposure is mainly through public and private corporate fixed maturities of which roughly 90% our investment grade and net of unrealized losses of about $200 million.
Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $5 billion as of year end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repayment during operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

First, let me caveat that, obviously, can't update guidance or initially update our year end numbers. And actually, if you don't mind, what I'm going to do, I will take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up question, which is thinking about the same question in the context of what the impacts maybe to our earnings. And so let me get both of those in the same -- at the same time, if that's okay, and actually, I'll just start with the earnings because I think that's relatively straightforward. If you look at the performance of the fourth quarter, what we would note is that there have been no changes in the underlying business fundamentals from the point which we provided guidance. We knew when we communicated about the level and timing of expenses and we stated that we expected 2016 to be about 15% -- $0.15 over these levels. With regard to the sensitivity to the capital markets, specifically to the question you asked, I think we've given those -- the guidance on that out before, about 100 basis points, plus or minus, and interest rates is $0.20 a share and equity markets, plus or minus 10%, is about $0.30 a share, excluding our alternatives portfolio. On the capital piece, we actually don't provide similar rules of thumb for capital. And it's primarily because it's not linear and it's also subject to management actions. We actively obviously manage that capital position. But I have a couple of observations. First, if you look historically, the two largest drivers to our capital volatility in response to markets has been in our Annuities business and as a result of AAT updates. So let me turn to AAT first. If you pro forma the decline in interest rates since year end back on our calculation at the end of last year, it would not have a material impact on the year end calculation. And the reason for that is there are three components, the AAT calculation in addition to assumptions, three market components. It's underlying treasuries, but it also reflects but credit spread, so while treasuries have come down, credit spreads have expanded pretty dramatically. It's also the calculation is floored off the -- it's keyed off the five-year treasury and that has an impact as well. So turning from AAT to the Annuities business. As you know, we are in the process of recapturing the risks that we seeded out to our captive. There are a number of motivations or undertaking to do this, one of which is to reduce the volatility in capital and leverage that has been associated with market movements historically in that business and as a result of that captive. It's inappropriate for me to comment further, given that we're still in process, but I caution you to remember or encourage you to remember that it's our expectation that we will be substantially less sensitive to rate movements going forward in the Annuities business subsequent to the completion of that recapture. And actually, let me add one last thought. That is that while the market movements are certainly not welcome, they are not, by any means, unexpected or unanticipated. And what I mean by that is the degree of movement that we've seen so far this quarter is anticipated in our own cyclical stresses that we consider before we make decisions about how we're going to be deploying capital during the course of the year. We run those stress scenarios in order to ensure that we can execute on our plans in a phase of what we think of as modern or cyclical levels of market volatility and what we've seen to date would fit within that definition."

I will take that probably in two parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step b",1008,"Sure. I will take that probably in two parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step back and put the Japan business into perspective. So if you look at entire year within our Japan business, the end base products are slightly more than half of sales and foreign currency is slightly under half. In terms of the entire international operation, the yen-based products are about 45% of sales. Now it's also important to note out or point out that about 82% of what we do and what we sell is recurring pay product. And of the 18% that is single pay, 13% is fixed annuities, which we reprise every two weeks. So if you put all those numbers to the [indiscernible], you boil them down, you see that less than 5% of our international sales are single premium life or retirement products in Japan. And we monitor those really carefully. And to put that into perspective, what that 5% means, we sold less than $20 million of single premium life or retirement products in the fourth quarter. So the next point I'd like to make is we've been dealing with decreasing interest rate environment for a long time and maintaining the profitability. For example, we sell no single premium A&H products. We only sell recurring premium products so there's minimal spread risk associated with these. In addition, we stopped selling any single premium endowment products last year. Having said that, of course, there'll be some impact to low rates but it's a matter of degree. And the way we manage the risk is we continuously examine our product line up and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, which again, we've been doing for years as rates have been coming down. We also reduced commissions or discontinued sales of certain products that are more interest rate sensitive if they can't meet our profit [indiscernible] expectations. For example, Gibraltar Life stopped paying -- stopped selling its 6-year single premium endowment product in March of 2015 and in July, we continued -- discontinued selling the single premium whole life through bank channel. Gibraltar also discontinued selling its 10-year single premium endowment product, which again, means that all sales of the single premium endowment products in the Japan business have been discontinued. And we've also reduced crediting rates on certain products between POJ and Gibraltar. So we've taken and will continue to take action on all our product lines to maintain the appropriate level of profitability in the phase of the current interest rate environments or changes to interest valuation tables or mortality tables or other things. The other thing to remember is that within Japan, over 60% of our premiums enforce some new sales or from products where most of the profits come from, mortality, morbidity or expense margins. So inherently, we're less dependent upon spread, even when you think about recurring premium product or low interest rates for a long period of time. So in summary, there are three main reasons for our ability to maintain the profitability. One are the factors that -- other factors other than just price, which are important, i.e. our strategy to emphasize service to our customers, which gets the strength of our capital distribution, which is critical and the way they approach both their customers and the way that we approach third-party distribution. The second is the type of products we sell, most of which are recurring premium and much of which is less dependent upon spread, given the extraordinary emphasis we have on protection products. And the third is the discipline we have around profitability, i.e. repricing product, reducing commissions or eliminating unprofitable product. So that's the product side. The other part of your question really has to do with, I think, reinvestment, which is how do we -- how are we reinvesting the premiums and the rollover in this environment. So first, let me talk about rollovers and size then. In existing portfolio, our Japan portfolio's about $121 billion, of which about 45% of the portfolio is in JGB's. The portfolios have long durations, the LP portfolio's about 16 years and Gibraltar's about 10. So rollover's really light. And to put a number on that, rollover this year is less than $1 billion of yen denominated investments at the portfolio level. The second issue is how should we invest new premiums in rollovers given the recent lower rates. But first, recognize that a significant portion of the investment portfolio supporting the yen product is invested in long-term bonds that have been acquired over time and it yields higher than the current Japanese government bond yields. So we're starting out in a good place. But we have adjusted our investment strategies to changing market conditions and post the DOJ announcement on January 29, we did significantly reduce our purchase of JGB. However, strategically, our long-term investment philosophy, emphasizing discipline, asset and liability management, hasn't changed. And so for new investments, given the long duration in each of our liabilities, we are purchasing JGBs further out on the curve in the 20 to 40 year range. To the extent we're investing in the shorter end of the curve, i.e. 10 years or less, that's where we focus on non-yen investments hedge back to yen. So our investment strategy for yen products will be to continue to invest in longer-term JGB's and combining those purchases with a considerable allocation to more attractive yielding U.S. dollar assets hedge back the yen, including U.S. dollar private placements, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. This enables us to earn yields that are higher than those available from just having JGB's, thereby somewhat mitigating the impact of low interest rates at the short end of the curve. So hopefully, that addresses both the product and the investment side."

Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back i the business base evaluation because we know and anticipate that",1124,"This is John. Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back i the business base evaluation because we know and anticipate that there was likely to be questions about that. So let me give you a longform answer that hits that range I just talked about. Firstly, retirement in general, and the income phase in particular, is one of the largest macro trends in financial services for the next 20 years. And these macro forces not only bode well for financial services industry in general but they particularly are for insurance companies in particular. We're not interested in disinvesting in retirement. One of the reasons -- the reasons for the supposed strategic and financial. Strategically, we've intentionally positioned ourselves to be in the thick of the retirement macro, PRT, Annuities, DC, DB, stable valued asset management, and we've executed on the strategy, I think, exceptionally well, as reflected in our investment performance, our success in the marketplace and our fundamentals in terms of sales and flows. And the motivation is not simply strategic, it's also financial as well, as you were acknowledging. Our retirement business has make a major contribution to our growth rate, which has averaged over 12% per year the last 5 years or our ROE which has exceeded our 13% to 14% target for some time. Both of which are considerably better than our peers, as you were commenting. Turning more specifically to Annuities just for a moment. Helping clients accumulate retirement savings is something many financial players can do. Creating income streams for life is primarily the demand of insurance companies. So it's very easy to foresee a landscape shift in the relative importance of players that are purely asset gatherers, asset managers, to those who can also contribute to the lifetime income dimension and that's where Annuities can play a particularly important role. Particularly in broader and simpler applications that we think -- that we think are likely to evolve in the future. Now beyond the strategic relevance, the financial aspect of our Annuity business is a very positive as well. So we've talked about strong returns and a well-capitalized business, strong cash flows and those are not aspirational, that's a reality and 2015 is a good example. The challenge for us in this area has been historically the earnings and capital volatility and in the last two years, we've taken very significant measures to moderate that volatility, whether it's the reinsurance with Hamilton or the recapture of our Annuities captive and we expect these measures, as Rob was referencing, to substantially reduce the volatility going forward and to enhance our capital flexibility. So when you combine the reduction and the volatility with already attractive returns and cash flow, it makes the businesses -- the business all the more attractive. Now I want to go more to the -- broadly to the business mix. At one time, Prudential's business mix had the attributes of a financial supermarket, with healthcare, PNC, brokerage, investment banking and a whole lot of other things, and you could really challenge the wisdom of that, we certainly did. And so we went through the challenging and difficulties of dramatically changing this and changing the cost structure that supported it. And what we have today is very conscious, very deliberate. It's by design. It's not by default. And we're just focused on three things: retirement, protection; and asset management. Taken together and even more powerfully in combination. And that's what's enabled us to produce that earnings track record, the ROEs we've talked about and the $9 billion of capital that we've returned to our shareholders. For us, our challenge isn't delivering the results or the return in capital, it's getting it better reflected with what we believe should be a premium valuation. And the factors we think about when we think about valuation and what's influencing it, it really go into 3 buckets: the macro environment, including low rates and foreign currency fluctuations; the regulatory uncertainty; and the complexity and transparency challenges in our business. And I'll just touch briefly on each and I'll wrap. So in so far as the macro environment, we provided the sensitivity disclosures on each key area and we'll continue to provide more. But overall, our business mix and how we manage our operations mitigates the earnings impacts of any one macro driver. And further, our balance sheet strength is able to absorb substantial strain from low rates, equity markets and credit shocks and still maintain very competitive solvency ratios. On the regulatory requirements, we don't have an answer on future capital rules yet, but we are hopeful the picture will be clear over the next couple of years. We maintain a strong balance sheet, as we say. We have substantial capital resources, which we believe will be evident and adequate under any reasonable capital standards. And in the meantime, we've returned capital to shareholders in a very substantial and very disciplined way. And finally, a point of great emphasis, I think it's been underway for nearly two years, has been our focus on reducing the complexity and volatility in our business, which we believe has distracted from the underlying fundamentals and return attributes in our business. And these are very significant actions, including enhancing the visibility into our results through the raised the dividend and buyback authorization, which reflect the increased expectation of cash flow from over a year ago to 60% from 50%. The implementation of the divisional structure in Japan, to mitigate that the net income volatility from foreign currency remeasurement, the restructuring of the Closed Block business, which simplifies our operating structure and preparing to recapture the risks, which will eliminate substantial driver of the volatility and simplify our operations and we also take another steps, like reinsuring a portion of the living benefit writer on our newest highest daily DA business. And we will take more of this over time. Now those actions are -- sound technical to many but they're very meaningful. And over time, some are kicking in right away and others will kick in over time. And over time, they'll certainly reduce the noise in our results that distracted our broader story and create a much clearer line of sight between operating results, net income, book value growth and the like, and we believe will have a very positive effect on how we're viewed. So we're going at it with a real effort of looking at better alignment between our operating results, our financial results and our valuation and these are the steps we think are most appropriate for us."

It also includes assumption updates but if you look at where we are versus the end of last year, you have treasury rates that are a little higher and credit spreads have expanded as well, and those are both the positives for AAT release in addition to whatever assumptions that we bake in there. So it was a positive and significant contributor. On the second piece, on the portfolio, so if you look at our -- what we label as our non-coupon or alternatives portfolio, it's about -- it's a little under $8.5 billion portfolio. The biggest pieces of that would be in private equity. It's about 1/4 of it. Hedge funds figure, that's 15% or so, what's in there. And then real estate, which is about $1.5 billion of that number. The residual would actually be in public equities. I'm sure we have a fairly significant contribution in what we call as our non-coupon or our alternatives coming from public equities largely held in our international business. A big piece of that would be in REITs."

When you look at the retirement business, I'd speak to the following areas first of pressure on the trendline in earnings. First is, as you say, from non-coupon investments, that's experienced across several of our U.S. businesses but a lot of that impact is concentrated in the retirement business. Second is from lower reinvestment rates, in particular, in the Full Service business. And again, our pressure from lower reinvestment rates is something that works across the U.S. businesses but shows up to a large extent in Full Service. Third has been some degree of record-keeping fee compression. That's a trend we saw throughout 2015, although we do see it moderating in the latter part of the year. Now the levers that work the other way, the levers that we manage in the face of those pressures, again, we kind of really thinking about the Full Service business where a lot of this shows up. First, it's the overall size of the book. We've made significant investments in the business over the past couple of years. Those investments have really been around improving service levels and the client experience, the actual participant experience. Those investments have led directly to meaningfully increased sales in the past couple of years and higher persistency. Second is crediting rate management. We've done some of that in each of the past couple of years and we have the latitude to take that further as appropriate and necessary. Third is management of unit costs and a lot of our -- a lot of our work around cost efficiency is focused across the board in our businesses but in Full Service as well. For example, some of the references we made to higher expenses in the fourth quarter in the retirement business were actually efficiency charges that we took, charges that we took to prepare for taking steps that will drive further cost efficiency in that regard. And then finally, a focus on the total economics of a full-service case, including investment management opportunities in a given case. So that's really where we're -- how we're looking at the different types of pressures that show up in Full Service. Having said that, like I say, the impact from non-coupon and the impact from spread compression shows up to a large degree in that business. Other parts of the retirement business, such as pension risk transfer, for example, we had a very solid quarter and a very solid year and we look for further growth and further expansion of our results in those lines."

So we don't -- really don't undertake to play those sorts of games with our portfolio.

Remember that under GAAP, the valuation of our reserves have actually gone in a risk neutral construct and obviously, while we eliminate the margin piece of that, that's in the GAAP reserve, coming up with our hedge target, that, in effect, is not affected by the mix in the account values between equities and fixed income because there was a presumption that actually, the account [indiscernible] are going to grow at the swap rate effectively a little bit of a premium on the equity side. So while there's always some level of differentiation associated to that between the equities and the fixed income, it's not material and we would not expect as a result of changing of the portfolio and from the auto-rebalance to have a material outcome with regard to an unlock and/or an impact on our K factor."

We don't yet know the details of the planned rules but we are preparing for a full range of contingencies and degrees of potential impact on our businesses. A lot of our planning is focused on Annuities, retirement and Prudential advisors. In Annuities, to address your specific questions, we say that we're taking questions to prepare first for increased service requirement on our part in support of our distribution partners. And second, taking steps on the product front. Now in regard to compensation structures and product, I note that we already have had, for some time, fee-based options in place in a lot of our existing products. Those structures, those options have had limited uptake as of yet but as the regulation takes hold, we may see further migration towards those structures. More broadly though and looking forward, we're going to continue to evolve our product line and our product mix, we've already proven very successful in that sort of diversification over the past couple of years and we're going to continue to evolve that product line in mix to extend the franchise and address a larger portfolio of opportunities with, as John mentioned, streamlined and simpler solutions. If I could, I'd just touch on retirement and Prudential advisors as well because I think it's kind of important to give the perspective on how we're seeing the [indiscernible]. In retirement, we are -- we will be adapting the communications that we have that educate plan participants who are retiring or changing jobs on the options that they have for their retirement plan savings. In Pru advisors, there will be, on day one of the regulations effectiveness, there will be an immediate impact on our customer facing activities. For example, we will or already adapting our systems for the data collection and compliance that will be part of those customer facing activities and part of that systems move really entails accelerating the deployment of some technology platforms that we'd already long since planned. I will just frame out the point that Prudential advisors is a very important part of our retail distribution strategy. However, given the way we've reshaped our distribution platforms over the past decade or so, it, today, accounts for only about 20% of our retail life insurance, annuity and mutual fund sales. And so, as I say, I wanted to give you that flavor for the granular preparation we're taking for the regulation. We do see, coming back to your specific question, the potential for some disruption but we feel that we have the strength of distribution relationships and the skills around distribution support and around product design and development that will enable us to make those necessary adaptations."

So impact of market volatility on those levels would matter. But on the other hand, I think that the really expectation now of prolonged low interest rates would also, in and of itself, make up a plan sponsor think about transacting and in the sense that the plan sponsor isn't going to be able to inflate their way out of the issue at all, the rising interest rates and rising discount rates for the liability won't relieve the matter. I would say that when we think about the growth in the pipeline over the past couple of years growth in the industry and what we see in our pipeline, it's been driven and will continue to be driven much more by factors that don't really relate directly to capital markets. And those factors would be number one, increased awareness and sensitivity to longevity risk and desire to transfer. And number two, pretty much relentlessly increasing PBGC premiums.

2015 was a good year for Prudential. Our ROE exceeded 14%, and in a challenging year, we met our financial objectives. Business fundamentals remain strong, with both our strategic positioning and execution supporting superior performance.
Fourth quarter earnings of $2.07 per share based on adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was adversely affected by higher expenses which we had previewed on the third quarter call and lower non-coupon investment income returns. As many of you know, who follow Prudential, are aware, our recent results have tended to be stronger in the first half of the year and weaker in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, earnings per share on the same basis of $9.86 was at the midpoint of the guidance we set out in our financial outlook call in December of '14, achieved despite less favorable market conditions than were assumed in the guidance. This translates to an ROE for 2015 of 14.2%, which was modestly exceeded the high end of our long-term ROE objective of 13% to 14%.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew nearly 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This strength reflects more consistently between our operating income and net income, one of our key priorities.
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our results, as well as our capital position in more detail. I will touch on a few highlights.
To start, our international businesses had a solid year. And the fundamentals and earnings power of these businesses are strong. On a constant-currency basis, year-over-year earnings, excluding market-driven and discrete items grew modestly, and constant dollar sales grew 8% at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Additionally, we are seeing positive trends in our distribution network. 
While the interest rate actions taken by the Bank of Japan are clearly a headwind, and we will react appropriately as we have done in Japan over many years, our Japanese businesses had historically generated ROEs in the 20% range. And we expect them to continue to generate superior returns.
Earnings for our U.S. businesses, excluding market-driven and discrete items, were down from 2014, though this was due to more than a $300 million swing in non-coupon investment income from the favorable results of the prior year. 
But underneath the headline numbers, we're seeing solid fundamental growth drivers in several businesses. Asset management generated unaffiliated third-party net flows of $22 billion for the year, representing its 13th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. And Individual Life Insurance sales grew 31% across products while meeting our targeted product mix. Our Retirement business continues to show leadership in the pension risk transfer market, with participation in all of the larger funded transactions completed in 2015. And Full Service retirement had solid net flows for the year, with a meaningful large case win in the third quarter. And although the Annuity business reported lower sales in 2015, we remain disciplined in our pricing and are achieving our diversification priorities. 
We have also seen good underwriting margins across our domestic businesses. Most notably, our Retirement business had $80 million of positive case experience in pension risk transfer for the year. And our Group Insurance business produced solid underwriting results, particularly in disability, which has benefited from its multiyear repricing efforts.
As we turn to 2016, the outlook is clearly more challenging, as we highlighted on our financial outlook call. Market headwinds have only intensified in early 2016. While these pressures are meaningful, we benefit from our unique mix of businesses that produce top-tier returns and diverse sources of earnings and cash flow, as well as our very strong capital position. Our business mix, combined with a strong execution and an opportunistic approach to markets, has enabled us to grow adjusted operating earnings per share at a pace well above industry averages, about 12% annually, over the last 5 years. This has contributed to our ability to deploy increasing amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, amounting to about $9 billion since the beginning of 2011, or roughly 1/4 of our current book value.
Recall that we raised our dividend 21% in December, and the board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion for 2016, which reflects an increasing level of capital generation in our businesses.
Additionally, one of our key strategic priorities as a company is to reduce the complexity and volatility in our business and increase transparency, issues that have distracted from our strong fundamental picture. 
At our financial outlook call, we announced the planned recapture of our living benefit writers from our variable annuity captive in order to house all of the product risk together in our statutory entities. We expect this important step to further simplify our operations and reduce a significant source of volatility. 
We will provide more details through 2016 as the transaction is finalized, but I'd like to provide an update on our recapture and also provide perspective on our Annuities business in the context of a broader retirement strategy.
We manage the Annuity business conservatively, and we hold strong reserves and capital to support the economic product risks, a practice that we will continue subject -- or subsequent to the recapture. And we price this into the product. Even with the decline in interest rates and equity markets in early 2016, we expect the planned recapture to increase and not detract from our capital flexibility. And we expect it to reduce the overall volatility in our capital capacity. We generate good risk-adjusted returns at variable annuities, particularly as competitors have exited the market and the risk profile of the product has improved. We are targeting and achieving mid-teen returns and expect the business to generate deployable capital consistent with the 60% of earnings we target for Prudential overall.
So as we sit today, we view variable annuities as a core product with solid return and cash flow prospects, and it's well managed in the context of a global platform of businesses that produce a diverse set of risks and sources of cash flow.
We also view the Annuity business as part of a broader retirement theme, which is a compelling long-term growth opportunity and one where we have invested heavily to build differentiated capabilities. We serve retail and institutional clients in multiple capacities, including through our defined contribution, staple value, pension risk transfer and annuity platforms, and we bring exceptional execution skills and asset management capabilities. We believe the growth and margin opportunity through this longer-term theme puts us in a position to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Now let me touch briefly on the regulatory environment before handing it over to Mark. We continue to participate with the Federal Reserve and the IAIS as they develop capital standards applicable to insurance entities. While we do not know what these standards will ultimately be, we continue to manage our business to very strong capital levels. And this gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to meet any reasonable standards without competitive disadvantages to our products.
It's also unclear what the Department of Labor will issue as a final fiduciary standards. And we have participated actively with industry groups in sharing our views of the unintended consequences of the draft regulations, but we also believe that our business mix and global platform puts us in a less exposed position than many of our peers.
Thus, as we think about 2016 and beyond, the combination of our differentiated business mix and strong capital position provides us confidence in our ability to produce solid results even as market conditions remain volatile, and also to take advantage of opportunities that will likely emerge.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark."

Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our Year-end Earnings Call. 
I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. 
And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.94 per share for the quarter compared to $2.12 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.26 from a year ago. While underlying performance across our businesses was solid, the decrease reflected a lower contribution from non-coupon investments and higher expenses in the current quarter. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $40 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when the contribution was about $90 million above expectations. And the higher expense level included non-linear items, such as business development costs, benefit plan true-ups and technology expenses. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
In thinking about our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policyholder communications and onboarding and advertising and other variable costs above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. Considering the higher expenses in the quarter relative to the full year average and other variances from average expectations, including non-coupon returns, the impact on earnings this quarter would be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $735 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $1.2 billion net loss a year ago, which included a substantial negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate. 
Slide 3 shows financial highlights for the year. Earnings per share for the year amounted to $9.86 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 14.2%. The full year EPS comparison reflects lower non-coupon investment returns and less favorable currency exchange rates. Together, these items had a negative impact of roughly $0.75 per share on the comparison of results.
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items resulted in a net charge of $0.13 per share. These items included estimated remediation costs in corporate and other related to administration of separate accounts, also included a reserve true-up in Individual Life related to conversion of a valuation system and also included our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business.
Moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $735 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $196 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to pretax losses of $141 million. Of note, the gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from rebalancing activities in our Japanese general account. 
We haven't seen signs of significant credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on the length of time with unrealized losses. Energy sector related realized losses were roughly $30 million in the quarter. Product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $534 million, largely due to the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which decreased due to rising equities and interest rates in the quarter.
Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with Annuities. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I've already mentioned. Annuities earnings were $403 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Return on assets, or ROA, was 104 basis points for the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the earlier quarters of the year and up from a year ago. The earnings increase and ROA improvement came mainly from lower interest expense. A 3% decline in policy charges and fees driven by the decline in average account values was essentially offset by lower base amortization and distribution costs.
Slide 7 presents our Annuity sales. You can see the impact of our product diversification strategy and the change in our sales mix. Notably, we have reinsured the living benefit guarantee related to our highest daily, or HD product, representing about 18% of gross sales for 2015. Recall that this contract started in April and extends through 2016. We've also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product and investment focused annuities. As a result, only about 40% of our sales for the year and about 1/3 for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees.
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $168 million for the quarter compared to $294 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $105 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income were about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $70 million above average expectations a year ago. Bond portfolio yields were also lower in the current quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from higher expenses, including business development costs. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses, the latter of which were about $15 million greater in the fourth quarter than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including $1.8 billion from 3 significant funded PRT cases, compared to sales of $8.5 billion a year ago, which included about $7 billion of significant funded and unfunded PRT cases. Full Service sales were roughly in line with the year ago. Total Retirement account values amounted to $369 billion at year end, up by about $5 billion from a year earlier. Net flows were about $4 billion for the year, driven largely by our Full Service business. In our institutional standalone business, we more than offset our run off of funded PRT business with just under $4 billion of significant new cases that closed during the year.
Turning to Slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $198 million for the quarter compared to $192 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, reflecting a gain of about $10 million from an asset disposition in the current quarter. Asset management fees are up 3% year-over-year, tracking the increase in overall assets under management. Unaffiliated third-party AUM grew about $25 billion from a year ago, with $22 billion of net flows over the past year, including about $5 billion in the current quarter, mainly driven by new institutional fixed income mandates. The earnings benefit from continued growth of asset management fees was more than offset by a lower contribution from the segment's other operations, which included an earnout gain of about $10 million a year ago and also included higher expenses, including to support growth initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $119 million for the quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. The net contribution from claims experience was modestly below our average expectations for the current quarter and about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. For the full year, our mortality experience was roughly in line with our average expectations. The current quarter contribution from investment results was also down from a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments slightly below our average expectations. Considered together, these items had a negative impact of about $10 million on current quarter results. I would highlight that expenses in the quarter were about $20 million greater than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $49 million or 38% from a year ago. Guaranteed universal life sales contributed $30 million of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced to bring our rates more in line with the market. The remainder of the increase came mainly from our other universal life products.
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $27 million for the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by a lower contribution from investment results, with non-coupon returns slightly below our average expectations and modestly less favorable underwriting results, reflecting the impact of a smaller disability block driven by our repricing actions.
Slide 14 presents a timeline of our Group Insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. Our benefits ratio for 2015 is near the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years. As we've commented, benefits ratios can fluctuate from one quarter to another, but we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth with ongoing pricing and underwriting discipline.
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $367 million for the quarter compared to $382 million a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The higher levels of expenses in the current quarter reflected benefit plan costs, including an unfavorable true-up and costs to update technology as part of an ongoing project. 
Mortality experience in the current quarter was about $10 million more favorable than average expectations but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. The sequential quarter decline in earnings mainly reflects the concentration of expenses in the fourth quarter, which are about $40 million above the quarterly average for the year, including items such as benefit plan and technology costs.
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings was $371 million for the quarter compared to $385 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $13 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The contribution to quarterly results from policy benefits experience included mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations. But mortality was about $10 million below the year-ago quarter, which benefited from higher surrender gains. The benefit of business growth was offset by a lower net contribution from investment results, including non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. Expenses in the fourth quarter were about $15 million above of the quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 17. International insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis was $692 million for the current quarter, up $43 million or 7% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and other key markets and by Gibraltar's bank channel and life consultants. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count and mainly driven by greater term insurance sales. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up 10%, mainly from an increase in Brazil, where Life Planner count has grown about 20% from a year ago. Gibraltar sales were up by 5% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased 12%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product that is popular among high net worth clients of a key distributor that we recently cultivated.
Turning to Slide 18. The corporate and other loss was $378 million for the current quarter compared to a $326 million loss a year ago. Corporate expenses can fluctuate. The increased loss came mainly from higher expenses, including items that are inherently variable, such as strategic initiatives and hedging costs that we retain in corporate and other.
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I will provide an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility, starting on Slide 19. 
While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that PICA will report RBC well above our 400% target as of year end. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 900%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2015. 
Looking at our overall capital and liquidity position on Slide 20. A year ago, we estimated our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion on a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt to arrive at our long-term targeted financial ratio of 25%. 
During the year, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases and over $1 billion of common stock dividends, including a fourth quarter dividend representing a 21% increase.  At the same time, we've increased our on-balance-sheet capital capacity to over $4 billion at year end and have brought our leverage ratios within our targets of 25% for financial leverage and 45% for total leverage. 
The increase in capital capacity in the standalone fourth quarter was mainly driven by capital generated from our businesses and a favorable impact from estimated statutory AAT reserves, net of about $600 million of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. 
The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity, was about $1.7 billion at year end. As John mentioned, we remain on schedule to recapture our VA living benefit writer and manage the risks in our statutory entities. We continue to believe this action will not have a negative impact on our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity and expect it to contribute to our overall financial flexibility. As we noted, we will continue to manage the risks to AA standards and CTE 97 levels. We will provide more details as the recapture occurs during 2016.
To address our current topic. Our direct and indirect exposure to the energy sector at year end was about 4% of our general account portfolio, excluding the Closed Block. Our energy exposure is mainly through public and private corporate fixed maturities, of which roughly 90% are investment grade, and net of unrealized losses of about $200 million.
Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $5 billion as of year end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

First, let me caveat that, obviously, can't update guidance or initially update our year end numbers. And actually, if you don't mind, what I'm going to do, I'm going to take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up quest",628,"Ryan, it's Rob. Happy to do so. First, let me caveat that, obviously, can't update guidance or initially update our year end numbers. And actually, if you don't mind, what I'm going to do, I'm going to take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up question, which is thinking about the same question in the context of what the impacts may be to our earnings. So let me hit both of those in the same -- at the same time, if that's okay. And actually, I'll just start with the earnings because I think that's relatively straightforward. If you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, what we would note is that there have been no changes in the underlying business fundamentals from the point which we provided guidance. We knew and communicated about the level and timing of expenses, and we stated that we expected 2016 to be about 15% -- $0.15 over these levels. With regard to the sensitivity to the capital markets, specifically to the question you asked, I think we've given those -- the guidance on that out before, about 100 basis points, plus or minus, in interest rates is $0.20 a share. And equity markets, plus or minus 10% is about $0.30 a share, excluding our alternatives portfolio. On the capital piece, we actually don't provide similar rules of thumb for capital. And it's primarily because it's not linear and it's also subject to management actions. We actively, obviously, manage that capital position. But I have a couple of observations. First, if you look historically, the 2 largest drivers to our capital volatility in response to markets has been in our Annuities business and as a result of AAT updates. So let me turn to AAT first. If you pro forma-ed the decline in interest rates since year end back on our calculation at the end of last year, it would not have a material impact on the year-end calculation. And the reason for that is there are 3 components, the AAT calculation in addition to assumptions, 3 market components. It's underlying treasuries, but it also reflects but credit spread, so while treasuries have come down, credit spreads have expanded pretty dramatically. And it's also the calculation is floored off the -- I think it's keyed off the 5-year treasury, and that has an impact as well. So turning from AAT to the Annuities business. As you know, we are in the process of recapturing the risks that we ceded out to our captive. There are a number of motivations or undertaking to do this, one of which is to reduce the volatility in capital and leverage that has been associated with market movements historically in that business and as a result of that captive. It's inappropriate for me to comment further given that we're still in process, but I caution you to remember, or encourage you to remember, that it's our expectation that we will be substantially less sensitive to rate movements going forward in the Annuities business subsequent to the completion of that recapture. And actually, let me add one last thought, that is that while the market movements are certainly not welcome, they are not, by any means, unexpected or unanticipated. And what I mean by that is the degree of movement that we've seen so far this quarter is anticipated in our own cyclical stresses that we consider before we make decisions about how we're going to be deploying capital during the course of the year. We run those stress scenarios in order to ensure that we can execute on our plans in the face of what we think of as moderate or cyclical levels of market volatility. And what we've seen to date would fit within that definition."

I will take that probably in 2 parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step bac",1005,"Sure. I will take that probably in 2 parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step back and put the Japan business into perspective. So if you look at entire year within our Japan business, yen-based products are slightly more than half of sales and foreign currency is slightly under half. In terms of the entire international operation, the yen-based products are about 45% of sales. Now it's also important to note out or point out that about 82% of what we do and what we sell is recurring pay product. And of the 18% that is single pay, 13% is fixed annuities, which we reprice every 2 weeks. So if you put all those numbers through the Cuisinart and you boil them down, you see that less than 5% of our international sales are single premium life or retirement products in Japan. And we monitor those really carefully. And to put that into perspective, what that 5% means, we sold less than $20 million of single premium life or retirement products in the fourth quarter. So the next point I'd like to make is we've been dealing with decreasing interest rate environment for a long time and maintaining the profitability. For example, we sell no single premium A&H products. We only sell recurring premium products, so there's minimal spread risk associated with these. In addition, we stopped selling any single premium endowment products last year. Having said that, of course, there'll be some impact to low rates, but it's a matter of degree. And the way we manage the risk is we continuously examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, which again, we've been doing for years as rates have been coming down. We also reduce commissions or discontinue sales of certain products that are more interest rate sensitive if they can't meet our profit expectations. For example, Gibraltar Life stopped paying its -- stopped selling its 6-year single premium endowment product in March of 2015. And in July, we continued -- discontinued selling the single premium whole life through the bank channel. Gibraltar also discontinued selling its 10-year single premium endowment product, which again, means that all sales of single premium endowment products in the Japan business have been discontinued. And we've also reduced crediting rates on certain products within POJ and Gibraltar. So we've taken and will continue to take action on all our product lines to maintain the appropriate level of profitability in the face of the current interest rate environments or changes to interest valuation tables or mortality tables or other things. The other thing to remember is that within Japan, over 60% of our premiums in force on new sales are from products where most of the profits come from mortality, morbidity or expense margins. So inherently, we're less dependent upon spread, even when you think about recurring premium product or low interest rates for a long period of time. So in summary, there are 3 main reasons for our ability to maintain the profitability. One are the factors that -- other factors other than just price, which are important, i.e. our strategy to emphasize service to our customers, which gets to the strength of our captive distribution, which is critical, and the way they approach both their customers and the way that we approach third-party distribution. The second is the type of products we sell, most of which are recurring premium and much of which is less dependent upon spread, given the extraordinary emphasis we have on protection products. And the third is the discipline we have around profitability, i.e. repricing product, reducing commissions or eliminating unprofitable product. So that's the product side. The other part of your question really has to do with, I think, reinvestment, which is how do we -- how are we reinvesting the premiums and the rollover in this environment. So first, let me talk about rollovers and size that. In the existing portfolio, our Japan portfolio's about $121 billion, of which about 45% of the portfolio is in JGBs. The portfolios have long durations. The LP portfolio's about 16 years and Gibraltar's about 10, so rollover's really light. And to put a number on that, rollover this year is less than $1 billion of yen-denominated investments at the portfolio level. The second issue is how should we invest new premiums and rollovers given the recent lower rates. But first, recognize that a significant portion of the investment portfolio supporting yen product is invested in long-term bonds that have been acquired over time and it yields higher than the current Japanese government bond yields. So we're starting out in a good place. But we have adjusted our investment strategies to changing market conditions. And post the BOJ announcement on January 29, we did significantly reduce our purchase of JGB. However strategically, our long-term investment philosophy emphasizing disciplined asset and liability management hasn't changed. And so for new investments, given the long duration nature of our liabilities, we are purchasing JGBs further out on the curve, in the 20- to 40-year range. To the extent we're investing in the shorter end of the curve, i.e. 10 years or less, that's where we focus on non-yen investments hedged back to yen. So our investment strategy for yen products will be to continue to invest in longer-term JGBs and combining those purchases with a considerable allocation to more attractive yielding U.S. dollar assets hedged back the yen, including U.S. dollar private placements, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. This enables us to earn yields that are higher than those available from just having JGB's, thereby somewhat mitigating the impact of low interest rates at the short end of the curve. So hopefully, that addresses both the product and the investment side."

Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back into business mix and valuation because we kn",1125,"Erik, why don't I -- this is John. Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back into business mix and valuation because we know and anticipated there was likely to be questions about that. So let me give you a longform answer that hits that range I just talked about. Firstly, retirement in general, and the income phase in particular, is one of the largest macro trends in financial services for the next 20 years. And these macro forces not only bode well for financial services industry in general, but they particularly are for insurance companies in particular. We're not interested in disinvesting in retirement. One of the reasons for this are both strategic and financial. Strategically, we've intentionally positioned ourselves to be in the thick of the retirement macro, PRT, Annuities, DC, DB, stable valued asset management. And we've executed on this strategy, I think, exceptionally well, as reflected in our investment performance, our success in the marketplace and our fundamentals in terms of sales and flows. And the motivation is not simply strategic, it's also financial as well, as you were acknowledging. Our retirement businesses make a major contribution to our growth rate, which has averaged over 12% per year the last 5 years; or our ROE, which has exceeded our 13% to 14% target for some time. Both of which are considerably better than our peers, as you were commenting. Turning more specifically to Annuities just for a moment. Helping clients accumulate retirement savings is something many financial players can do. Creating income streams for life is primarily the domain of insurance companies. So it's very easy to foresee a landscape shift in the relative importance of players who are purely asset gatherers, asset managers, to those who can also contribute to the lifetime income dimension. And that's where Annuities can play a particularly important role, particularly in broader and simpler applications then we think -- that we think are likely to evolve in the future. Now beyond the strategic relevance, the financial aspect of our Annuity businesses are very positive as well. So we've talked about strong returns and a well-capitalized business, strong cash flows. And those are not aspirational, that's a reality, and 2015 is a good example. The challenge for us in this area has been, historically, the earnings and capital volatility. And in the last 2 years, we've taken very significant measures to moderate that volatility, whether it's the reinsurance with Hamilton or the recapture of our Annuities captive. And we expect these measures, as Rob was referencing, to substantially reduce the volatility going forward and to enhance our capital flexibility. So when you combine the reduction in the volatility with already attractive returns and cash flow, it makes the businesses -- the business all the more attractive. Now I want to comment more to the -- broadly to the business mix. At one time, Prudential's business mix had the attributes of a financial supermarket, with healthcare, P&C, brokerage, investment banking and a whole lot of other things. And you could really challenge the wisdom of that, and we certainly did. And so we went through the challenging and difficulties of dramatically changing this and changing the cost structure that supported it. And what we have today is very conscious, very deliberate. It's by design, it's not by default. And we're just focused on 3 things: Retirement, protection and asset management taken together and even more powerfully in combination. And that's what's enabled us to produce that earnings track record, the ROEs we've talked about and the $9 billion of capital that we've returned to our shareholders. For us, our challenge isn't delivering the results or the return on capital, it's getting it better reflected with what we believe should be a premium valuation. And the factors we think about when we think about valuation and what's influencing it really go into 3 buckets: The macro environment, including low rates and foreign currency fluctuations; the regulatory uncertainty; and then the complexity and transparency challenges in our business. And I'll just touch briefly on each and I'll wrap. So in so far as the macro environment, we provided the sensitivity disclosures on each key area, and we'll continue to provide more. But overall, our business mix and how we manage our operations mitigates the earnings impacts of any one macro driver. And further, our balance sheet strength is able to absorb substantial strain from low rates, equity markets and credit shocks and still maintain very competitive solvency ratios. On the regulatory requirements, we don't have an answer on future capital rules yet, but we are hopeful the picture will be clearer over the next couple of years. We maintain a strong balance sheet, as we say. We have substantial capital resources, which we believe will be evident and adequate under any reasonable capital standards. And in the meantime, we've returned capital to shareholders in a very substantial and very disciplined way. And finally, a point of great emphasis that has been underway for nearly 2 years has been our focus on reducing the complexity and volatility in our business, which we believe has distracted from the underlying fundamentals and return attributes in our business. And these are very significant actions, including enhancing the visibility into our results through the raised dividend and buyback authorization, which reflect the increased expectation of cash flow from over a year ago to 60% from 50%; the implementation of the divisional structure in Japan to mitigate the net income volatility from foreign currency remeasurement; the restructuring of the Closed Block business, which simplifies our operating structure; and preparing to recapture VA at-risks, which will eliminate a substantial driver of volatility and simplify our operations. And we also take in other steps, like reinsuring a portion of the living benefit writer on our newest highest daily VA business. And we will take more of those over time. Now those actions are -- sound technical to many, but they're very meaningful. And over time -- some are kicking in right away and others will kick in over time. But over time, they'll certainly reduce the noise in our results that have distracted our broader story and create a much clearer line of sight between operating results, net income, book value growth and the like, and we believe will have a very positive effect on how we're viewed. So we're going at it with a real effort of looking at better alignment between our operating results, our financial results and our valuation. And these are the steps we think are most appropriate for us."

But if you look at where we are versus the end of last year, you have treasury rates that are a little higher and credit spreads have expanded as well. And those have both the positives for AAT release in addition to whatever assumptions that we bake in there. So it was a positive and significant contributor. On the second piece, on the portfolio, so if you look at our -- what we label as our non-coupon or alternatives portfolio, it's about -- it's a little under $8.5 billion portfolio. The biggest pieces of that would be in private equity. It's about 1/4 of it. Hedge funds, figure that's 15% or so of what's in there. And then real estate, which is about $1.5 billion of that number. The residual would actually be in public equities. I'm sure we have a fairly significant contribution in what we call as our non-coupon or our alternatives coming from public equities largely held in our international business. A big piece of that would be in REITs."

When you look at the retirement business, I'd speak to the following areas, first, of pressure on the trend line in earnings. First is as you say, from non-coupon investments, that's experienced across several of our U.S. businesses, but a lot of that impact is concentrated in the Retirement business. Second is from lower reinvestment rates, in particular, in the Full Service business. And again, our pressure from lower reinvestment rates is something that works across the U.S. businesses but shows up, to a large extent, in Full Service. Third has been some degree of record-keeping fee compression. That's a trend we saw throughout 2015, although we do see it moderating in the latter part of the year. Now the levers that work the other way, the levers that we manage in the face of those pressures, again, in kind of really thinking about the Full Service business, where a lot of this shows up. First, it's the overall size of the book. We've made significant investments in the business over the past couple of years. Those investments have really been around improving service levels and the client experience, the actual participant experience. Those investments have led directly to meaningfully increased sales in the past couple of years and higher persistency. Second is crediting rate management. We've done some of that in each of the past couple of years, and we have the latitude to take that further as appropriate and necessary. Third is management of unit costs, and a lot of our work around cost efficiency is focused in -- across the board in our businesses but in Full Service as well. For example, some of the references we made to higher expenses in the fourth quarter in the Retirement business were actually efficiency charges that we took, charges that we took to prepare for taking steps that will drive further cost efficiency in that regard. And then finally, a focus on the total economics of the Full Service case, including investment management opportunities in a given case. So that's really where we're -- how we're looking at the different types of pressures that show up in Full Service. Having said that, like I say, the impact from non-coupon and the impact from spread compression shows up to a large degree in that business. Other parts of the Retirement business, such as pension risk transfer, for example, we had a very solid quarter and a very solid year, and we look for further growth and further expansion of our results in those lines."

The unrealized gain there must be significant at this point. And I'm wondering if you've given any thought to monetizing some of those unrealized gains? Reinvesting -- even after tax, reinvesting proceeds into U.S. dollar or other denominated securities hedging back to yen and taking the excess and buying your stock. I mean -- or more of your stock.

So we don't -- we really don't undertake to play those sorts of gains with our portfolio. And then third, I think as we think about stock buybacks, I think I've delivered this message before and it's consistent with how we think about it, which is that we are -- we think of ourselves as very good stewards of our capital capacity, stock buybacks are an important component of that stewardship. But we think about that in the context of delivering current returns back to our shareholders as a complement to our dividends as opposed to using it opportunistically to speculate on the valuation of our stock vis-a-vis what's fair value for that."

And we're going to continue to evolve that product line and mix to extend the franchise and address a larger portfolio of opportunities with, as John mentioned, streamlined and simpler solutions. If I could, I'd just touch on Retirement and Prudential advisors as well because I think it's important to kind of give the perspective on how we're seeing the reg. In Retirement, we are -- we will be adapting the communications that we have that educate plan participants who are retiring or changing jobs on the options that they have for their retirement plan savings. In Pru advisors, there will be, on day one of the regulation's effectiveness, there will be an immediate impact on our customer-facing activities. For example, we will -- are already adapting our systems for the data collection and compliance that will be part of those customer-facing activities. And part of that systems move really entails accelerating the deployment of some technology platforms that we'd already long since planned. I will just frame out the point that Prudential advisors is a very important part of our retail distribution strategy. However, given the way we've reshaped our distribution platforms over the past decade or so, it today accounts for only about 20% of our retail life insurance, annuity and mutual fund sales. And so as I say, I wanted to give you that flavor for the granular preparation we're taking for the regulation. We do see, coming back to your specific question, the potential for some disruption, but we feel that we have the strength of distribution relationships and the skills around distribution support and around product design and development that will enable us to make those necessary adaptations."

In terms of  market volatility and its impact on plan sponsor propensity to transact, I would say, certainly, funding levels have -- funding levels matter. So impact of market volatility on those levels would matter. But on the other hand, I think that the, really, expectation now of prolonged low interest rates would also, in and of itself, make a plan sponsor think about transacting. And in the sense that the plan sponsor isn't going to be able to inflate their way out of the issue at all, the rising interest rates and rising discount rates for the liability won't relieve the matter. I would say that when we think about the growth in the pipeline over the past couple of years growth in the industry and what we see in our pipeline, it's been driven and will continue to be driven much more by factors that don't really relate directly to capital markets. And those factors would be: Number one, increased awareness and sensitivity to longevity risk and desire to transfer it; and number two, pretty much relentlessly increasing PBGC premiums. That's what's been the driver over the past year or 2. And we would consider those factors to remain drivers in the future."

2015 was a good year for Prudential. Our ROE exceeded 14%, and in a challenging year, we met our financial objectives. Business fundamentals remain strong, with both our strategic positioning and execution supporting superior performance.
Fourth quarter earnings of $2.07 per share based on adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was adversely affected by higher expenses which we had previewed on the third quarter call and lower non-coupon investment income returns. As many of you know, who follow Prudential, are aware, our recent results have tended to be stronger in the first half of the year and weaker in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, earnings per share on the same basis of $9.86 was at the midpoint of the guidance we set out in our financial outlook call in December of '14, achieved despite less favorable market conditions than were assumed in the guidance. This translates to an ROE for 2015 of 14.2%, which was modestly exceeded the high end of our long-term ROE objective of 13% to 14%.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew nearly 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This strength reflects more consistently between our operating income and net income, one of our key priorities.
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our results, as well as our capital position in more detail. I will touch on a few highlights.
To start, our international businesses had a solid year. And the fundamentals and earnings power of these businesses are strong. On a constant-currency basis, year-over-year earnings, excluding market-driven and discrete items grew modestly, and constant dollar sales grew 8% at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Additionally, we are seeing positive trends in our distribution network. 
While the interest rate actions taken by the Bank of Japan are clearly a headwind, and we will react appropriately as we have done in Japan over many years, our Japanese businesses have historically generated ROEs in the 20% range. And we expect them to continue to generate superior returns.
Earnings for our U.S. businesses, excluding market-driven and discrete items, were down from 2014, though this was due to more than a $300 million swing in non-coupon investment income from the favorable results of the prior year. 
But underneath the headline numbers, we're seeing solid fundamental growth drivers in several businesses. Asset management generated unaffiliated third-party net flows of $22 billion for the year, representing its 13th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. And Individual Life Insurance sales grew 31% across products while meeting our targeted product mix. Our Retirement business continues to show leadership in the pension risk transfer market, with participation in all of the larger funded transactions completed in 2015. And Full Service retirement had solid net flows for the year, with a meaningful large case win in the third quarter. And although the Annuity business reported lower sales in 2015, we remain disciplined in our pricing and are achieving our diversification priorities. 
We have also seen good underwriting margins across our domestic businesses. Most notably, our Retirement business had $80 million of positive case experience in pension risk transfer for the year. And our Group Insurance business produced solid underwriting results, particularly in disability, which has benefited from its multiyear repricing efforts.
As we turn to 2016, the outlook is clearly more challenging, as we highlighted on our financial outlook call. Market headwinds have only intensified in early 2016. While these pressures are meaningful, we benefit from our unique mix of businesses that produce top-tier returns and diverse sources of earnings and cash flow, as well as our very strong capital position. Our business mix, combined with a strong execution and an opportunistic approach to markets, has enabled us to grow adjusted operating earnings per share at a pace well above industry averages, about 12% annually over the last 5 years. This has contributed to our ability to deploy increasing amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, amounting to about $9 billion since the beginning of 2011, or roughly 1/4 of our current book value.
Recall that we raised our dividend 21% in December, and the board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion for 2016, which reflects an increasing level of capital generation in our businesses.
Additionally, one of our key strategic priorities as a company is to reduce the complexity and volatility in our business and increase transparency, issues that have distracted from our strong fundamental picture. 
At our financial outlook call, we announced the planned recapture of our living benefit writers from our variable annuity captive in order to house all of the product risk together in our statutory entities. We expect this important step to further simplify our operations and reduce a significant source of volatility. 
We will provide more details through 2016 as the transaction is finalized, but I'd like to provide an update on our recapture and also provide perspective on our Annuities business in the context of a broader retirement strategy.
We manage the Annuity business conservatively, and we hold strong reserves and capital to support the economic product risks, a practice that we will continue subject -- or subsequent to the recapture. And we price this into the product. Even with the decline in interest rates and equity markets in early 2016, we expect the planned recapture to increase and not detract from our capital flexibility. And we expect it to reduce the overall volatility in our capital capacity. We generate good risk-adjusted returns at variable annuities, particularly as competitors have exited the market and the risk profile of the product has improved. We are targeting and achieving mid-teen returns and expect the business to generate deployable capital consistent with the 60% of earnings we target for Prudential overall.
So as we sit today, we view variable annuities as a core product with solid return and cash flow prospects, and it's well managed in the context of a global platform of businesses that produce a diverse set of risks and sources of cash flow.
We also view the Annuity business as part of a broader retirement theme, which is a compelling long-term growth opportunity and one where we have invested heavily to build differentiated capabilities. We serve retail and institutional clients in multiple capacities, including through our defined contribution, staple value, pension risk transfer and annuity platforms, and we bring exceptional execution skills and asset management capabilities. We believe the growth and margin opportunity through this longer-term theme puts us in a position to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Now let me touch briefly on the regulatory environment before handing it over to Mark. We continue to participate with the Federal Reserve and the IAIS as they develop capital standards applicable to insurance entities. While we do not know what these standards will ultimately be, we continue to manage our business to very strong capital levels. And this gives us confidence that we are well positioned to meet any reasonable standards without competitive disadvantages to our products.
It's also unclear what the Department of Labor will issue as the final fiduciary standards. And we have participated actively with industry groups in sharing our views of the unintended consequences of the draft regulations, but we also believe that our business mix and global platform puts us in a less exposed position than many of our peers.
Thus, as we think about 2016 and beyond, the combination of our differentiated business mix and strong capital position provides us confidence in our ability to produce solid results even as market conditions remain volatile, and also to take advantage of opportunities that will likely emerge.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark."

I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. 
And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.94 per share for the quarter compared to $2.12 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.26 from a year ago. While underlying performance across our businesses was solid, the decrease reflected a lower contribution from non-coupon investments and higher expenses in the current quarter. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $40 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when the contribution was about $90 million above expectations. And the higher expense level included non-linear items, such as business development costs, benefit plan true-ups and technology expenses. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
In thinking about our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policyholder communications and onboarding and advertising and other variable costs above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. Considering the higher expenses in the quarter relative to the full year average and other variances from average expectations, including non-coupon returns, the impact on earnings this quarter would be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $735 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $1.2 billion net loss a year ago, which included a substantial negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate. 
Slide 3 shows financial highlights for the year. Earnings per share for the year amounted to $9.86 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 14.2%. The full year EPS comparison reflects lower non-coupon investment returns and less favorable currency exchange rates. Together, these items had a negative impact of roughly $0.75 per share on the comparison of results.
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items resulted in a net charge of $0.13 per share. These items included estimated remediation costs in corporate and other related to administration of separate accounts, also included a reserve true-up in Individual Life related to conversion of a valuation system and also included our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business.
Moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $735 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $196 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to pretax losses of $141 million. Of note, the gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from rebalancing activities in our Japanese general account. 
We haven't seen signs of significant credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on the length of time with unrealized losses. Energy sector related realized losses were roughly $30 million in the quarter. Product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $534 million, largely due to the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which decreased due to rising equities and interest rates in the quarter.
Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with Annuities. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I've already mentioned. Annuities earnings were $403 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Return on assets, or ROA, was 104 basis points for the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the earlier quarters of the year and up from a year ago. The earnings increase and ROA improvement came mainly from lower interest expense. A 3% decline in policy charges and fees driven by the decline in average account values was essentially offset by lower base amortization and distribution costs.
Slide 7 presents our Annuity sales. You can see the impact of our product diversification strategy and the change in our sales mix. Notably, we have reinsured the living benefit guarantee related to our highest daily, or HD product, representing about 18% of gross sales for 2015. Recall that this contract started in April and extends through 2016. We've also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product and investment focused annuities. As a result, only about 40% of our sales for the year and about 1/3 for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees.
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $168 million for the quarter compared to $294 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $105 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income were about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $70 million above average expectations a year ago. Bond portfolio yields were also lower in the current quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from higher expenses, including business development costs. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses, the latter of which were about $15 million greater in the fourth quarter than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including $1.8 billion from 3 significant funded PRT cases, compared to sales of $8.5 billion a year ago, which included about $7 billion of significant funded and unfunded PRT cases. Full Service sales were roughly in line with the year ago. Total Retirement account values amounted to $369 billion at year-end, up by about $5 billion from a year earlier. Net flows were about $4 billion for the year, driven largely by our Full Service business. In our institutional standalone business, we more than offset our run off of funded PRT business with just under $4 billion of significant new cases that closed during the year.
Turning to Slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $198 million for the quarter compared to $192 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, reflecting a gain of about $10 million from an asset disposition in the current quarter. Asset management fees are up 3% year-over-year, tracking the increase in overall assets under management. Unaffiliated third-party AUM grew about $25 billion from a year ago, with $22 billion of net flows over the past year, including about $5 billion in the current quarter, mainly driven by new institutional fixed income mandates. The earnings benefit from continued growth of asset management fees was more than offset by a lower contribution from the segment's other operations, which included an earnout gain of about $10 million a year ago and also included higher expenses, including to support growth initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $119 million for the quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. The net contribution from claims experience was modestly below our average expectations for the current quarter and about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. For the full year, our mortality experience was roughly in line with our average expectations. The current quarter contribution from investment results was also down from a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments slightly below our average expectations. Considered together, these items had a negative impact of about $10 million on current quarter results. I would highlight that expenses in the quarter were about $20 million greater than our quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $49 million or 38% from a year ago. Guaranteed universal life sales contributed $30 million of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced to bring our rates more in line with the market. The remainder of the increase came mainly from our other universal life products.
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $27 million for the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by a lower contribution from investment results, with non-coupon returns slightly below our average expectations and modestly less favorable underwriting results, reflecting the impact of a smaller disability block driven by our repricing actions.
Slide 14 presents a timeline of our Group Insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. Our benefits ratio for 2015 is near the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years. As we've commented, benefits ratios can fluctuate from one quarter to another, but we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth with ongoing pricing and underwriting discipline.
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $367 million for the quarter compared to $382 million a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The higher levels of expenses in the current quarter reflected benefit plan costs, including an unfavorable true-up and costs to update technology as part of an ongoing project. 
Mortality experience in the current quarter was about $10 million more favorable than average expectations but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. The sequential quarter decline in earnings mainly reflects the concentration of expenses in the fourth quarter, which are about $40 million above the quarterly average for the year, including items such as benefit plan and technology costs.
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $371 million for the quarter compared to $385 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $13 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The contribution to quarterly results from policy benefits experience included mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations. But mortality was about $10 million below the year-ago quarter, which benefited from higher surrender gains. The benefit of business growth was offset by a lower net contribution from investment results, including non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. Expenses in the fourth quarter were about $15 million above of the quarterly average for the year.
Turning to Slide 17. International insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $692 million for the current quarter, up $43 million or 7% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and other key markets and by Gibraltar's bank channel and life consultants. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count and mainly driven by greater term insurance sales. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up 10%, mainly from an increase in Brazil, where Life Planner count has grown about 20% from a year ago. Gibraltar sales were up by 5% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased 12%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product that is popular among high net worth clients of a key distributor that we recently cultivated.
Turning to Slide 18. The corporate and other loss was $378 million for the current quarter compared to a $326 million loss a year ago. Corporate expenses can fluctuate. The increased loss came mainly from higher expenses, including items that are inherently variable, such as strategic initiatives and hedging costs that we retain in corporate and other.

I will provide an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility, starting on Slide 19. 
While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that PICA will report RBC well above our 400% target as of year-end. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 900%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2015. 
Looking at our overall capital and liquidity position on Slide 20. A year ago, we estimated our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion on a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt to arrive at our long-term targeted financial ratio of 25%. 
During the year, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases and over $1 billion of common stock dividends, including a fourth quarter dividend representing a 21% increase. At the same time, we've increased our on-balance-sheet capital capacity to over $4 billion at year-end and have brought our leverage ratios within our targets of 25% for financial leverage and 45% for total leverage. 
The increase in capital capacity in the standalone fourth quarter was mainly driven by capital generated from our businesses and a favorable impact from estimated statutory AAT reserves, net of about $600 million of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. 
The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity, was about $1.7 billion at year-end. As John mentioned, we remain on schedule to recapture our VA living benefit writer and manage the risks in our statutory entities. We continue to believe this action will not have a negative impact on our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity and expect it to contribute to our overall financial flexibility. As we noted, we will continue to manage the risks to AA standards and CTE 97 levels. We will provide more details as the recapture occurs during 2016.
To address a current topic. Our direct and indirect exposure to the energy sector at year-end was about 4% of our general account portfolio, excluding the Closed Block. Our energy exposure is mainly through public and private corporate fixed maturities, of which roughly 90% are investment grade, and net of unrealized losses of about $200 million.
Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $5 billion as of year-end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes.
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

First, let me caveat that, obviously, can't update guidance or initially update our year-end numbers. And actually, if you don't mind, what I'm going to do, I'm going to take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up question, which is thinking about the same question in the context of what the impacts may be to our earnings. So let me hit both of those in the same -- at the same time, if that's okay. And actually, I'll just start with the earnings because I think that's relatively straightforward. If you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, what we would note is that there have been no changes in the underlying business fundamentals from the point which we provided guidance. We knew and communicated about the level and timing of expenses, and we stated that we expected 2016 to be about 15% -- $0.15 over these levels. With regard to the sensitivity to the capital markets, specifically to the question you asked, I think we've given those -- the guidance on that out before, about 100 basis points, plus or minus, in interest rates is $0.20 a share. And equity markets, plus or minus 10% is about $0.30 a share, excluding our alternatives portfolio. On the capital piece, we actually don't provide similar rules of thumb for capital. And it's primarily because it's not linear and it's also subject to management actions. We actively, obviously, manage that capital position. But I have a couple of observations. First, if you look historically, the 2 largest drivers to our capital volatility in response to markets has been in our Annuities business and as a result of AAT updates. So let me turn to AAT first. If you pro forma-ed the decline in interest rates since year-end back on our calculation at the end of last year, it would not have a material impact on the year-end calculation. And the reason for that is there are 3 components, the AAT calculation in addition to assumptions, 3 market components. It's underlying treasuries, but it also reflects but credit spread, so while treasuries have come down credit spreads have expanded pretty dramatically. And it's also the calculation is floored off the -- I think it's keyed off the 5-year treasury, and that has an impact as well. So turning from AAT to the Annuities business. As you know, we are in the process of recapturing the risks that we ceded out to our captive. There are a number of motivations for undertaking to do this, one of which is to reduce the volatility in capital and leverage that has been associated with market movements historically in that business and as a result of that captive. It's inappropriate for me to comment further given that we're still in process, but I caution you to remember, or encourage you to remember, that it's our expectation that we will be substantially less sensitive to rate movements going forward in the Annuities business subsequent to the completion of that recapture. And actually, let me add one last thought, and that is that while the market movements are certainly not welcome, they are not, by any means, unexpected or unanticipated. And what I mean by that is the degree of movement that we've seen so far this quarter is anticipated in our own cyclical stresses that we consider before we make decisions about how we're going to be deploying capital during the course of the year. We run those stress scenarios in order to ensure that we can execute on our plans in the face of what we think of as moderate or cyclical levels of market volatility. And what we've seen to date would fit within that definition."

I will take that probably in 2 parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step bac",1007,"Sure. I will take that probably in 2 parts because there's a part that has to do with product and there's a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first in terms of sort of rates and repricing. But if I can, let me step back and put the Japan business into perspective. So if you look at the entire year within our Japan business, yen-based products are slightly more than half of sales and foreign currency is slightly under half. In terms of the entire international operation, the yen-based products are about 45% of sales. Now it's also important to note out or point out that about 82% of what we do and what we sell is recurring pay product. And of the 18% that is single pay, 13% is fixed annuities, which we reprice every 2 weeks. So if you put all those numbers through the Cuisinart and you boil them down, you see that less than 5% of our international sales are single premium life or retirement products in Japan. And we monitor those really carefully. And to put that into perspective, what that 5% means, we sold less than $20 million of single premium life or retirement products in the fourth quarter. So the next point I'd like to make is we've been dealing with decreasing interest rate environment for a long time and maintaining the profitability. For example, we sell no single premium A&H products. We only sell recurring premium products, so there's minimal spread risk associated with these. In addition, we stopped selling any single premium endowment products last year. Having said that, of course, there'll be some impact to low rates, but it's a matter of degree. And the way we manage the risk is we continuously examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, which again, we've been doing for years as rates have been coming down. We also reduce commissions or discontinue sales of certain products that are more interest rate sensitive if they can't meet our profit expectations. For example, Gibraltar Life stopped paying its -- stopped selling its 6-year single premium endowment product in March of 2015. And in July, we continued -- discontinued selling the single premium whole life through the bank channel. Gibraltar also discontinued selling its 10-year single premium endowment product, which again, means that all sales of single premium endowment products in the Japan business have been discontinued. And we've also reduced crediting rates on certain products within POJ and Gibraltar. So we've taken and will continue to take action on all our product lines to maintain the appropriate level of profitability in the face of the current interest rate environments or changes to interest valuation tables or mortality tables or other things. The other thing to remember is that within Japan, over 60% of our premiums in force and new sales are from products where most of the profits come from mortality, morbidity or expense margins. So inherently, we're less dependent upon spread, even when you think about recurring premium product or low interest rates for a long period of time. So in summary, there are 3 main reasons for our ability to maintain the profitability. One are the factors that -- other factors other than just price, which are important, i.e. our strategy to emphasize service to our customers, which gets to the strength of our captive distribution, which is critical, and the way they approach both their customers and the way that we approach third-party distribution. The second is the type of products we sell, most of which are recurring premium and much of which is less dependent upon spread, given the extraordinary emphasis we have on protection products. And the third is the discipline we have around profitability, i.e. repricing product, reducing commissions or eliminating unprofitable product. So that's the product side. The other part of your question really has to do with, I think, reinvestment, which is how do we -- how are we reinvesting the premiums and the rollover in this environment. So first, let me talk about rollovers and size that. In the existing portfolio, our Japan portfolio is about $121 billion, of which about 45% of the portfolio is in JGBs. The portfolios have long durations. The LP portfolio's about 16 years and Gibraltar's about 10, so rollover's relatively light. And to put a number on that, rollover this year is less than $1 billion of yen-denominated investments at the portfolio level. The second issue is how should we invest new premiums and rollovers given the recent lower rates. But first, recognize that a significant portion of the investment portfolio supporting yen product is invested in long-term bonds that have been acquired over time and it yields higher than the current Japanese government bond yields. So we're starting out in a good place. But we have adjusted our investment strategies to changing market conditions. And post the BOJ announcement on January 29, we did significantly reduce our purchase of JGB. However strategically, our long-term investment philosophy emphasizing disciplined asset and liability management hasn't changed. And so for new investments, given the long duration nature of our liabilities, we are purchasing JGBs further out on the curve, in the 20- to 40-year range. To the extent we're investing in the shorter end of the curve, i.e. 10 years or less, that's where we focus on non-yen investments hedged back to yen. So our investment strategy for yen products will be to continue to invest in longer-term JGBs and combining those purchases with a considerable allocation to more attractive yielding U.S. dollar assets hedged back to yen, including U.S. dollar private placements, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. This enables us to earn yields that are higher than those available from just having JGB's, thereby somewhat mitigating the impact of low interest rates at the short end of the curve. So hopefully that addresses both the product and the investment side."

Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back into business mix and valuation because we kn",1123,"Erik, why don't I -- this is John. Let me tell you how we're thinking about that and other related questions and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities, and then work it back into business mix and valuation because we know and anticipated there was likely to be questions about that. So let me give you a longform answer that hits that range I just talked about. Firstly, retirement in general, and the income phase in particular, is one of the largest macro trends in financial services for the next 20 years. And these macro forces not only bode well for financial services industry in general, but they particularly are for insurance companies in particular. We're not interested in disinvesting in retirement. One of the reasons for this are both strategic and financial. Strategically, we've intentionally positioned ourselves to be in the thick of the retirement macro, PRT, Annuities, DC, DB, stable valued asset management. And we've executed on this strategy, I think, exceptionally well, as reflected in our investment performance, our success in the marketplace and our fundamentals in terms of sales and flows. And the motivation is not simply strategic, it's also financial as well, as you were acknowledging. Our retirement businesses make a major contribution to our growth rate, which has averaged over 12% per year in the last 5 years; or our ROE, which has exceeded our 13% to 14% target for some time. Both of which are considerably better than our peers, as you were commenting. Turning more specifically to Annuities just for a moment. Helping clients accumulate retirement savings is something many financial players can do. Creating income streams for life is primarily the domain of insurance companies. So it's very easy to foresee a landscape shift in the relative importance of players who are purely asset gatherers, asset managers, to those who can also contribute to the lifetime income dimension. And that's where Annuities can play a particularly important role, particularly in broader and simpler applications then we think -- that we think are likely to evolve in the future. Now beyond the strategic relevance, the financial aspect of our Annuity businesses are very positive as well. So we've talked about strong returns and a well-capitalized business, strong cash flows. And those are not aspirational, that's a reality, and 2015 is a good example. The challenge for us in this area has been, historically, the earnings and capital volatility. And in the last 2 years, we've taken very significant measures to moderate that volatility, whether it's the reinsurance with Hamilton or the recapture of our Annuities captive. And we expect these measures, as Rob was referencing, to substantially reduce the volatility going forward and to enhance our capital flexibility. So when you combine the reduction in the volatility with already attractive returns and cash flow, it makes the businesses -- the business all the more attractive. Now I want to comment more to the -- broadly to the business mix. At one time, Prudential's business mix had the attributes of a financial supermarket, with healthcare, P&C, brokerage, investment banking and a whole lot of other things. And you could really challenge the wisdom of that, and we certainly did. And so we went through the challenging and difficulties of dramatically changing this and changing the cost structure that supported it. And what we have today is very conscious, very deliberate. It's by design, it's not by default. And we're just focused on 3 things: Retirement, protection and asset management taken together and even more powerfully in combination. And that's what's enabled us to produce that earnings track record, the ROEs we've talked about and the $9 billion of capital that we've returned to our shareholders. For us, our challenge isn't delivering the results or the return on capital, it's getting it better reflected with what we believe should be a premium valuation. And the factors we think about when we think about valuation and what's influencing it really go into 3 buckets: The macro environment, including low rates and foreign currency fluctuations; the regulatory uncertainty; and then the complexity and transparency challenges in our business. And I'll just touch briefly on each and I'll wrap. So insofar as the macro environment, we provided the sensitivity disclosures on each key area, and we'll continue to provide more. But overall, our business mix and how we manage our operations mitigates the earnings impacts of any one macro driver. And further, our balance sheet strength is able to absorb substantial strain from low rates, equity markets and credit shocks and still maintain very competitive solvency ratios. On the regulatory requirements, we don't have an answer on future capital rules yet, but we are hopeful the picture will be clearer over the next couple of years. We maintain a strong balance sheet, as we say. We have substantial capital resources, which we believe will be evident and adequate under any reasonable capital standards. And in the meantime, we've returned capital to shareholders in a very substantial and very disciplined way. And finally, a point of great emphasis that has been underway for nearly 2 years has been our focus on reducing the complexity and volatility in our business, which we believe has distracted from the underlying fundamentals and return attributes in our business. And these are very significant actions, including enhancing the visibility into our results through the raised dividend and buyback authorization, which reflect the increased expectation of cash flow from over a year ago to 60% from 50%; the implementation of the divisional structure in Japan to mitigate the net income volatility from foreign currency remeasurement; the restructuring of the Closed Block business, which simplifies our operating structure; and preparing to recapture VA at-risks, which will eliminate a substantial driver of volatility and simplify our operations. And we've also taken other steps, like reinsuring a portion of the living benefit rider on our newest highest daily VA business. And we will take more of those over time. Now those actions are -- sound technical to many, but they're very meaningful. And over time -- some are kicking in right away and others will kick in over time. But over time, they'll certainly reduce the noise in our results that have distracted our broader story and create a much clearer line of sight between operating results, net income, book value growth and the like, and we believe will have a very positive effect on how we're viewed. So we're going at it with a real effort of looking at better alignment between our operating results, our financial results and our valuation. And these are the steps we think are most appropriate for us."

I can't actually give you the AAT number because we have not yet filed our statutory numbers. Our statutory's blank, so I would be front-running our filing with our regulators. It -- I would note it was a significant contributor to our increased capacity. There are a lot of inputs there. They're not limited to just interest rates, it also includes assumption updates. But if you look at where we are versus the end of last year, you have treasury rates that are a little higher and credit spreads have expanded as well. And those have both the positives for AAT release in addition to whatever assumptions that we bake in there. So it was a positive and significant contributor. On the second piece, on the portfolio, so if you look at our -- what we label as our non-coupon or alternatives portfolio, it's about -- it's a little under $8.5 billion portfolio. The biggest pieces of that would be in private equity. It's about 1/4 of it. Hedge funds, figure that's 15% or so of what's in there. And then real estate, which is about $1.5 billion of that number. The residual would actually be in public equities. I'm sure we have a fairly significant contribution in what we call as our non-coupon or our alternatives coming from public equities, largely held in our international business. A big piece of that would be in REITs."

When you look at the retirement business, I'd speak to the following areas, first, of pressure on the trend line in earnings. First is as you say, from non-coupon investments, that's experienced across several of our U.S. businesses, but a lot of that impact is concentrated in the Retirement business. Second is from lower reinvestment rates, in particular, in the Full Service business. And again, our pressure from lower reinvestment rates is something that works across the U.S. businesses but shows up, to a large extent, in Full Service. Third has been some degree of record-keeping fee compression. That's a trend we saw throughout 2015, although we do see it moderating in the latter part of the year. Now the levers that work the other way, the levers that we manage in the face of those pressures, again, in kind of really thinking about the Full Service business, where a lot of this shows up. First, it's the overall size of the book. We've made significant investments in the business over the past couple of years. Those investments have really been around improving service levels and the client experience, the actual participant experience. Those investments have led directly to meaningfully increased sales in the past couple of years and higher persistency. Second is crediting rate management. We've done some of that in each of the past couple of years, and we have the latitude to take that further as appropriate and necessary. Third is management of unit costs, and a lot of our work around cost efficiency is focused in -- across the board in our businesses but in Full Service as well. For example, some of the references we made to higher expenses in the fourth quarter in the Retirement business were actually efficiency charges that we took, charges that we took to prepare for taking steps that will drive further cost efficiency in that regard. And then finally, a focus on the total economics of the Full Service case, including investment management opportunities in a given case. So that's really where we're -- how we're looking at the different types of pressures that show up in Full Service. Having said that, like I say, the impact from non-coupon and the impact from spread compression shows up to a large degree in that business. Other parts of the Retirement business, such as pension risk transfer, for example, we had a very solid quarter and a very solid year, and we look for further growth and further expansion of our results in those lines."

So we don't -- we really don't undertake to play those sorts of gains with our portfolio.

But we think about that in the context of delivering current returns back to our shareholders as a complement to our dividends as opposed to using it opportunistically to speculate on the valuation of our stock vis-a-vis what's fair value for that."

We've been conducting extensive planning for it, and we expect it to be released in late March, early April. We don't yet know the details of the final rules, but we are preparing for a full range of contingencies and degrees of potential impact on our businesses. A lot of our planning is focused on Annuities, Retirement and Prudential advisors. In Annuities, to address your specific question, Suneet, we've said that we're taking measures to prepare, first, for increased service requirements on our part in support of our distribution partners. And second, taking steps on the product front. Now in regard to compensation structures and product, I'd note that we already have had, for some time, fee-based options in place in a lot of our existing products. Those structures, those options have had limited uptake as of yet, but as the regulation takes hold, we may see further migration towards those structures. More broadly though and looking forward, we're going to continue to evolve our product line and our product mix. We've already proven very successful in that sort of diversification over the past couple of years. And we're going to continue to evolve that product line and mix to extend the franchise and address a larger portfolio of opportunities with, as John mentioned, streamlined and simpler solutions. If I could, I'd just touch on Retirement and Prudential advisors as well because I think it's important to kind of give the perspective on how we're seeing the reg. In Retirement, we are -- we will be adapting the communications that we have that educate plan participants who are retiring or changing jobs on the options that they have for their retirement plan savings. In Pru advisors, there will be, on day one of the regulation's effectiveness, there will be an immediate impact on our customer-facing activities. For example, we will -- are already adapting our systems for the data collection and compliance that will be part of those customer-facing activities. And part of that systems move really entails accelerating the deployment of some technology platforms that we'd already long since planned. I will just frame out the point that Prudential advisors is a very important part of our retail distribution strategy. However, given the way we've reshaped our distribution platforms over the past decade or so, it today accounts for only about 20% of our retail life insurance, annuity and mutual fund sales. And so as I say, I wanted to give you that flavor for the granular preparation we're taking for the regulation. We do see, coming back to your specific question, the potential for some disruption, but we feel that we have the strength of distribution relationships and the skills around distribution support and around product design and development that will enable us to make those necessary adaptations."

Some of them are consistent. The equity one that you mentioned, our assumption when we do our tail scenario was a 50% to 60% decline in equities, by way of example, to make it comparable. So there's not anything surprising in the way of the regulatory scenarios vis-a-vis the scenarios that we look at internally."

We have built a position of market leadership based on our capabilities, especially in the large case market.

In terms of market volatility and its impact on plan sponsor propensity to transact, I would say, certainly, funding levels have -- funding levels matter. So impact of market volatility on those levels would matter. But on the other hand, I think that the, really, expectation now of prolonged low interest rates would also, in and of itself, make a plan sponsor think about transacting. And in the sense that the plan sponsor isn't going to be able to inflate their way out of the issue at all, the rising interest rates and rising discount rates for the liability won't relieve the matter. I would say that when we think about the growth in the pipeline over the past couple of years’ growth in the industry and what we see in our pipeline, it's been driven and will continue to be driven much more by factors that don't really relate directly to capital markets. And those factors would be: Number one, increased awareness and sensitivity to longevity risk and desire to transfer it; and number two, pretty much relentlessly increasing PBGC premiums. That's what's been the driver over the past year or 2. And we would consider those factors to remain drivers in the future."

Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds, and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings",1062,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds, and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings per share of $2.26, which excludes market-driven and discrete items, is below the $2.65 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was a little over 12%, were modestly below the 13% to 14% that we target across the cycle. This, of course, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. At an overall level, we produced solid quarter results. However, the adverse impact of weaker non-coupon investment results, lower average equity markets and foreign currency headwinds drove the year-over-year decline from the particularly favorable results of a year ago. 
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and financial measures. I will provide some high-level observations in our businesses and discuss other matters affecting our operations. 
Our international business had a solid quarter despite the market challenges I mentioned. We continue to see strong underwriting margins and good core growth at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Interest rates in Japan are clearly a challenge, and we have made and will continue to make the necessary product and pricing changes to maintain strong returns. 
I would highlight that our overall constant dollar sales growth of 12% was driven by U.S. dollar products in Japan, where we have seen an increase in demand. 
We also completed the acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement administrator. We're excited about the prospects of this business as we expand our international footprint and expect habitat to produce steady growth and generate stable earnings and cash flows. It's taken a while to come to fruition, but we believe this investment and relationship is a very good fit for us. 
Our domestic businesses showed some mixed results, also largely reflecting market factors. At a high level, Individual Annuities continued to show solid margins, though sales levels have shown some pressure. And this reflects our pricing discipline as well as lower variable annuity sales industry-wide. 
Retirement earnings benefited from another quarter of solid case experience in our pension risk transfer business, which helped mitigate the impact of non-coupon investment returns coming in lower than our average expectation. Let me add that although we did not close any PRT deals in the quarter, we continue to see solid activity in the market. And as we've discussed in previous calls, the timing and distribution of the PRT transactions can be lumpy. 
Asset Management earnings were impacted by lower average equity assets under management and lighter earnings from other related revenues, particularly compared with recent trends. We also experienced weakness in third-party unaffiliated net flows, which showed net outflows of about $3 billion for the quarter. To put this in context, however, this follows very strong net flows in 2015 of $22 billion, and our pipeline for new mandates is robust. We remain optimistic on our asset management business and continue to invest in capabilities and distribution, but we're also not immune to some of the industry trends that have impacted active equity management strategies. 
Life Insurance earnings were impacted by adverse underwriting results as compared to our average expectations, which is not unusual for us to see in the first quarter. This quarter, we experienced both a greater than typical volume of claims as well as a higher level of claims with larger face value. Over time, we've had significant favorable mortality, including since we acquired Hartford's life business in 2013, which, by the way, has proven to be a very good fit. But mortality can vary on a quarterly basis. We continue to show solid sales results, which has benefited from product and distribution actions, while maintaining underwriting discipline. 
And finally, our Group Insurance business continues to show the benefits to earnings of our multiyear underwriting efforts. We also saw an increase in sales levels following several years of weakness as we benefited from several large case wins in the quarter. 
Let me also briefly address a few other topics of interest. In April, we recaptured the variable annuity living benefit riders that were managed in a captive insurer and now house all of our product risks together in our statutory insurance entities. This is the very important initiative that will meaningfully reduce the volatility in our business and increase transparency while not having adverse consequences on our capital flexibility. We will provide more details on this initiative with our second quarter results. 
The decision in favor of MetLife and their challenge to the FSOC designation is systemically important. It is a significant development with respect to group supervision and capital standards. We will determine an appropriate path for Prudential as this issue develops, considering other aspects of groups regulation as well. With respect to the FSOC designation, we have options as we go through our annual redesignation process. 
The fiduciary standard rule issued by the Department of Labor address some of the concerns expressed by the industry participants regarding the proposed rule and includes several positive changes. We continue to evaluate the new regulation and potential impacts on our business, which also needs to include consideration of how our distribution partners will respond. The final rule gives us a path forward to implement certain changes to our processes and businesses, including Individual Annuities, retirement, asset management and our in-house distribution arm, Prudential Advisers. And while there will be challenges with the new rule, we have a history of adapting to change and will continue to support our customers with innovative solutions to meet their retirement needs. 
In terms of capital deployment, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter and funded approximately $530 million for our Chilean investment, all while maintaining strong capital flexibility. 
So to sum it up, while this quarter's results were a little light than we would normally expect, due mainly to market factors, the fundamentals in our business remain sound, and we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet and capital position that enables us to return substantial amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.18 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.39 from a year ago. While underlying business performance was solid, the decrease reflected a less favorable macro environment and negative fluctuations in some inherently variable items. 
Non-coupon investment returns were about $90 million, below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago when we called out a contribution about $60 million above expectations. Earnings from asset-based fees in our U.S. businesses were about $50 million below the year-ago level, largely reflecting the 5% decline in equity market averages. And the contribution from other related revenues in our asset management business, which is largely driven by changes in market values and timing of transactions was $25 million below the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these 3 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Now moving on to Slide 3. Returns on non-coupon investments fluctuate over a cycle, by their nature. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, our long-term expected returns on these investments are 6% to 7%, with our expectation for 2016 slightly below the long-term average. In our case, included in non-coupon or alternative investments are private equities, hedge funds, real estate and a $3.6 billion public equity portfolio held mainly in Japan, which include stocks, mutual funds and JREITs These assets total about $8.8 billion as of March 31. While these investments diversify our exposure and are a good fit with some of our longer-term liabilities, especially in retirement, the pattern in returns introduces some variability into our results. We've called out significant variances from our average expectations, which provided a fairly strong tailwind in 2013 and 2014. However, returns are below the long-term expected average in the current quarter. We would estimate that current-quarter variances in comparison to our long-term average expectations from returns on non-coupon investments, mortality and Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience, together with the benefit of favorable revenues seasonality in our international Life Planner business, had a net negative impact on earnings per share of about $0.10. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $2.26 for the quarter implies an annualized ROE of 12%. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the current quarter. This compares to just over $2 billion a year ago, which included substantial mark-to-market gains from derivatives and hedging activities. 
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customers' accounts, which resulted in a net charge of $0.08 per share. 
Now moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $338 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income, amounting to net pretax gains of $44 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $282 million in the quarter, driven by the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance to variable annuity living benefits, which increased due to the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The gain from other risk management derivatives also came mainly from the decline in interest rates. Impairments and credit losses of $106 million included $85 million from the energy sector, primarily on bonds. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $381 million for the quarter, down by $42 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a similar decline in average account values, which was largely driven by equity market levels. Higher expenses and lower non-coupon investment returns, which were modestly below our average expectations, also contributed to the earnings decline and to the decrease in return on assets, or ROA, which has fluctuated in the low 100 basis point range. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Our sales mix continues to reflect our product diversification strategy, which we enhanced in April of last year with an agreement to reinsure about half of the living benefit guarantees on new business related to our highest daily or HD product. This agreement extends through this year. 
We've also grown sales on our fixed income-based PDI product with some recent small adjustments to enhance product attractiveness. As a result, only about 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefits guarantees. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $219 million for the quarter, down by $65 million from a year ago. The decrease included a $36 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $40 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $15 million above-average expectations a year ago. The decrease in non-coupon returns was partly offset by the impact of growth of the investment base over the past year. Contribution from case experience was about $20 million below the year-ago quarter, but roughly $20 million above our average quarterly expectation. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower fees in our Full Service business and higher expenses. The sequential quarter in earnings in retirement mainly reflects lower expenses compared to the elevated level of the fourth quarter and a greater contribution from case experience than in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.7 billion for the current quarter compared to $7.3 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion for the quarter, largely driven by stable value wrap products compared to sales of roughly $1 billion a year ago, which included about $660 million for a funded PRT case. Full Service sales were roughly in line with the year ago. Total retirement account value amounted to $372 billion at the end of the quarter, up by about $7 billion from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $5 billion from our Full Service business and about $2 billion from our institutional stand-alone business. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset management earnings were $165 million for the quarter compared to $205 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $25 million lower contribution from other related revenues, reflecting strong strategic investing results and incentive fees in the year-ago quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower asset management fees, driven by a 12% decline in average equity assets under management, which reflected both outflows and negative market impact. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets, with a 5% increase in average assets under management, partly offset the equity-driven decline. After $22 billion of net positive third-party flows in 2015, we experienced outflows of $3 billion in the current quarter, nearly all driven by equity strategies. As John indicated, we are seeing the impact of industry trends, including movement to passive strategies as well as some client rebalancing. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $120 million for the quarter compared to $125 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher expenses, including costs supporting business growth. The net contribution from claims experience was essentially unchanged from a year ago, but about $35 million below our average expectations. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect the lower contribution for mortality than the average for the year. The contribution for net investment results was essentially unchanged from a year ago. Lower returns on non-coupon investments, which were about $10 million below our average expectations, were offset by the benefits from a larger investment base. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were up $21 million or 17% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal life sales contributed about half of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced last year to bring our rates more in line with the market. We continually monitor expected returns and competitor action. And in February, we implemented modest price increases. The remainder of the increase in sales came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Moving now to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $26 million for the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. A lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations, together with higher expenses, more than offset more favorable underwriting results driven by Group Life. The current quarter total benefits ratio was more favorable than a year ago and within our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Turning to Slide 14. Group Insurance sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were $311 million for the quarter, nearly double the level of the year ago. More sales occur in the first quarter based on calendar year inception. Following the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years, we did see an increase in sales of both Group Life and Group Disability, including more larger cases. 
Moving now to International Insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings of our Life Planner business were $410 million for the quarter compared to $439 million a year ago. Excluding a $30 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by less favorable mortality experience, higher expenses, including nonlinear items such as legal and business development costs and a lower contribution from investment results, including non-coupon investment returns, about $5 million below our average expectations. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially consistent with our average expectations but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $30 million in relation to our quarterly average. 
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $369 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding the negative impact of $28 million on the comparison of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Looking at some key components, the benefits to earnings from business growth, including the initial contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, were offset by a lower contribution from investment results of about $40 million. Business growth drove an increase in earnings of about $20 million, with about half from Chile, including above-average returns on the coinvestment in the managed funds, otherwise known as the [indiscernible] The contribution to earnings from mortality experience, which was about $5 million more favorable than our average expectations, exceeded the year-ago quarter by about $15 million. Net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments, about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter compared to about $40 million above expectations a year ago. This $60 million variance was partly offset by benefits to spread results, including higher prepayment income and growth in the base of invested assets. 
Turning to Slide 17. International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $781 million for the current quarter, up by $86 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and by Gibraltar's bank channel and Life Consultant. About 45% of our current-quarter sales in Japan were U.S.-dollar products compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. 
Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were also up by 15% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased by 27%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S.-dollar retirement income product and by Death Protection products. Life Consultant sales increased by 10%, benefiting from a recently introduced U.S. dollar whole life product that has been popular among client seeking maximum death protection in early contract years. 
Turning to Slide 18. The Corporate and Other loss was $312 million for the current quarter compared to $253 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a benefit in the year-ago quarter from returns on assets from our Closed Block restructuring that were subsequently deployed in our businesses; and higher expenses, including items such as legal costs, which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to give an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 19. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484% with total adjusted capital or CAC of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio, as of the end of the first quarter, is well above our 400% target. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solid margins of 877% and 929%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, December 31, 2015. We expect these ratios to be above our targets as of their fiscal year-end on March 31. 
Looking at liquidity. Leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 20. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $1 billion from year-end was driven primarily by our shareholder distributions, debt reduction and acquisition funding. The excess over our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of March 31 remained within our targets. 
During the first quarter, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders, including $375 million of share repurchases under the $1.5 billion authorization for the year. And in March, we funded the purchase of our stake in AFP Habitat in Chile with a purchase price of about $530 million. As John noted, we maintained our capital capacity at a level not meaningfully different than what we reported at year-end. 
Let me provide an update on a few other noteworthy items. The fair value of our yen equity hedge was about $760 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.7 billion at year-end. The decline in fair value is, as expected, in response to the 7% strengthening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar during the quarter and corresponds to an increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent of yen earnings in Japan over time. Expected cash flows from the yen hedge in 2016 reflects scheduled settlements that are essentially unaffected by the change in fair value. Though the fair value of our equity hedge declined sequentially, they continue to operate as designed to protect the value of our businesses and the overall return profile against currency moves in our largest overseas operation. 
On our energy holdings. Our net unrealized loss on the energy sector fixed maturities, excluding the Closed Block, at the end of the quarter was about $200 million, essentially unchanged from year-end. 83% of fixed maturities were investment-grade. 
To update you on variable annuity recapture. On April 1, we recaptured the living benefits risks from our captive insurer, moving the rider risks into our statutory insurance companies to be managed together with the base contracts. This marks a major milestone in our initiative, which is on track for completion over the course of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

One, as you said, rates are much lower in Japan. So on a relative basis, they're better in the U.S. But also the appreciation of the yen has led people to think, ""Gosh, with yen, I can buy more dollars. And therefore, U.S. dollar products are more attractive."" And with a wide range of suite -- this suite of wide range of products that we have in the U.S., I think our product offering is quite attractive.

So as we've mentioned in the past, our business generate a significant amount of capital, and there was no change from that in the first quarter. And I think we've provided sort of rules of thumb that are helpful around that, and that's the fact that about 60% of our operating earnings translate into free cash flow. You think about that well, if there's any given quarter, you think about that as being a capital-generating capacity in the form of free cash flow. And as I said, that's sort of representative of what we see longer term but also in the first quarter. The -- there were significant capital deployment actions during the course of the quarter, so as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we had about $0.7 billion of shareholder distributions. That was in the form of both share repurchases. And that's at an elevated level. Recall that we increased our buyback program by about $0.5 billion at the end of last year. For this year, we increase it from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And it was also in dividends. And recall that we also increased that dividend rate by an excess of 20% last year. So those with the distributions, we funded about $0.5 billion from our Chilean acquisition. Now that we had already earmarked from our capital capacity that we articulated at the end of the year because it was an imminent transaction. So when you think about apples to apples, the Chilean acquisition was already taken out of the capacity number. So the remaining variable the fact that we reduced our debt by about $0.25 billion. It was maturing, and we paid that off. And about sort of going from year-end to the end of this quarter, that you generated internal capital capacity that was sufficient to fund our shareholder distributions, the M&A activity and strategic investments were taken care of in our prior allocation of capital, and you have left the debt reduction, which would be sort of a -- maybe placeholder for the order of magnitude of change in our total capital capacity from year-end to where we are now."

We've been able to take those proceeds and redeploy them either in the form of share repurchases or in the form of investments in order to restore the ROE that otherwise would have been lost by virtue of the depreciation of the yen. To your point, as the yen appreciates, you get things that could go the other direction. So hedge settlements would go instead of from the Japanese companies to the holding company. They would go the other way. However, the point is that ROE is protected in either direction. And we've actually experienced this in the past. The higher yen earnings contribute to sustaining our targeted enterprise ROE because what happens is, over time, our yen earnings are higher. It creates greater dividend capacity, and that translates ultimately to greater U.S. dollar dividends coming back to us. We actually think about that yen hedge, it creates capital capacity when there's a depreciating yen. when there's an appreciating yen, what happens is when something what we consider to be more liquidity issue, which is temporarily have to fund the mark on those going down to the Japanese companies, but that ultimately works its way back to us in the form of the higher earnings and greater dividends coming back to the holding company."

It just strikes me as curious, and I guess this is more of the question of a cultural rather than a financial nature, but what is it about Japan and Japanese nationals that lead to the interest in these products, exposing the customers to FX risk? I presume that in the typical transaction, the customer is not hedging, the customers foreign exchange rate is exposed therefore the possibility that down the road, either when the customer retires or the customer dies, the family will receive less money than the customer thought because of weakening of the yen, the customers' family receive the customer and retirement receives dollar investment. What's your sense of why these -- why the customers are willing to take this FX risk -- I guess, I'll wrap up the question by saying I can't imagine if we sold yen-denominated life insurance in the United States. It would be nearly as successful as your life insurance -- a dollar-denominated products there?"

I think the issue with Japanese consumers is one of having lived with a low interest rate environment for a long, long period of time and looking at the interest rate differential with the U.S. And yes, you are right. They do take the FX risks. But over time, there -- what they believe, and what they experienced, frankly, has been, is that the FX risk is not as great as the interest rate differential. And therefore, and they're willing to do that. You've seen it with the U.S. dollar product, and you've seen it with the Aussie dollar product. And they're very savvy because they'll go back and forth from time to time. Now most of the product we sell, as Mark suggested, is life insurance-based, it's protection-based. So they buy it for different reasons. It's not savings products per se. But they do look at the interest rate differential and then make decisions accordingly. And they have for a long period of time because they've been living in an environment where those differentials in interest rates between Japan and then the U.S. and Australia had been there for a long period of time."

It's a kind of a 2-part question. One, do you think that the distributor rather than manufacturer would be the one who is a party to the legal risk of the best-interest contract? And if that is the case, can you characterize your conversations with your distribution thus far and kind of how constructive they are so far on being able to sell VAs under the BIC?"

I'm not going to get into an apportionment of legal liability. I'm sure you understand that, but I would say that -- I would point out that manufacturers will have a responsibility to perform certain processes and provide certain information to distributors so that they can fulfill their obligations under the contract. And we are making the necessary preparations to do exactly that. I think, if I could, just to address some other questions that I know have come up on other calls regarding the DOL, just to make some broader comments. The final rule does contain some meaningful improvements. We still think it creates significant challenges and changes in the industry as a whole. It can increase compliance costs, although I would say that that's not an overly consequential matter for our company of our size, and it can also contain, as you were pointing out, increased exposure to legal claims. As such, we think it's more important than ever to really avoid those unintended consequences that we spoke about last summer on Investor Day and ensure continued access to education, advice and product solutions. That's the position we've taken consistently, and we'll continue to do so. If you look at our 3 businesses most impacted on Prudential Advisees, and here I'm a talking about differences between the original regulation and the final one, if you look at Prudential Advisers, the final rule did make the process for obtaining the required contract under the BIC exception, less onerous than it originally was. And also permits us to deal with, on a negative consent basis, with clients who had accounts established prior to the beginning of 2018. So that's helpful. Final rule also clarified how proprietary products can be sold to owners, providing we address of significant requirements. Again, that's useful. So for Prudential advisors, compliance and business processes change, and we'll be ready for those changes, and we fully expect that unit to continue to play an important role in our distribution strategy. For annuities, you touched upon this in your question, Randy. The DOL did attempt to clarify the circumstances under which higher compensation for the sale of more complex products continue -- requiring more upfront time by the adviser is permissible, so long as the compensation is reasonable and what that means we'll be -- we'll play out over time. The final rule did not include an exception that would have favored lower-cost products such as index funds over higher-cost, higher-value products. And so while these changes could help mitigate adverse impact on the VA sales, we do want to emphasize we think it's really still premature to offer any predictions as to what that impact will be. That's going to play out over multiple years through the lens of adviser behavior and firm behavior. So we'll see what that proves out to be. For Prudential Retirement, the third business I mentioned, the final regulation does contain meaningfully clearer delineation between investment advice and investment education. And we think that delineation will allow us to continue to offer our asset allocation services to the D.C. plans. It's come up on other calls about the sales exception for plans with 100 or more participants. In the original rule, that was changed to a $15 million or above in assets exemption or threshold. The bulk of our business focus on the larger case market, and we expect the vast preponderance of our business to continue to qualify for either exemption threshold."

Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings",1062,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings per share of $2.26, which excludes market-driven and discrete items, is below the $2.65 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was a little over 12%. We're modestly below the 13% to 14% that we target across the cycle. This, of course, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. 
At an overall level, we produced solid core results. However, the adverse impact of weaker non-coupon investment results, lower average equity markets and foreign currency headwinds drove the year-over-year decline from the particularly favorable results of a year ago. 
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and financial measures. I will provide some higher-level observations on our businesses and discuss other matters affecting our operations. 
Our  International business had a solid quarter despite the market challenges I mentioned. We continue to see strong underwriting margins and good core growth at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Interest rates in Japan are clearly a challenge, and we have made and will continue to make the necessary product and pricing changes to maintain strong returns I would highlight that our overall constant dollar sales growth of 12% was driven by U.S. dollar products in Japan, where we have seen an increase in demand. 
We also completed the acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement administrator. We're excited about the prospects of this business as we expand our international footprint and expect Habitat to produce steady growth and generate stable earnings and cash flows. It's taken a while to come to fruition, but we believe this investment and relationship is a very good fit for us. 
Our domestic businesses showed some mixed results, also largely reflecting market factors. At a high level, Individual Annuities continued to show solid margins, though sales levels have shown some pressure. And this reflects our pricing discipline as well as lower variable annuity sales industry-wide. 
Retirement earnings benefited from another quarter of solid case experience in our pension risk transfer business, which helped mitigate the impact of non-coupon investment returns coming in lower than our average expectation. Let me add that although we did not close any PRT deals in the quarter, we continue to see solid activity in the market. And as we've discussed on previous calls, the timing and distribution of the PRT transactions can be lumpy. 
Asset Management earnings were impacted by lower average equity assets under management and lighter earnings from other related revenues, particularly compared with recent trends. We also experienced weakness in third-party unaffiliated net flows, which showed net outflows of about $3 billion for the quarter. To put this in context, however, this follows very strong net flows in 2015 of $22 billion, and our pipeline for new mandates is robust. We remain optimistic on our Asset Management business and continue to invest in capabilities and distribution. But we're also not immune to some of the industry trends that have impacted active equity management strategies. 
Life insurance earnings were impacted by adverse underwriting results as compared to our average expectations, which is not unusual for us to see in the first quarter. This quarter, we experienced both a greater-than-typical volume of claims as well as a higher level of claims with larger face values. Over time, we've had significant favorable mortality, including since we acquired Hartford's life business in 2013, which, by the way, has proven to be a very good fit. But mortality can vary on a quarterly basis. We continue to show solid sales results, which has benefited from product and distribution actions, while maintaining underwriting discipline. 
And finally, our Group Insurance business continues to show the benefits to earnings of our multiyear underwriting efforts. We also saw an increase in sales levels following several years of weakness as we benefited from several large case wins in the quarter. 
Let me also briefly address a few other topics of interest. In April, we recaptured the variable annuity living benefit riders that we -- were managed in a captive insurer and now house all of our product risk together in our statutory insurance entities. This is a very important initiative that will meaningfully reduce the volatility in our business and increase transparency while not having adverse consequences on our capital flexibility. We will provide more details on this initiative with our second quarter results. 
The decision in favor of MetLife and their challenge to the FSOC designation as systemically important is a significant development with respect to group supervision and capital standards. We will determine an appropriate path for Prudential as this issue develops, considering other aspects of groups regulation as well. With respect to the FSOC designation, we have options as we go through our annual redesignation process. 
The fiduciary standard rule issued by the Department of Labor address some of the concerns expressed by the industry participants regarding the proposed rule and includes several positive changes. We continue to evaluate the new regulation and potential impacts on our business, which also needs to include consideration of how our distribution partners will respond. The final rule gives us a path forward to implement certain changes to our processes and businesses, including  in Individual Annuities, Retirement, Asset Management and our in-house distribution arm, Prudential Advisors. And while there will be challenges with the new rule, we have a history of adapting to change and will continue to support our customers with innovative solutions to meet their retirement needs. 
In terms of capital deployment, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter and funded approximately $530 million for our Chilean investment, all while maintaining strong capital flexibility. 
So to sum it up, while this quarter's results were a little light than we would normally expect due mainly to market factors, the fundamentals in our business remain sound and we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet and capital position that enables us to return substantial amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

Good morning, good afternoon or good evening, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. 
And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.18 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.39 from a year ago. While underlying business performance was solid, the decrease reflected a less favorable macro environment and negative fluctuations in some inherently variable items. 
Non-coupon investment returns were about $90 million, below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago when we called out a contribution about $60 million above expectations. 
Earnings from asset-based fees in our U.S. businesses were about $50 million below the year-ago level, largely reflecting the 5% decline in equity market averages. 
And the contribution from other related revenues in our Asset Management business, which is largely driven by changes in market values and timing of transactions, was $25 million below the year ago quarter. 
We estimate that these 3 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Now moving on to Slide 3. Returns on non-coupon investments fluctuate over a cycle by their nature. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, our long-term expected returns on these investments are 6% to 7% with our expectation for 2016 slightly below the long-term average. In our case, included in non-coupon or alternative investments are private equities, hedge funds, real estate and a $3.6 billion public equity portfolio held mainly in Japan, which includes stocks, mutual funds and JREITs These assets total about $8.8 billion as of March 31. 
While these investments diversify our exposure and are a good fit with some of our longer-term liabilities, especially in retirement, the pattern of returns introduces some variability into our results. We've called out significant variances from our average expectations, which provided a fairly strong tailwind in 2013 and 2014. However, returns are below the long-term expected average in the current quarter. 
We would estimate that current quarter variances, in comparison to our long-term average expectations from returns on non-coupon investments, mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience, together with the benefit of favorable revenue seasonality in our International Life Planner business, had a net negative impact on earnings per share of about $0.10. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $2.26 for the quarter implies an annualized ROE of 12%. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the current quarter. This compares to just over $2 billion a year ago, which included substantial mark-to-market gains from derivatives and hedging activities. 
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customers' accounts, which resulted in a net charge of $0.08 per share. 
Now moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $338 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pretax gains of $44 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $282 million in the quarter, driven by the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance through variable annuity living benefits, which increased due to the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The gain from other risk management derivatives also came mainly from the decline in interest rates. Impairments and credit losses of $106 million included $85 million from the energy sector, primarily on bonds. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. 
Annuities earnings were $381 million for the quarter, down by $42 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a similar decline in average account values, which was largely driven by equity market levels. Higher expenses and lower non-coupon investment returns, which were modestly below our average expectations, also contributed to the earnings decline and to the decrease in return on assets, or ROA, which has fluctuated in the low 100 basis point range. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Our sales mix continues to reflect our product diversification strategy, which we enhanced in April of last year with an agreement to reinsure about half of the living benefit guarantees on new business related to our highest daily, or HD, product. This agreement extends through this year. 
We've also grown sales of our fixed income-based PDI product with some recent small adjustments to enhance product attractiveness. As a result, only about 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefits guarantees. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $219 million for the quarter, down by $65 million from a year ago. The decrease included a $36 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $40 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $15 million above-average expectations a year ago. The decrease in non-coupon returns was partly offset by the impact of growth of the investment base over the past year. Contribution from case experience was about $20 million below the year ago quarter but roughly $20 million above our average quarterly expectation. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower fees in our Full Service business and higher expenses. The sequential quarter in earnings from Retirement mainly reflects lower expenses compared to the elevated level of the fourth quarter and a greater contribution from case experience than in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.7 billion for the current quarter compared to $7.3 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion for the quarter, largely driven by stable value wrap products, compared to sales of roughly $1 billion a year ago, which included about $660 million for a funded PRT case. Full Service sales were roughly in line with the year ago. Total retirement account values amounted to $372 billion at the end of the quarter, up by about $7 billion from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $5 billion from our Full Service business and about $2 billion from our institutional stand-alone business. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $165 million for the quarter compared to $205 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $25 million lower contribution from other related revenues, reflecting strong strategic investing results and incentive fees in the year ago quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower Asset Management fees, driven by a 12% decline in average equity assets under management, which reflected both outflows and negative market impact. Higher fees from management of fixed-income assets with a 5% increase in average assets under management partly offset the equity-driven decline. 
After $22 billion of net positive third-party flows in 2015, we experienced outflows of $3 billion in the current quarter, nearly all driven by equity strategies. As John indicated, we are seeing the impact of industry trends, including movement to passive strategies as well as some client rebalancing. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $120 million for the quarter compared to $125 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher expenses, including costs supporting business growth. The net contribution from claims experience was essentially unchanged from a year ago but about $35 million below our average expectations. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect the lower contribution for mortality than the average for the year. The contribution from net investment results was essentially unchanged from a year ago. Lower returns on non-coupon investments, which were about $10 million below our average expectations, were offset by the benefits from a larger investment base. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were up $21 million or 17% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed about half of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced last year to bring our rates more in line with the market. We continually monitor expected returns and competitor action. And in February, we implemented modest price increases. The remainder of the increase in sales came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Moving now to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $26 million for the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. A lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations, together with higher expenses, more than offset more favorable underwriting results driven by Group Life. The current quarter total benefits ratio was more favorable than a year ago and within our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Turning to Slide 14. Group Insurance sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were $311 million for the quarter, nearly double the level of a year ago. More sales occur in the first quarter based on calendar year inception. Following the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years, we did see an increase in sales of both Group Life and Group Disability, including more larger cases. 
Moving now to International Insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings of our Life Planner business were $410 million for the quarter compared to $439 million a year ago. Excluding a $30 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by less favorable mortality experience, higher expenses, including nonlinear items such as legal and business development costs, and a lower contribution from investment results, including non-coupon investment returns about $5 million below our average expectations. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially consistent with our average expectations but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. 
A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $30 million in relation to our quarterly average. 
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $369 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $28 million on the comparison of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Looking at some key components. The benefits to earnings from business growth, including the initial contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, were offset by a lower contribution from investment results of about $40 million. Business growth drove an increase in earnings of about $20 million with about half from Chile, including above-average returns on the co-investment in the managed funds, otherwise known as the encaje. The contribution to earnings from mortality experience, which was about $5 million more favorable than our average expectations, exceeded the year ago quarter by about $15 million. Net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter compared to about $40 million above expectations a year ago. This $60 million variance was partly offset by benefits to spread results, including higher prepayment income and growth in the base of invested assets. 
Turning to Slide 17. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $781 million for the current quarter, up by $86 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and by Gibraltar's bank channel and Life Consultant. About 45% of our current quarter sales in Japan were U.S.-dollar products compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were also up by 15% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased by 27%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product and by Death Protection products. Life Consultant sales increased by 10%, benefiting from a recently introduced U.S. dollar whole life product that has been popular among clients seeking maximum death protection in early contract years. 
Turning to Slide 18. The Corporate and Other loss was $312 million for the current quarter compared to $253 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a benefit in the year ago quarter from returns on assets from our Closed Block restructuring that were subsequently deployed in our businesses; and higher expenses, including items such as legal costs, which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to give an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 19. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484% with total adjusted capital, or CAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solid margins of 877% and 929%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, December 31, 2015. We expect these ratios to be above our targets as of their fiscal year-end on March 31. 
Looking at liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 20. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $1 billion from year-end was driven primarily by our shareholder distributions, debt reduction and acquisition funding. The excess over our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of March 31 remained within our targets. 
During the first quarter, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders, including $375 million of share repurchases under the $1.5 billion authorization for the year. And in March, we funded the purchase of our stake in AFP Habitat in Chile with a purchase price of about $530 million. As John noted, we maintained our capital capacity at a level not meaningfully different than what we reported at year-end. 
Let me provide an update on a few other noteworthy items. The fair value of our yen equity hedge was about $760 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.7 billion at year-end. The decline in fair value is, as expected, in response to the 7% strengthening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar during the quarter and corresponds to an increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent of yen earnings in Japan over time. Expected cash flows from the yen hedge in 2016 reflects scheduled settlements that are essentially unaffected by the change in fair value. While the fair value of our equity hedge declined sequentially, they continue to operate as designed to protect the value of our businesses and the overall return profile against currency moves in our largest overseas operation. 
On our energy holdings. Our net unrealized loss on the energy sector fixed maturities, excluding the Closed Block, at the end of the quarter was about $200 million, essentially unchanged from year-end. 83% of fixed maturities were investment grade. 
To update you on variable annuity recapture, on April 1, we recaptured the living benefits risks from our captive reinsurer, moving the rider risks into our statutory insurance companies to be managed together with the base contracts. This marks a major milestone in our initiative, which is on track for completion over the course of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

But we have, I think, proactively either eliminated products or lowered crediting rates or commissions, and we've been doing that for some period of time. In the last earnings call, I think I articulated that we stopped selling any single premium life or Retirement products in the third-party channels and we produced crediting rates in some of the -- in our other captive channels. So we will continue to monitor this very closely. The other way it's affected us, I think, is that we have sold more U.S. dollar products, and we've done that for a couple of reasons. One, as you said, rates are much lower in Japan. So on a relative basis, they're better in the U.S. But also, the appreciation of the yen has led people to think, gosh, with yen, I can buy more dollars and, therefore, U.S. dollar products are more attractive. And with the wide range of suites -- the suite of a wide range of products that we have in the U.S., I think our product offering is quite attractive. So we have, if you will, taken advantage of the lower rates by virtue of the products we -- that we offer, and we'll continue to very proactively manage our product mix in order to protect margin."

So as we've mentioned in the past, our businesses generate a significant amount of capital and there was no change from that in the first quarter. And I think we've provided sort of rules of thumb that are helpful around that, and that's the fact that about 60% of our operating earnings translate into free cash flow, you see. You can think about that, well, as it varies any given quarter. You can think about that as being a capital generating capacity in the form of free cash flow. And as I said, that's sort of representative of what we'd see over a longer term but also in the first quarter. The -- there were significant capital deployment actions during the course of the quarter. So as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we had about $0.7 billion of shareholder distributions. That was in the form of both share repurchases. And that's at an elevated level. Recall that we increased our buyback program by about $0.5 billion at the end of last year. For this year, we increased it from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And it was also in dividends. And recall that we also increased that dividend rate by -- in excess of 20% last year. So those were the distributions. We funded about $0.5 billion from our Chilean acquisition. Now that we had already earmarked from our capital capacity that we articulated at the end of the year because it was an imminent transaction. So when you think about apples to apples, the Chilean acquisition was already taken out of the capacity number. And so the remaining variable was the fact that we reduced our debt by about $0.25 billion. It was maturing and we paid that off. So as I was thinking about sort of going from year-end to the end of this quarter, that you generated internal capital capacity that was sufficient to fund our shareholder distributions. The M&A activity and strategic investments were taken care of in our prior allocation of capital, and you have left the debt reduction, which would be sort of a -- maybe a placeholder for the order of magnitude of change in our total capital capacity from year-end to where we are now."

So first, the hedge is doing exactly what it was designed to do. The -- we've been -- as and if the yen has depreciated, we brought -- that has yielded proceeds to us, we've been able to take those proceeds and redeploy them either in the form of share repurchases or in the form of investments in order to restore the ROE that otherwise would have been lost by virtue of the depreciation in the yen. To your point, as the yen appreciates, you get things that could go the other direction. So hedge settlements would go -- instead of from the Japanese companies to the holding company, they would go the other way. However, the point is that ROE is protected in either direction, and we've actually experienced this in the past. The higher yen earnings contribute to sustaining our targeted enterprise ROE because what happens is, over time, our yen earnings are higher, it creates that greater dividend capacity, and that translates ultimately into greater U.S. dollar dividends coming back to us. So when we actually think about that yen hedge, it creates capital capacity when there's a depreciating yen. When there's an appreciating yen, what happens is we have something that I would consider to be more of a liquidity issue, which is we temporarily have to fund the mark on those going down to the Japanese companies, but that ultimately works its way back to us in the form of higher earnings and greater dividends coming back to the holding company."

Obviously, market conditions have, in some cases, impacted funding levels. But we've also seen, especially in the large-case market that we specialize in, we've seen plan sponsors undertake steps to protect those funding levels through various types of hedging instruments, not with us but in their investment activities. So like I say, we still see a healthy pipeline. I will mention that since the close of the quarter, we have announced a longevity deal in the U.K. with Legal & General of less than $500 million.

The customer's foreign exchange risk is exposed therefore to the possibility that down the road, either when the customer retires or the customer dies, the family will receive less money than the customer thought because of a weakening of the yen when a customer's family receives or customer in retirement receives dollar investments.

And so it's a kind of a 2-part question. One, do you think that the distributor rather than the manufacturer would be the one who is a party to the legal risk of the Best Interest Contract? And if that is the case, can you characterize your conversations with your distribution thus far and kind of how constructive they are so far on being able to sell VAs under the BIC?"

I'm not going to get into an apportionment of legal liability. I'm sure you'll understand that. But I would say that -- I would point out that manufacturers will have a responsibility to perform certain processes and provide certain information to distributors so that they can fulfill their obligations under the contract. And we are making the necessary preparations to do exactly that. I think, if I could, just to address some other questions that I know have come up on other calls regarding the DOL just to make some broader comments. The final rule does contain some meaningful improvements. We still think it creates significant challenges and changes in the industry as a whole. It can increase compliance costs, although I would say that, that's not an overly consequential matter for a company of our size. And it can also contain, as you were pointing out, increased exposure to legal claims. Now as such, we think it's more important than ever to really avoid those unintended consequences that we spoke about last summer on Investor Day and ensure continued access to education, advice and product solutions. That's the position we've taken consistently and we'll continue to do so. If you look at our 3 businesses most impacted on Prudential Advisors, and here I'm more talking about differences between the original regulation and the final one, if you look at Prudential Advisors, the final rule did make the process for obtaining the required contract under the BIC exception less onerous than it originally was. And it also permits us to deal with, on a negative consent basis, with clients who had accounts established prior to the beginning of 2018. So that's helpful. Final rule also clarified how proprietary products can be sold to IRA owners, providing we address some significant new requirements. Again, that's useful. So for Prudential Advisors, compliance and business processes will change. And we'll be ready for those changes and we fully expect that unit to continue to play an important role in our distribution strategy. For Annuities, and you touched upon this in your question, Randy, the DOL did attempt to clarify the circumstances under which higher compensation for the sale of more complex products continue -- requiring more upfront time by the adviser is permissible so long as that compensation is reasonable. And what that means will be -- will play out over time. The final rule did not include an exemption that would have favored lower-cost products, such as index funds, over higher-cost, higher-value products. And so while these changes could help mitigate adverse impact on the VA sales, we do want to emphasize we think it's really still premature to offer any predictions as to what that impact will be. That's going to play out over multiple years through the lens of adviser behavior and firm behavior. So we'll see what that proves out to be. For Prudential Retirement, the third business I had mentioned, the final regulation does contain a meaningfully clearer delineation between investment advice and investment education, and we think that delineation will allow us to continue to offer our asset allocation services to DC plans. The -- it's come up on other calls about the sales exception for plans with 100 or more participants. In the original rule, that was changed to a $15 million or above in assets exemption or threshold. The bulk of our business focuses in the larger-case market, and we expect the vast preponderance of our business to continue to qualify for either exemption threshold."

Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings",1062,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings per share of $2.26, which excludes market-driven and discrete items, is below the $2.65 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was a little over 12%. We're modestly below the 13% to 14% that we target across a cycle. This, of course, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. 
At an overall level, we produced solid core results. However, the adverse impact of weaker non-coupon investment results, lower average equity markets and foreign currency headwinds drove the year-over-year decline from the particularly favorable results of a year ago. 
Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and financial measures. I will provide some higher-level observations on our businesses and discuss other matters affecting our operations. 
Our International business had a solid quarter despite the market challenges I mentioned. We continue to see strong underwriting margins and good core growth at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Interest rates in Japan are clearly a challenge, and we have made and will continue to make the necessary product and pricing changes to maintain strong returns I would highlight that our overall constant dollar sales growth of 12% was driven by U.S. dollar products in Japan, where we have seen an increase in demand. 
We also completed the acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement administrator. We're excited about the prospects of this business as we expand our international footprint and expect Habitat to produce steady growth and generate stable earnings and cash flows. It's taken a while to come to fruition, but we believe this investment and relationship is a very good fit for us. 
Our domestic businesses showed some mixed results, also largely reflecting market factors. At a high level, Individual Annuities continued to show solid margins, though sales levels have shown some pressure. And this reflects our pricing discipline as well as lower variable annuity sales industry-wide. 
Retirement earnings benefited from another quarter of solid case experience in our pension risk transfer business, which helped mitigate the impact of non-coupon investment returns coming in lower than our average expectation. Let me add that although we did not close any PRT deals in the quarter, we continue to see solid activity in the market. And as we've discussed on previous calls, the timing and distribution of the PRT transactions can be lumpy. 
Asset Management earnings were impacted by lower average equity assets under management and lighter earnings from other related revenues, particularly compared with recent trends. We also experienced weakness in third-party unaffiliated net flows, which showed net outflows of about $3 billion for the quarter. To put this in context, however, this follows very strong net flows in 2015 of $22 billion, and our pipeline for new mandates is robust. We remain optimistic on our Asset Management business and continue to invest in capabilities and distribution. But we're also not immune to some of the industry trends that have impacted active equity management strategies. 
Life insurance earnings were impacted by adverse underwriting results as compared to our average expectations, which is not unusual for us to see in the first quarter. This quarter, we experienced both a greater-than-typical volume of claims as well as a higher level of claims with larger face values. Over time, we've had significant favorable mortality, including since we acquired Hartford's life business in 2013, which, by the way, has proven to be a very good fit. But mortality can vary on a quarterly basis. We continue to show solid sales results, which has benefited from product and distribution actions, while maintaining underwriting discipline. 
And finally, our Group Insurance business continues to show the benefits to earnings of our multiyear underwriting efforts. We also saw an increase in sales levels following several years of weakness as we benefited from several large case wins in the quarter. 
Let me also briefly address a few other topics of interest. In April, we recaptured the variable annuity living benefit riders that we -- were managed in a captive insurer and now house all of our product risk together in our statutory insurance entities. This is a very important initiative that will meaningfully reduce the volatility in our business and increase transparency while not having adverse consequences on our capital flexibility. We will provide more details on this initiative with our second quarter results. 
The decision in favor of MetLife and their challenge to the FSOC designation as systemically important is a significant development with respect to group supervision and capital standards. We will determine an appropriate path for Prudential as this issue develops, considering other aspects of groups regulation as well. With respect to the FSOC designation, we have options as we go through our annual redesignation process. 
The fiduciary standard rule issued by the Department of Labor address some of the concerns expressed by the industry participants regarding the proposed rule and includes several positive changes. We continue to evaluate the new regulation and potential impacts on our business, which also needs to include consideration of how our distribution partners will respond. The final rule gives us a path forward to implement certain changes to our processes and businesses, including in Individual Annuities, Retirement, Asset Management and our in-house distribution arm, Prudential Advisors. And while there will be challenges with the new rule, we have a history of adapting to change and will continue to support our customers with innovative solutions to meet their retirement needs. 
In terms of capital deployment, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter and funded approximately $530 million for our Chilean investment, all while maintaining strong capital flexibility. 
So to sum it up, while this quarter's results were a little light than we would normally expect due mainly to market factors, the fundamentals in our business remain sound and we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet and capital position that enables us to return substantial amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

And I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.18 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.39 from a year ago. While underlying business performance was solid, the decrease reflected a less favorable macro environment and negative fluctuations in some inherently variable items. 
Non-coupon investment returns were about $90 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago when we called out a contribution about $60 million above expectations. 
Earnings from asset-based fees in our U.S. businesses were about $50 million below the year-ago level, largely reflecting the 5% decline in equity market averages. 
And the contribution from other related revenues in our Asset Management business, which is largely driven by changes in market values and timing of transactions, was $25 million below the year ago quarter. 
We estimate that these 3 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Now moving on to Slide 3. Returns on non-coupon investments fluctuate over a cycle by their nature. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, our long-term expected returns on these investments are 6% to 7% with our expectation for 2016 slightly below the long-term average. In our case, included in non-coupon or alternative investments are private equities, hedge funds, real estate and a $3.6 billion public equity portfolio held mainly in Japan, which includes stocks, mutual funds and JREITs These assets total about $8.8 billion as of March 31. 
While these investments diversify our exposure and are a good fit with some of our longer-term liabilities, especially in retirement, the pattern of returns introduces some variability into our results. We've called out significant variances from our average expectations, which provided a fairly strong tailwind in 2013 and 2014. However, returns are below the long-term expected average in the current quarter. 
We would estimate that current quarter variances, in comparison to our long-term average expectations from returns on non-coupon investments, mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience, together with the benefit of favorable revenue seasonality in our International Life Planner business, had a net negative impact on earnings per share of about $0.10. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $2.26 for the quarter implies an annualized ROE of 12%. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the current quarter. This compares to just over $2 billion a year ago, which included substantial mark-to-market gains from derivatives and hedging activities. 
Turning to Slide 4. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customers' accounts, which resulted in a net charge of $0.08 per share. 
Now moving to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $338 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pretax gains of $44 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $282 million in the quarter, driven by the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance through variable annuity living benefits, which increased due to the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The gain from other risk management derivatives also came mainly from the decline in interest rates. Impairments and credit losses of $106 million included $85 million from the energy sector, primarily on bonds. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. 
Annuities earnings were $381 million for the quarter, down by $42 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a similar decline in average account values, which was largely driven by equity market levels. Higher expenses and lower non-coupon investment returns, which were modestly below our average expectations, also contributed to the earnings decline and to the decrease in return on assets, or ROA, which has fluctuated in the low 100 basis point range. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Our sales mix continues to reflect our product diversification strategy, which we enhanced in April of last year with an agreement to reinsure about half of the living benefit guarantees on new business related to our highest daily, or HD, product. This agreement extends through this year. 
We've also grown sales of our fixed income-based PDI product, with some recent small adjustments to enhance product attractiveness. As a result, only about 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $219 million for the quarter, down by $65 million from a year ago. The decrease included a $36 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $40 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $15 million above-average expectations a year ago. The decrease in non-coupon returns was partly offset by the impact of growth of the investment base over the past year. Contribution from case experience was about $20 million below the year ago quarter but roughly $20 million above our average quarterly expectation. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower fees in our Full Service business and higher expenses. The sequential quarter in earnings from Retirement mainly reflects lower expenses compared to the elevated level of the fourth quarter and a greater contribution from case experience than in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.7 billion for the current quarter compared to $7.3 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion for the quarter, largely driven by stable value wrap products, compared to sales of roughly $1 billion a year ago, which included about $660 million for a funded PRT case. Full Service sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Total retirement account values amounted to $372 billion at the end of the quarter, up by about $7 billion from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $5 billion from our Full Service business and about $2 billion from our institutional stand-alone business. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $165 million for the quarter compared to $205 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $25 million lower contribution from other related revenues, reflecting strong strategic investing results and incentive fees in the year ago quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower Asset Management fees, driven by a 12% decline in average equity assets under management, which reflected both outflows and negative market impact. Higher fees from management of fixed-income assets with a 5% increase in average assets under management partly offset the equity-driven decline. 
After $22 billion of net positive third-party flows in 2015, we experienced outflows of $3 billion in the current quarter, nearly all driven by equity strategies. As John indicated, we are seeing the impact of industry trends, including movement to passive strategies as well as some client rebalancing. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $120 million for the quarter compared to $125 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher expenses, including costs supporting business growth. The net contribution from claims experience was essentially unchanged from a year ago but about $35 million below our average expectations. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect the lower contribution for mortality than the average for the year. The contribution from net investment results was essentially unchanged from a year ago. Lower returns on non-coupon investments, which were about $10 million below our average expectations, were offset by the benefits from a larger investment base. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were up $21 million or 17% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed about half of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we repriced last year to bring our rates more in line with the market. We continually monitor expected returns and competitor actions, and in February, we implemented modest price increases. The remainder of the increase in sales came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Moving now to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $26 million for the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. A lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations, together with higher expenses, more than offset more favorable underwriting results driven by Group Life. The current quarter total benefits ratio was more favorable than a year ago and within our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Turning to Slide 14. Group Insurance sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were $311 million for the quarter, nearly double the level of a year ago. Most sales occur in the first quarter based on calendar year inception. Following the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years, we did see an increase in sales of both Group Life and Group Disability, including more larger cases. 
Moving now to International Insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings of our Life Planner business were $410 million for the quarter compared to $439 million a year ago. Excluding a $30 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by less favorable mortality experience, higher expenses, including nonlinear items such as legal and business development costs, and a lower contribution from investment results, including non-coupon investment returns about $5 million below our average expectations. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially consistent with our average expectations but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. 
A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $30 million in relation to a quarterly average. 
Turning to Slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $369 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $28 million on the comparison of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Looking at some key components. The benefits to earnings from business growth, including the initial contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, were offset by a lower contribution from investment results of about $40 million. Business growth drove an increase in earnings of about $20 million, with about half from Chile, including above-average returns on the co-investment in the managed funds, otherwise known as the encaje. The contribution to earnings from mortality experience, which was about $5 million more favorable than our average expectations, exceeded the year ago quarter by about $15 million. Net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter compared to about $40 million above expectations a year ago. This $60 million variance was partly offset by benefits to spread results, including higher prepayment income and growth in the base of invested assets. 
Turning to Slide 17. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $781 million for the current quarter, up by $86 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and by Gibraltar's bank channel and Life Consultants. About 45% of our current quarter sales in Japan were U.S.-dollar products compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were also up by 15% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased by 27%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product and by Death Protection products. Life Consultant sales increased by 10%, benefiting from a recently introduced U.S. dollar whole life product that has been popular among clients seeking maximum death protection in early contract years. 
Turning to Slide 18. The Corporate and Other loss was $312 million for the current quarter compared to a $253 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a benefit in the year ago quarter from returns on assets from our Closed Block restructuring that were subsequently deployed in our businesses; and higher expenses, including items such as legal costs, which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484%, with total adjusted capital, or CA",524,"Thank you, Mark. I'm going to give an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 19. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484%, with total adjusted capital, or CAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solid margins of 877% and 929%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, December 31, 2015. We expect these ratios to be above our targets as of their fiscal year-end on March 31. 
Looking at liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 20. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $1 billion from year-end was driven primarily by our shareholder distributions, debt reduction and acquisition funding. The excess over our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of March 31 remained within our targets. 
During the first quarter, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders, including $375 million of share repurchases under the $1.5 billion authorization for the year. And in March, we funded the purchase of our stake in AFP Habitat in Chile with a purchase price of about $530 million. As John noted, we maintained our capital capacity at a level not meaningfully different than what we reported at year-end. 
Let me provide an update on a few other noteworthy items. The fair value of our yen equity hedge was about $760 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.7 billion at year-end. The decline in fair value is, as expected, in response to the 7% strengthening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar during the quarter and corresponds to an increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent of yen earnings in Japan over time. Expected cash flows from the yen hedge in 2016 reflects scheduled settlements that are essentially unaffected by the change in fair value. While the fair value of our equity hedge declined sequentially, it continued to operate as designed to protect the value of our businesses and the overall return profile against currency moves in our largest overseas operation. 
On our energy holdings. Our net unrealized loss on the energy sector fixed maturities, excluding the Closed Block, at the end of the quarter was about $200 million, essentially unchanged from year-end. 83% of fixed maturities were investment grade. 
To update you on the variable annuity recapture, on April 1, we recaptured the living benefits risks from our captive reinsurer, moving the rider risks into our statutory insurance companies to be managed together with the base contracts. This marks a major milestone in our initiative, which is on track for completion over the course of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

So we will continue to monitor this very closely. The other way it's affected us, I think, is that we have sold more U.S. dollar products, and we've done that for a couple of reasons. One, as you said, rates are much lower in Japan. So on a relative basis, they're better in the U.S. But also, the appreciation of the yen has led people to think, gosh, with yen, I can buy more dollars and, therefore, U.S. dollar products are more attractive. And with the wide range of suites -- the suite of a wide range of products that we have in the U.S., I think our product offering is quite attractive. So we have, if you will, taken advantage of the lower rates by virtue of the product suites that we offer, and we'll continue to very proactively manage our product mix in order to protect margin."

So as we've mentioned in the past, our businesses generate a significant amount of capital and there was no change from that in the first quarter. And I think we've provided sort of rules of thumb that are helpful around that, and that's the fact that about 60% of our operating earnings translate into free cash flow, you see. You can think about that - while it varies in any given quarter, you can think about that as being a capital-generating capacity in the form of free cash flow. And as I said, that's sort of representative of what we'd see over a longer term but also in the first quarter. The -- there were significant capital deployment actions during the course of the quarter. So as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we had about $0.7 billion of shareholder distributions. That was in the form of both share repurchases. And that's at an elevated level. Recall that we increased our buyback program by about $0.5 billion at the end of last year. For this year, we increased it from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And it was also in dividends. And recall that we also increased that dividend rate by -- in excess of 20% last year. So those were the distributions. We funded about $0.5 billion from our Chilean acquisition. Now that we had already earmarked from our capital capacity that we articulated at the end of the year because it was an imminent transaction. So when you think about apples-to-apples, the Chilean acquisition was already taken out of the capacity number. And so the remaining variable was the fact that we reduced our debt by about $0.25 billion. It was maturing and we paid that off. So as I -- as thinking about sort of going from year-end to the end of this quarter, that you generated internal capital capacity. That was sufficient to fund our shareholder distributions. The M&A activity and strategic investments were taken care of in our prior allocation of capital. And you have left the debt reduction, which would be sort of a -- maybe a placeholder for the order of magnitude of change in our total capital capacity from year-end to where we are now."

To your point, as the yen appreciates, you get things that could go the other direction. So hedge settlements would go, instead of from the Japanese companies to the holding company, they would go the other way. However, the point is that ROE is protected in either direction, and we've actually experienced this in the past. The higher yen earnings contribute to sustaining our targeted enterprise ROE because what happens is, over time, our yen earnings are higher, it creates greater dividend capacity, and that translates ultimately into greater U.S. dollar dividends coming back to us. So when we actually think about that yen hedge, it creates capital capacity when there's a depreciating yen. When there's an appreciating yen, what happens is we have something that I would consider to be more of a liquidity issue, which is we temporarily have to fund the mark on those going down to the Japanese companies, but that ultimately works its way back to us in the form of higher earnings and greater dividends coming back to the holding company."

First, with regard to this year particularly, as I alluded to in my introductory remarks, we actually have locked in our settlements for this year. So we have about $0.5 billion for the entire year of pretax gains that are locked in for the year and, in fact, will be coming our way regardless of what happens to the yen rate during the course of this year. That's one. Two, the settlements beyond this year are actually staged out over long periods of time, and that is -- and actually with the intent of trying to match up dividend paying capacity against settlements that we might otherwise have against those hedges. So we're actually very conscious of that in ensuring that it doesn't create a short-term liquidity dislocation."

When it comes to interest rates, a big impact on propensity to transact is not just what rates are today but what is a plan sponsor's expectations about rates in the future.

Obviously, market conditions have, in some cases, impacted funding levels. But we've also seen, especially in the large-case market that we specialize in, we've seen plan sponsors undertake steps to protect those funding levels through various types of hedging instruments, not with us but in their investment activities. So like I say, we still see a healthy pipeline. I will mention that since the close of the quarter, we have announced a longevity deal in the U.K. with Legal & General of less than $500 million. So as I say, we still see healthy pipeline. And when you consider the increasing awareness of the longevity risk, when you consider the rising PBGC premiums, we still see lots of inclination for plan sponsors to pursue this solution."

I presume that in the typical transaction, the customer is not hedging. The customer's foreign exchange risk is exposed, therefore, to the possibility that down the road, either when the customer retires or the customer dies, the family will receive less money than the customer thought because of a weakening of the yen when a customer's family receives or customer in retirement receives dollar investments. What's your sense of why these -- why the customers are willing to take this FX risk?

I think the issue with Japanese consumers is one of having lived with a low interest rate environment for a long, long period of time and looking at the interest rate differential with the U.S. And yes, you are right. They do take the FX risks. But over time, their -- what they believe and what their experience, frankly, has been is that the FX risk is not as great as the interest rate differential and, therefore, and they're willing to do that. You've seen it with the U.S. dollar product and you've seen it with the Aussie dollar product. And they're very savvy because they'll go back and forth from time to time. Now most of the product that we sell, as Mark suggested, is life insurance based. It's protection based. So they buy it for different reasons. It's not savings products per se.

And so it's a kind of a 2-part question. One, do you think that the distributor rather than the manufacturer would be the one who is a party to the legal risk of the Best Interest Contract? And if that is the case, can you characterize your conversations with your distribution thus far and kind of how constructive they are so far on being able to sell VAs under the BIC?"

I'm not going to get into an apportionment of legal liability. I'm sure you'll understand that. But I would say that -- I would point out that manufacturers will have a responsibility to perform certain processes and provide certain information to distributors so that they can fulfill their obligations under the contract. And we are making the necessary preparations to do exactly that. I think, if I could, just to address some other questions that I know have come up on other calls regarding the DOL, just to make some broader comments. The final rule does contain some meaningful improvements. We still think it creates significant challenges and changes in the industry as a whole. It can increase compliance costs, although I would say that, that's not an overly consequential matter for a company of our size. And it can also contain, as you were pointing out, increased exposure to legal claims. Now as such, we think it's more important than ever to really avoid those unintended consequences that we spoke about last summer on Investor Day and ensure continued access to education, advice and product solutions. That's the position we've taken consistently and we'll continue to do so. If you look at our 3 businesses most impacted on Prudential Advisors, and here I'm more talking about differences between the original regulation and the final one, if you look at Prudential Advisors, the final rule did make the process for obtaining the required contract under the BIC exception less onerous than it originally was. And it also permits us to deal with, on a negative consent basis, with clients who had accounts established prior to the beginning of 2018. So that's helpful. Final rule also clarified how proprietary products can be sold to IRA owners, providing we address some significant new requirements. Again, that's useful. So for Prudential Advisors, compliance and business processes will change. And we'll be ready for those changes and we fully expect that unit to continue to play an important role in our distribution strategy. For Annuities, and you touched upon this in your question, Randy, the DOL did attempt to clarify the circumstances under which higher compensation for the sale of more complex products continue -- requiring more upfront time by the adviser is permissible so long as that compensation is reasonable. And what that means will be -- will play out over time. The final rule did not include an exemption that would have favored lower-cost products, such as index funds over higher-cost, higher-value products. And so while these changes could help mitigate adverse impact on the VA sales, we do want to emphasize we think it's really still premature to offer any predictions as to what that impact will be. That's going to play out over multiple years through the lens of adviser behavior and firm behavior. So we'll see what that proves out to be. For Prudential Retirement, the third business I had mentioned, the final regulation does contain a meaningfully clearer delineation between investment advice and investment education, and we think that delineation will allow us to continue to offer our asset allocation services to DC plans. The -- it's come up on other calls about the sales exception for plans with 100 or more participants. In the original rule, that was changed to a $50 million or above in assets exemption or threshold. The bulk of our business focuses in the larger-case market, and we expect the vast preponderance of our business to continue to qualify for either exemption threshold."

I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduced volatility, which directly led to last evening's announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016. In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob. 
We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefited from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are, therefore, able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties. At the same time, we are also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone. 
Now specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of our actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse affect on adjusted operating income. This is largely due to the change we took in Individual Life business related to recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail. 
If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis for the quarter at just over 13% [ph] was also consistent with our longer-term target. 
In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower, and in some cases, negative interest rate environment. 
Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses. Our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant-currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter. This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and our distribution strength. 
Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. Our asset management business had strong results, reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. It again exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we're particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about prospects and are investing and expanding capabilities and distribution. 
Our Retirement and Individual Annuities businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on 2 significant U.K. longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy, but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth basis and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform. 
I would also highlight that Retirement earnings, again, reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience at PRT block has well exceeded our expectations. 
Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth, following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this reflect the rate on a quarterly basis and the longer-term mortality trend has been very good. 
Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. 
Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time a clearer line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions. As a result of this substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty in cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future. And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. 
And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or ANPR, that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities, and the NPR, focused on corporate governance risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Starting on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from a year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment. The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from Corporate and Other operations driven by negative fluctuations and expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable International Insurance revenue seasonality. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further. 
Turning to Slide 3. This year's annual actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pretax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI, totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our Annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience. While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. 
The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by our recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the universal life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecasts at the time of The Hartford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for costs of our $500 million debt tender offer in June. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million and divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pretax losses of $68 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on Annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits, which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters and about half the level of the first quarter. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets for ROA. ROA was modestly below 100 basis point range of the past few quarters. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year, reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we are externally reinsuring about half of the living benefit guarantee on new business related to the highest daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantee. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago, which included 3 significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including about $2 billion from 2 new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $500 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segments results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by asset management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The Asset Management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive third-party flows in the quarter, with contributions from institutional and retail businesses, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year-ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in individual insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase, reflecting current quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91%, with current quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past 4 quarters. 
Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including cost supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline. 
Turning to Slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure. The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations, driven by real estate sale within investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million. 
Turning to Slide 16. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise more than half of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset liability management for our in force business. We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions, and in some cases, sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan, while adopting the product portfolio, reflects the skills of our Life Planners and life consultants in matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. 
Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago, including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with the year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales. 
Turning to Slide 17. The Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting the charge of about $40 million from the declining value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method; higher expenses, including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs, all of which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefits risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of the substantial portion of our in force annuity business. As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC or Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength. Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 19. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows, including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders, including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt, including $500 million under our tender offer in June. 
Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. 
Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter. While we evaluate shareholder distributions with the board in every quarter, we expect to move the routine dividend evaluation process to the first quarter in order to better align with our capital planning cycle.

It's protecting our ROE regardless of the direction of the yen. Our [indiscernible] today settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to completely offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77. Specifically to your question, we've had periods in the past where the yen -- where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international business as those settled. They are staged over time. And so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis -- or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen. And therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes in the settlement of the hedges.

So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star and Edison, they're about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done in both independent agency and the channels, we reduced number of relationships, focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit the bank partners and we chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners who currently offer our products and we sell about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter. But there are 3 points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've [indiscernible] to the banks. And they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service. We don't compete via spreadsheets. The second is we focus on Death Protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins obviously. And the other point here is that the -- we have a very high proportion of recurring premiums on products as opposed to just savings products. So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums. And that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the bank's mentality, our partners mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold. And the third is the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are repriced twice a month for a new process. And they also have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now we really sell only U.S. dollar products because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell and the resulting profitability of the business."

First, important to point out that we've had a significant reduction in our interest rate sensitivity post the completion of the VA captive initiative.

Importantly, we eliminated internal corporate hedge, under hedge, excuse me, as indicated in my opening comments. And we're managing all of the VA risks within the same legal entities. I'd also note that we manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our AA targets through cyclical stress scenarios.

Because I think our view of this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and our circumstances. So for us, asset management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our client and us. By that, what I mean is it's not holding in which we have a passive ownership stake, as some do, and nor is it a department to serving one line. It what it is, it's a business and it's a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And it's market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain top-flight investment talent, which in turn produces a consistent investment results that are very, very favorable. At this point, it's got over $1 trillion in AUM. As we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets, and actually, in terms of asset management fees, almost 80 -- roughly 80% of them are from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business, but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind, we have more fixed income assets than we have equity. So we sort of benefit from that phase of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor and benefit -- as well as beneficiary of this in a relationship with other parts of PRU. And you see that manifested in a lot of ways, which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas, whether it's PRT, enrollment asset management plays there, or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan, but the role of the private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us, it's very distinctive in relation to others, it's not holding in which we have a passive state. It's not a department. It's a hybrid. And it's doing very, very well. Doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well."

You referenced equity outflows in the industry. And we've seen that as well. In our case, it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S.-style-box strategies. I want to point out, however, that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total AUM. Nevertheless, we're addressing that in 2 levels. First, within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend. Among those, I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation, but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen. Second and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows. And it continues to give us confidence in our prospects going forward."

First of all, tactical level, we continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I said, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis.

I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the Annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch 2 years ago, only 2 years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter, half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance.

I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduced volatility, which directly led to last evening's announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016. In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob. 
We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefit from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are, therefore, able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties. At the same time, we are also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone. 
Now specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of our actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse affect on adjusted operating income. This is largely due to the change we took in our Individual Life business related to a recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail. 
If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis for the quarter at just over 13% was also consistent with our longer-term target. 
In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower, and in some cases, negative interest rate environment. 
Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses. Our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant-currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter. This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and our distribution strength. 
Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. PGIM, our asset management business, had strong results, reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. PGIM again exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we are particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about PGIM's prospects and are investing and expanding capabilities and distribution. 
Our Retirement and Individual Annuities businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on 2 significant U.K. longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy, but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth business and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform. 
I would also highlight that Retirement earnings, again, reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience of the PRT block has well exceeded our expectations. 
Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this will fluctuate on a quarterly basis and the longer-term mortality trend has been very good. 
Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. 
Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time, a clearer line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions. As a result of the substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty of cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future. And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. 
And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in our share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or ANPR, that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities, and the NPR, focused on corporate governance risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Starting on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from a year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment. The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from Corporate and Other operations driven by negative fluctuations and expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable international insurance revenue seasonality. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further. 
Turning to Slide 3. This year's annual actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pretax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI, totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our Annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience. While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. 
The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by a recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the universal life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecasts at the time of the Hartford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for costs of our $500 million debt tender offer in June. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million and divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pretax losses of $68 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on Annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits, which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters and about half the level of the first quarter. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets for ROA. ROA was modestly below 100 basis point range of the past few quarters. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year, reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we are externally reinsuring about half of the living benefit guarantee on new business related to the highest daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantee. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago, which included 3 significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including about $2 billion from 2 new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $500 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by asset management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive third-party flows in the quarter, with contributions from institutional and retail businesses, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year-ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in individual insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase, reflecting current quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91%, with current quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past 4 quarters. 
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including cost supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline. 
Turning to Slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure. The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations, driven by real estate sale within an investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million. 
Turning to Slide 16. International insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise more than half of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset and liability management for our in force business. We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions, and in some cases, sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan, while adapting the product portfolio, reflects the skills of our Life Planners and life consultants in matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. 
Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago, including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with a year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales. 
Turning to Slide 17. The Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a charge of about $40 million from the decline in value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method; higher expenses, including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs, all of which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of a substantial portion of our in force annuity business. As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC or Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength. Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 19. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows, including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders, including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt, including $500 million under our tender offer in June. 
Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. 
Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter. While we evaluate shareholder distributions with the board in every quarter, we expect to move the routine dividend evaluation process to the first quarter in order to better align with our capital planning cycle.

Our life to date settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to completely offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77. Specifically to your question, we have had periods in the past where the yen -- where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international business as those settled. They are staged over time, and so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis -- or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen. And therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes on the settlement of the hedges.

So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star/Edison, they were about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done in both independent agency and the LC channels, we reduced the number of relationships, focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit with the bank partners that we chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners that currently offer our products and we sell through about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter. There are 3 points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've seconded to the banks. And they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service. We don't compete via spreadsheets. The second is that we focus on Death Protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins obviously. And the other point here is that the -- we have a very high proportion of recurring premium insurance products as opposed to just savings products. So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums. And that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the bank's mentality, at least our partner's mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold. And the third is that the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are repriced twice a month for new business. And they all have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now, we really sell only U.S. dollar products because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell and the resulting profitability of the business."

So let me take this -- take a couple of minutes on how we think about asset management because I think our view on this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and of our circumstances. So for us, asset management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our client and ourselves. By that, what I mean is it's not holding in which we have a passive ownership stake, as some do, and nor is it a department that's serving one client. What it is, is a business and it's a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And it's market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain top-flight investment talent, which in turn produces consistent investment results that are very favorable. At this point, it's got over $1 trillion in AUM. As we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets. And actually, in terms of asset management fees, almost 80 -- roughly 80% of them are derived from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business, but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind, we have more fixed income assets than we have equity. So we sort of benefit from that phase of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor and benefit -- as well as beneficiary of its interrelationship with other parts of PRU. And you see that manifested in a lot of ways, which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas, whether it's PRT, in the role that asset management plays there, or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan, or the role that private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us, it's very distinctive. In relation to others, it's not a holding in which we have a passive stake. It's not a department. It's a hybrid. And it's doing very, very well. Doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well."

You referenced equity outflows in the industry, and we've seen that as well. In our case, it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S.-style-box strategies. I want to point out, however, that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total PGIM AUM. Nonetheless, we're addressing that on 2 levels. First, within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend. Among those, I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation, but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen. Second and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows. And it continues to give us confidence in our prospects going forward."

But I'd say that we look at this, Suneet, on both a tactical and a strategic level. First of all, on a tactical level, we'll continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I say, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis. But on a more strategic basis, I think it's going to be very much a story of product diversification, including getting more and more into areas of streamlined and simplified product design. I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the Annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch 2 years ago, only 2 years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter, half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance. So that type of success in diversification up to this point gives us, as I say, a lot of confidence in believing that we can take that further in product design along the lines that I mentioned."

I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduced volatility, which directly led to last evening's announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016. In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob. 
We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefit from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are, therefore, able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties. At the same time, we are also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone. 
Now specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse affect on adjusted operating income. This is largely due to a change we took in our Individual Life business related to a recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail. 
If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis for the quarter at just over 13% was also consistent with our longer-term target. 
In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower, and in some cases, negative interest rate environment. 
Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses. Our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant-currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter. This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and our distribution strength. 
Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. PGIM, our asset management business, had strong results, reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. PGIM again exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we are particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about PGIM's prospects and are investing and expanding capabilities and distribution. 
Our Retirement and Individual Annuities businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on 2 significant U.K. longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy, but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth business and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform. 
I would also highlight that Retirement earnings, again, reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience of the PRT block has well exceeded our expectations. 
Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this will fluctuate on a quarterly basis and the longer-term mortality trend has been very good. 
Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. 
Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time, a clearer line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions. As a result of the substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty of cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future. And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. 
And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in our share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or ANPR, that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities, and the NPR, focused on corporate governance risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Starting on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from a year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment. The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from Corporate and Other operations driven by negative fluctuations and expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable international insurance revenue seasonality. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further. 
Turning to Slide 3. This year's annual actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pretax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI, totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our Annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience. While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. 
The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by a recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the universal life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecasts at the time of the Hartford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for costs of our $500 million debt tender offer in June. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million and divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pretax losses of $68 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on Annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits, which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters and about half the level of the first quarter. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets for ROA. ROA was modestly below the low 100 basis point range of the past few quarters. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year, reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we are externally reinsuring about half of the living benefit guarantee on new business related to the highest daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantee. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago, which included 3 significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including about $2 billion from 2 new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $500 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by asset management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive third-party flows in the quarter, with contributions from institutional and retail businesses, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year-ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in individual insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase, reflecting current quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91%, with current quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past 4 quarters. 
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including cost supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline. 
Turning to Slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure. The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations, driven by real estate sale within an investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million. 
Turning to Slide 16. International insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise more than half of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset and liability management for our in force business. We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions, and in some cases, sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan, while adapting the product portfolio, reflects the skills of our Life Planners and life consultants in matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. 
Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago, including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with a year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales. 
Turning to Slide 17. The Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a charge of about $40 million from the decline in value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method; higher expenses, including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs, all of which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of a substantial portion of our in force annuity business. As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC or Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength. Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 19. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows, including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders, including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt, including $500 million under our tender offer in June. 
Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. 
Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter. While we evaluate shareholder distributions with the board in every quarter, we expect to move the routine dividend evaluation process to the first quarter in order to better align with our capital planning cycle. 
Now I'll turn it back over to John."

It's protecting our ROE regardless of the direction of the yen. Our life to date settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to completely offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77. Specifically to your question, we have had periods in the past where the yen -- where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international business as those settled. They are staged over time, and so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis -- or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen. And therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes on the settlement of the hedges. So we sort of think of it as there could be on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis a little bit of cash mismatch. But overall, these things will settle out."

So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star/Edison, they were about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done in both independent agency and the LC channels, we reduced the number of relationships, focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit with the bank partners that we chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners that currently offer our products and we sell through about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter. There are 3 points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've seconded to the banks. And they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service. We don't compete via spreadsheets. The second is that we focus on Death Protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins obviously. And the other point here is that the -- we have a very high proportion of recurring premium insurance products as opposed to just savings products. So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums. And that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the bank's mentality, at least our partner's mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold. And the third is that the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are repriced twice a month for new business. And they all have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now, we really sell only U.S. dollar products because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about.

First, it's important to point out that we've had a significant reduction in our interest rate sensitivity post the completion of the VA captive initiative.

It's driven by the fact that, as I indicated earlier, we've migrated over to a more stable statutory framework and it reflects the long-term nature of the risks. Importantly, we eliminated the internal corporate hedge -- under hedge, excuse me, as I indicated in my opening comments. And we're managing all of the VA risks within those same legal entities. I also note that we manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our AA targets through cyclical stress scenarios.

You saw that in what we called the risk margin, which was the Delta between the GAAP liability and hedge target before. And you will continue to see that volatility between the full GAAP liability and our economic target of that liability. So that has not gone away from us having -- or for us. Having said that, we expect to manage the outcome in a way that helps to mitigate that reported volatility going forward.

So let me take this -- take a couple of minutes on how we think about asset management because I think our view on this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and of our circumstances. So for us, asset management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our clients and ourselves. By that, what I mean is it's not holding in which we have a passive ownership stake, as some do, and nor is it a department that's serving one client. What it is, is a business and it's a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And it's market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain top-flight investment talent, which in turn produces consistent investment results that are very favorable. At this point, it's got over $1 trillion in AUM. As we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets. And actually, in terms of asset management fees, almost 80 -- roughly 80% of them are derived from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business, but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind, we have more fixed income assets than we have equity. So we sort of benefit from that phase of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor and benefit -- as well as beneficiary of its interrelationship with other parts of PRU. And you see that manifested in a lot of ways, which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas, whether it's PRT, in the role that asset management plays there, or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan, or the role that private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us, it's very distinctive. In relation to others, it's not a holding in which we have a passive stake. It's not a department. It's a hybrid. And it's doing very, very well. Doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well."

You referenced equity outflows in the industry, and we've seen that as well. In our case, it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S.-style-box strategies. I want to point out, however, that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total PGIM AUM. Nonetheless, we're addressing that on 2 levels. First, within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend. Among those, I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation, but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen. Second and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows.

First of all, we very much want to make sure at all times in the Annuities business, that we're operating it on a sustainable basis. So while, obviously, we seek to be competitive, we also want to make sure that we're maintaining pricing discipline. In PDI, for example, we've recently announced a 25 basis point decrease in both the roll-up rate and the payout rate. And we think that's appropriate under the circumstances. But I'd say that we look at this, Suneet, on both a tactical and a strategic level. First of all, on a tactical level, we'll continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I say, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis. But on a more strategic basis, I think it's going to be very much a story of product diversification, including getting more and more into areas of streamlined and simplified product design. I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the Annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch 2 years ago, only 2 years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter, half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance. So that type of success in diversification up to this point gives us, as I say, a lot of confidence in believing that we can take that further in product design along the lines that I mentioned."

I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduced volatility, which directly led to last evening's announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016. In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob. 
We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefit from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are, therefore, able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties. At the same time, we are also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone. 
Now specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse effect on adjusted operating income. This is largely due to a change we took in our Individual Life business related to a recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail. 
If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis for the quarter at just over 13% was also consistent with our longer-term target. 
In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower, and in some cases, negative interest rate environment. 
Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses. Our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant-currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter. This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and our distribution strength. 
Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. PGIM, our asset management business, had strong results, reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. PGIM again exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we are particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about PGIM's prospects and are investing and expanding capabilities and distribution. 
Our Retirement and Individual Annuities businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on 2 significant U.K. longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy, but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth business and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform. 
I would also highlight that Retirement earnings, again, reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience of the PRT block has well exceeded our expectations. 
Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this will fluctuate on a quarterly basis and the longer-term mortality trend has been very good. 
Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. 
Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time, a clearer line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions. As a result of the substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty of cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future. And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. 
And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in our share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or ANPR, that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities, and the NPR, focused on corporate governance risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Starting on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from a year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment. The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from Corporate and Other operations driven by negative fluctuations and expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these 2 items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. 
Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable international insurance revenue seasonality. 
On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further. 
Turning to Slide 3. This year's annual actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pretax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI, totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our Annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience. While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. 
The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by a recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the universal life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecasts at the time of the Hartford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for costs of our $500 million debt tender offer in June. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million and divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pretax losses of $68 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on Annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits, which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters and about half the level of the first quarter. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets for ROA. ROA was modestly below the low 100 basis point range of the past few quarters. 
Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year, reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we are externally reinsuring about half of the living benefit guarantee on new business related to the highest daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than 1/3 of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantee. 
Turning to Slide 8. Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago, which included 3 significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including about $2 billion from 2 new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $500 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. Asset management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by asset management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive third-party flows in the quarter, with contributions from institutional and retail businesses, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year-ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in individual insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 12. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase, reflecting current quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. 
Turning to Slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91%, with current quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past 4 quarters. 
Moving to international insurance and turning to Slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including cost supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline. 
Turning to Slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure. The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations, driven by real estate sale within an investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million. 
Turning to Slide 16. International insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise more than half of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly 1/3 of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset and liability management for our in force business. We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions, and in some cases, sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan, while adapting the product portfolio, reflects the skills of our Life Planners and life consultants in matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. 
Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago, including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with a year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales. 
Turning to Slide 17. The Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are: lower investment income, reflecting a charge of about $40 million from the decline in value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method; higher expenses, including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs, all of which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of a substantial portion of our in force annuity business. As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC or Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength. Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 19. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows, including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders, including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt, including $500 million under our tender offer in June. 
Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. 
Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter.

It's protecting our ROE regardless of the direction of the yen. Our life to date settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to completely offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77. Specifically to your question, we have had periods in the past where the yen -- where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international business as those settled. They are staged over time, and so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis -- or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen. And therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes on the settlement of the hedges. So we sort of think of it as there could be on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis a little bit of cash mismatch. But overall, these things will settle out."

So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star/Edison, they were about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done in both independent agency and the LC channels, we reduced the number of relationships, focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit with the bank partners that we chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners that currently offer our products and we sell through about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter. There are 3 points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've seconded to the banks. And they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service. We don't compete via spreadsheets. The second is that we focus on Death Protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins obviously. And the other point here is that the -- we have a very high proportion of recurring premium insurance products as opposed to just savings products. So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums. And that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the bank's mentality, at least our partner's mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold. And the third is that the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are repriced twice a month for new business. And they all have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now we really sell only U.S. dollar products because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell and the resulting profitability of the business."

First, it's important to point out that we've had a significant reduction in our interest rate sensitivity post the completion of the VA captive initiative.

It's driven by the fact that, as I indicated earlier, we've migrated over to a more stable statutory framework and it reflects the long-term nature of the risks. Importantly, we eliminated the internal corporate hedge -- under hedge, excuse me, as I indicated in my opening comments. And we're managing all of the VA risks within those same legal entities. I also note that we manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our AA targets through cyclical stress scenarios.

And the way in which the statutory construct worked in the past was such that the primary shortcoming of it was such that the use of derivatives, which we thought was important to manage this risk, was not fully incorporated or adequately incorporated into that construct. And where the statutory construct is migrating toward is one which gives a much fuller and robust recognition of derivatives, both their use, their admission, modeling of the derivatives and the accounting for the derivatives. And that was really the primary reason why we went to captive and the motivation for being able to recapture from the captive. There are economic benefits in the recapture that I described before that led to, as you noted, the reduced volatility and the free up of capital. So all things being equal, we'd rather manage this thing holistically. It was the shortcomings of the construct before that prevented us from doing so."

So both from a capital standpoint in terms of how the calculation works and then from our ability to then manage the risk, and then you lay on top of that the statutory construct being one that is more stable, less volatile, all 3 of those combined to the reduced volatility that you're seeing and will see going forward and the free-up of the capital."

We've seen that in the past, and we expect we'll continue see that. If you look at our results, however, a large portion of this was due to the ""Corporate under hedge"" of the interest rate risk, which has now been eliminated. There is a residual misaligned between statutory or -- statutory and economic view of the liability and how it gets expressed in GAAP. You saw that in what we called the risk margin, which was the Delta between the GAAP liability and hedge target before. And you will continue to see that volatility between the full GAAP liability and our economic target of that liability. So that has not gone away from us having -- or for us. Having said that, we expect to manage the outcome in a way that helps to mitigate that reported volatility going forward. The other thing I think is important to highlight is that, as I mentioned earlier, the Annuities business going forward, we think, in addition to the stability coming out of it, is going to be a source of strong cash flow for the 2 reasons that I highlighted.

So let me take this -- take a couple of minutes on how we think about asset management because I think our view on this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and of our circumstances. So for us, asset management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our clients and ourselves. By that, what I mean is it's not holding in which we have a passive ownership stake, as some do, and nor is it a department that's serving one client. What it is, is a business and it's a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And it's market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain top-flight investment talent, which in turn produces consistent investment results that are very favorable. At this point, it's got over $1 trillion in AUM. As we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets. And actually, in terms of asset management fees, almost 80 -- roughly 80% of them are derived from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business, but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind, we have more fixed income assets than we have equity. So we sort of benefit from that phase of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor and benefit -- as well as beneficiary of its interrelationship with other parts of PRU. And you see that manifested in a lot of ways, which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas, whether it's PRT, in the role that asset management plays there, or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan, or the role that private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us, it's very distinctive. In relation to others, it's not a holding in which we have a passive stake. It's not a department. It's a hybrid. And it's doing very, very well. Doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well."

You referenced equity outflows in the industry, and we've seen that as well. In our case, it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S.-style-box strategies. I want to point out, however, that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total PGIM AUM. Nonetheless, we're addressing that on 2 levels. First, within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend. Among those, I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation, but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen. Second and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows. And it continues to give us confidence in our prospects going forward."

First of all, on a tactical level, we'll continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I say, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis. But on a more strategic basis, I think it's going to be very much a story of product diversification, including getting more and more into areas of streamlined and simplified product design. I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the Annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch 2 years ago, only 2 years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter, half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of hi",1035,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of high-quality businesses that fit well together. The balance of our businesses and risks enables us to produce strong overall earnings and also helps weather the normal variability that can occur across segments in any given quarter. 
Operating earnings per share for the quarter at 2 51, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was consistent with our internal expectations and the 2 52 that we produced in the third quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity through 9 months was healthy at about 13%. And book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew 9% over the prior year. 
While our overall results were solid and we saw good core growth across many of our businesses, there were a number of factors that influenced the quarter. On the positive side, we reported strong investment results, benefiting from non-coupon investment returns that exceeded our average expectations. While results in this asset class do show variability, we are pleased to see the balance back in returns following weaker results in the first half of the year. 
Our Annuities business also benefited from a more efficient approach to managing risk that positively impacted margins, which should have an element of sustainability going forward. 
On the other hand, our overall underwriting experience was less favorable than our average expectations, and this can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In addition, expenses were elevated in the quarter. Mark will discuss this in more detail, but we experienced a higher-than-usual level of charges and expenses of items that are inherently variable. 
I'll now make some high-level observations on the fundamentals in our businesses, starting with our international operations. We reported solid core growth and favorable underwriting margins at our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Foreign exchange and higher-than-typical expenses adversely impacted earnings comparisons to the prior year. But otherwise, the segment produced steady, mid-single-digit core growth. Constant currency sales increased 8% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by significant increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan. 
While interest rates remain a significant challenge in Japan, we're pleased with the pricing and product actions that we have taken on yen products, and the current quarter results continue to show the benefit of our well-established distribution strength, including for U.S. dollar products. 
Our U.S. businesses also produced overall good results, though with some moving parts. At PGIM, our asset management business, we are pleased with the growth in our quarterly [ph] earnings and assets under management. We reported another strong quarter for net flows, which contributed to PGIM's $1.1 trillion at total AUM at September 30, including over $500 billion with unaffiliated institutional and retail third-party accounts. 
And notably, we believe we are also starting to see the payback on our initiative spending in PGIM, with over $15 billion of net flows since the beginning of 2015 that are directly tied to recent strategic initiatives. 
Our Retirement business also had another good quarter, generating solid earnings and showing positive growth trends. Strong net flows in the quarter were mainly driven by our pension risk transfer business, which closed on several transactions, including one notable sale in the quarter of $2.5 billion. Although transaction activity in the PRT business is lumpy, this remains a highly attractive business in an area where we are a clear industry leader. 
Earnings and margins in our Individual Annuities business were very good. However, we continue to see some sales pressures. There are distribution uncertainties associated with the Department of Labor regulations, and the low interest rate environment influences product attractiveness. That said, our product diversification efforts had enabled us to mitigate downward sales pressures and improve our risk profile. 
In addition, actions we have taken to manage our annuity risk more efficiency enhance our confidence that Individual Annuities will represent a strong source of earnings and cash flows, with lower volatility and greater transparency going forward. 
Our U.S. protection results were mixed. Group Insurance continues to produce very good underwriting margins that benefit ratio in the quarter at the low end of our expected range. However, Individual Life insurance reported results well below our expectations due to adverse mortality and higher-than-typical charges. While we were disappointed by these results for the quarter and for the first 9 months, claim experience can fluctuate over the shorter time frames, and our overall mortality experience has been positive in aggregate over the last several years. 
I will now make some quick observations on capital deployment and regulation. We returned about $930 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Balancing capital deployment between shareholder return and strategic initiatives, while maintaining a strong capital position remains a key priority. Share repurchases in the quarter as well as our remaining authorization for 2016 include amounts related to the capital that was freed up from our variable annuity restructuring. Nonetheless, we continue to expect about 60% of our earnings over time to be available for shareholder returns and other accretive actions. 
And on the regulatory front, we recently issued comment letters to the Fed reserve in response to proposals for capital requirements as well as for corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. This continues to be an iterative process with a long way to go, but we remain encouraged by the efforts of the Fed to put into place an appropriate set of standards for insurance entities. 
In conclusion, we remain positive on our prospects and ability to generate differentiated returns and strong cash flows in an evolving and challenging environment. We continue to invest in our businesses with initiatives that have both short-term and longer-term payback periods. A good portion of these expenses are financed through efficiency gains that we've been able to achieve across our operations. But ultimately, our investments in products, distribution and technology, including how we engage with customers, will enable us to continue to succeed and capitalize on growth opportunities over the long time frames. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. Special thanks to those of you in Chicago, who are participating in our earlier-than-usual call this morning. I'll take you through our results,",2320,"Excuse me. Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. Special thanks to those of you in Chicago, who are participating in our earlier-than-usual call this morning. 
I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights, and I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.66 per share for the quarter compared to $2.40 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses remained solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our asset management and Annuities businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, earnings per share was essentially flat compared to a year ago as the year-over-year comparison was affected by fluctuations and a few inherently variable items. 
I'll mention a few highlights. First, higher current quarter net expenses within our Corporate and Other results and in several businesses, largely driven by higher-than-typical charges for items such as employee benefit and compensation plans and legal costs; second, less favorable underwriting experience compared to a contribution more favorable than our average expectations a year ago; and third, more favorable net investment results, with current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees above our average expectations. The items I mentioned, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a net negative impact of roughly $0.30 per share on the comparison of our results to a year ago. 
The net impact of current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations contributed about $0.05 per share to earnings related to favorable non-coupon investment income, prepayment fees and net adverse claims experienced across businesses, together with reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs in Individual Life. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $7.22 for the first 9 months of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. 
In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, a number of our businesses have had higher-than-average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the seasonal impact of items such as annual policyholder communications and onboarding as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. 
Looking back over the past 3 years, this pattern has produced, on average, about $125 million to $175 million higher expenses in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the full year. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.8 billion for the current quarter, about $600 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by favorable results from product derivatives and hedging. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Market-driven and discrete items for the quarter include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in customer accounts and also included charges for legal costs in Retirement, driven by cases, we believe, are nearing -- are approaching conclusion. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our GAAP net income of $1.8 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pretax net realized investment gains of $649 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pretax gains of $125 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives in hedging had a positive impact of $553 million, mainly driven by GAAP-embedded derivatives and related items for annuities living benefits. 
Impairments in credit losses of $40 million were the lowest of the past 5 quarters. The gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from our international operations and is largely driven by currency-related gains. The current quarter income from divested businesses mainly reflect results from long-term care and the Closed Block. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 5. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $35 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by a more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations as well as a favorable true-up. In addition, results benefited from a greater net contribution from policy charges and fees due to the refinements we recently implemented in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as higher account values. We estimate that our changes in risk management strategy contributed just under 5 points to return on assets or ROA, for the quarter, with a little over 5 additional points from favorable investment returns relative to average expectations and from the true-up in the quarter. 
Keep in mind that quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline, and results for this quarter were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. 
Slide 6 resents our annuity sales. While total sales are essentially unchanged from a year ago, you can see the impact of our diversification strategy in the current quarter mix. Nearly 3 quarters of annuity sales comes without retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product were $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong market demand, along with our successful diversification efforts. The $400 million increase in PDI sales from a year ago offset lower sales of our highest daily, or HD, product. 
Turning to Slide 7. Retirement earnings were $273 million for the quarter, up by $51 million from a year ago. The increase reflects the $75 million greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $55 million above our average expectation. This compares to non-coupon investment returns about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. 
A lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter, including reserve strengthening in a legacy case, was a partial offset. I would note that the pattern of case experience can fluctuate from 1 quarter to another, and we've benefited from about $100 million of favorable case experience since the beginning of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $12.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $11.5 billion a year ago, which included a $4.7 billion major case win in Full Service. Gross sales of Institutional Investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $7 billion, with roughly $4 billion of new pension risk transfer cases, including about $3 billion of funded business and $1 billion of longevity reinsurance. In addition, stable value wraps contributed about $2 billion to current quarter sales. 
Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $5 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9. Asset management earnings were $191 million for the quarter compared to $180 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partly offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter and a $6 million lower contribution from other related revenues. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees for management of fixed income assets, driven by growth in assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate, partly offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $4.3 billion of net positive, unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from institutional and retail business, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 10. Individual Life earnings were $111 million for the quarter, down $72 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience, with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $30 million below our average expectations, including a negative impact of about $10 million from related reserve updates and amortization. This compares to a strong year-ago quarter when the contribution to earnings from claims experience was about $25 million more favorable than average expectations. 
In addition, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $20 million from reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs. These items were partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees of about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. In addition, guaranteed Universal Life sales were down from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases earlier this year. We recently announced further price increases and face amount limits through these products to help maintain appropriate returns and meet our targets for new business diversification. 
Turning to Slide 12. Group Insurance earnings were $62 million for the quarter, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million more than favorable -- more favorable than our average expectations. More favorable underwriting results also contributed to the increase. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the favorable and of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 13. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $391 million for the quarter compared to $398 million a year ago. Excluding a $23 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, a more favorable surrender experience and a greater contribution from net investment results, including earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which was slightly above our average expectations. Less favorable claims experience and higher expenses were partial offsets. 
While the current quarter contribution to results from claims experience was below the level of a year ago, it was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14. Gibraltar Life earnings were $389 million for the quarter compared to $414 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $30 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile. We also had more favorable claims experience, with a contribution to earnings about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation. These benefits were largely offset by about $25 million of higher expenses, driven largely by nonlinear items, including benefit plan true-ups and office move costs in the current quarter. The current quarter contribution to earnings from net investment results was largely in line with a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees slightly less favorable than our average expectations. 
Before leaving international results, I will note that we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2017, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 112 per U.S. dollar. 
Turning to Slide 15. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $771 million for the current quarter, up by $55 million or 8% from year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 63% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise nearly 60% of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to about 40% of sales a year ago. This change in mix reflects the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment and also reflects actions we've taken for yen products that are most affected by interest rates, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sales suspensions. These are generally products with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. 
While we are seeing competitors in Japan expand their efforts to sell U.S. dollar products in response to low or negative interest rates on yen-based investments, we continue to benefit from solid competitive advantages in the distribution of these products. And our long-standing focus on recurring premium death protection policies, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins. 
Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 9% increase in agent count, driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments, together with higher productivity and average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up 6% from a year ago. This reflected a 13% sales increase from our life consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size, together with an increase in agent count. Third-party channel sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Sales outside Japan are up 4% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. 
Turning to Slide 16. The Corporate and Other loss was $413 million for the current quarter compared to a $308 million loss a year ago. Corporate and Other results include a number of items that are inherently variable. Net expenses were about $90 million above the year-ago quarter, with the majority of the increase driven by employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are mostly remeasured each quarter based on equity markets or share prices. The current quarter increases in Prudential stock and in the broader S&P 500 compared to meaningful declines a year ago, contributed to a significant change in the impact of these plans on results. Higher current quarter costs for items such as business development and consulting and a $20 million benefit to the year-ago quarter from a reinsurance settlement also contributed to the year-over-year increase. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 17. Following the recapture of living benefit risks from our reinsurance captive earlier this year, most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts and the supporting capital are now resident in a single statutory entity we call ALEC, which was a direct writer of many of the contracts. As a result, we now view composite RBC, including our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a primary measure of our financial strength in relation to our benchmarks. On that basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the third quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 840% and 987%, respectively, as of June 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
I'll turn now to an update on the risk management refinements we implemented during the third quarter as part of the strategy to manage all our annuities product risks together with the Annuities business. We continue to manage these risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios. With the current structure, we are now managing the risks with a combination of traditional fixed income investments and derivatives held within our statutory entities. These strategy refinements are beginning to produce earnings benefits, as Mark mentioned, and are simplifying our annuities operation, reducing our capital volatility and increasing the certainty of cash flows from the business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 18. Cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, a decrease of about $500 million from June 30. This reflects the impact of the return of about $930 million to shareholders, including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases net of cash inflows during the quarter. Our financial and total leverage ratios at September 30 remained within our targets. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we expect to move the evaluation of our dividend level to the first quarter of 2017 in order to get better aligned with our capital planning cycle. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And actually in talking about the annuities piece, it's a good story. So I'm actually going to spend a minute on it, if you don't mind. So recall that we completed this in 3 phases. The first at the end of last year, where we got regulatory approval for the statutory framework that we were undertaking. The second phase completed in the second quarter, where we actually recaptured the living benefit rider. And then what you've seen this quarter is that we migrated over to our new risk management strategy, and that strategy is what gave rise to the earnings enhancement that you asked about. The outcomes of those 3 phases have been that first, we reorganized and simplified the legal entity structure that supports our Annuities business. We're managing all the risks associated with that business within the annuities legal entities now, meaning that the internal corporate under hedge, which was a prior contributor to earnings, capital and leverage volatility, is no longer in existence. And we're using a more stable statutory framework that reflects the long-term nature of the risks, and we've talked about that before. And as I noted in my remarks, we're using a combination of derivatives and financial assets to fully diffuse that liability. The immediate results that you've seen have been a reduced capital sensitivity to market movements. You saw that particularly in the first and second quarters, a release of about $1 billion, which we talked about last quarter. That was the basis for the $0.5 billion increase in the share repurchases that we undertook or that were authorized, a portion of which we executed on during the course of this quarter. And those lower risks that gave rise that release in capital are leading to lower costs actually then manage the risks. So that resulted in an increase in AOI, about $15 million in the quarter, but we think the run rate number is more like about $20 million. I'd also give rise to what you saw below outside of AOI and the positive unlocking that increased net income for the quarter as well."

I'll address the rest of your question. First of all, the annuities and the ROA. As Mark mentioned, 114 basis points is certainly driven in part by some favorable nonrecurring items and some investment lift this quarter. However, the risk management strategy, as Robert just mentioned, it does create some sustainable run rate benefit. And Mark mentioned that at about 4 to 5 basis points. So while we'd still say that the average expectation for ROA in this business is about -- between 100 and 105 basis points, it'd be fair to say that the new risk management strategy creates some degree of bias towards the upper part of that range. In regard to what you asked about, the retirement and the case experience, as Mark mentioned, that was adverse by about $20 million. However, half of that relates to reserve strengthening on a legacy block of business of word. If you look at the pension risk transfer business itself, case experience was very modestly below average expectations in this quarter. But the same cases that result in modest adverse experience this quarter have been cumulatively $100 million positive over the last 7 quarters. So results are going to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but all evidence continues to be that this is a very solid and very well-priced book of business."

Let me answer with the end question, and then maybe I'll tack back to just further reflections on that. From a seasonality standpoint, we think that the range that we've provided of, call it, $125 million to $175 million in the fourth quarter relative to the average of all 4 quarters is a trend that will persist. And so we expect to see that this year as well. You saw it in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was at the lower end of that range. And in the fourth quarter of 2015, it was the upper end of that range. Now we think about that against what sort of the adjusted level of expenses. And so in Mark's opening comments, he called out the $90 million of higher than what we would consider to be or nonlinear elevated expenses relative to what we would consider to be more normal. About half that was in the businesses, and we called out the -- some of the causes of that. The other half of it was in Corporate and Other, and we also identified the causes there. If you look at the higher level of expenses and you look at our Corporate and Other, a lot of it is attributable to that word an unusually high level this quarter. And so if you kind of reflect on a more adjusted level for that, think about last quarter, we had 1 or 2 onetime charges that we adjusted for. We had an equity method investment that we wrote down and with some costs associated with the tender offer. We tendered for about $0.5 billion worth of debt. That brought that the adjusted number down to $335 million last quarter. If you look at the trailing 4 quarters, so not quite the question you asked about sort of year-to-date. But if you look at this quarter and go back 3, the average for those of 4 quarters is around $350 million on an adjusted basis using what we've called that this quarter and last quarter. So I would think about that at sort of being indicative of a more normalized number, more kind of an adjusted number that we would more typically see. And that gives you a sense for then what you would extrapolate against looking into the fourth quarter for measuring the variance against the first 3."

There have been some continuing albeit smaller demonstrations in Chile around it. A couple of issues new issue involved as well. But the first issue revolves around the fact that people are perceived their pensions to be low. And to solve this issue, Chile must go back to a defined benefit system. In other words, they'd like the government to fund higher pensions and to guarantee those pensions. So that's the first issue. The second issue that has arisen revolves around the pushback on the investment structure used by a couple of foreign companies in their AFP purchases. So with regard to the first issue, the government has said they have no money to fund pensions, but they have suggested that corporations pay an additional 5% into the pension system. And President has also suggested perhaps creating a government AFP in addition to the existing AFPs. So with regard to this issue, the situation remains fluid and probably will stay that way for some time as the government sorts out what they'll do. And we think that's going to be in the first half of next year. But there are some suggestions on the table and we'll see what happens. Now in terms of Habitat, I'd like to make a couple of observations. First it's the #2 pension administrator with about a 26% market share. But we think that there are 4 key attributes of the company that are really important. First is that it focuses relentlessly on costs. In fact, it's the most efficient AFP and has the lowest fee of any of the 4 largest players, and that's really important given the context of what's going on. Secondly, it has exceptional fund performance, both on a relative and absolute basis, and that's also really important as people focus on what they're getting for their investments. Third, they have very high-quality service, and fourth, they are leading player in the voluntary pension products. In terms of the second issue, we acquired the company with a different structure than others and not amortizing any of the intangibles. And you may recall that it took an awfully long time to gain regulatory approval, in large part, due to frankly, welcome scrutiny of our structure to make sure that all that regulatory requirements. So from our point of view, we want to make sure the the agreement not only met the letter, but the spirit of the law. And that's why we welcome the regulatory scrutiny in order to make sure that the regulators who were very comfortable with the structure that we had. So we're monitoring the situation closely, but feel as a company, Habitat's in a really good position within the industry."

The -- when you managed that way, the actual RBC calculation can get kind of funny on you.

First, the -- when we took the writer, when we put it together back with the host, you have a decrease in risk by virtue of doing that because you have offsetting risks that you now are able to manage within the same legal entity. So if you think about our economic liability, it has actually declined by almost $1 billion by virtue of having been able to pull those 2 entities together. So that's you're hedging less risk piece of it because you've got less risk manifesting as a result of the combination of those 2 entities. The other part of it is that the way in which we're hedging using a combination of financial instruments, fixed income instruments and derivatives is a more efficient way for us to hedge. So the very point that you made. When we're using derivatives -- I don't want to get overly technical on this, but you're using the swap curve. Swap curves is negative to treasuries. When you're using fixed income instruments, we're actually getting the full benefit of the yield associated with treasuries. We're buying a lot of treasuries for that liabilities. You're actually getting a better yield on that. So it's a combination of we have less risk and, therefore, need to hedge less. And we're using a hedged strategy, which is more efficient. And that results in the combination of those 2 things results in lower costs to manage the risk. That means we have higher estimated gross profits in the future."

And it's too early and I wouldn't want to either anticipate or speak for the Fed, but we think we've made constructive recommendations that will be carefully considered. With respect to the capital framework, I think that the tone of everything, both orally and in writing, has been very much in the direction of trying to get it right for insurance companies, whether in the context of more of a bottoms-up statutory-based framework, which is reflected in the building block approach or the items that we expect will be appropriately considered in the GAAP-driven consolidated approach. So I think you have to separate the capital question into 2 parts. One is the framework and the way in which that works and particularly, how it deals with things like marking to market either side of the balance sheet and how that's done, things like margin and reserves, things like separate accounts. So there's a list of framework issues. And then separate from that, there's the question of calibration. And you heard part of our story around variable annuities and how well protected we are between reserves and capital. And you can extrapolate many of those themes to the entire company, and that's kind of what's behind my sort of chronic comment that we believe that we should be able to meet any reasonable capital standards that are set. So working through the framework, I would say that the tone of everything is very much in the direction of being appropriate for insurance. With respect to calibration, it remains to be seen. But again, we are extraordinarily strong considering the overall loss absorption capacity of the company."

I don't think we don't want to provide granular a sort of a level of visibility. There are a number of things that go into that. We identified the things that would account for the larger portion of the amount that we provided to you. But since the topics come up again, let me just take maybe an extra minutes on expenses because I know it's -- given that it's been raised it's an area of interest. As a firm, we pay a lot of attention to costs. We've been really disciplined about growing our costs over time. If you look back as a -- over the last couple of years, what you would see is that our expenses, excluding the initiatives that we've undertaken, fully grown over the last since 2015 -- actually, since 2013 have only grown around 1%. As you include the initiatives in there, then they've grown at only around 3%. And that compares to our AOI growth that's been in excess of 4%. So we've been very disciplined about costs, and therefore, you haven't seen us having to do large cutbacks in our cost structure as a result of being controlled in the way that we've grown it to begin with. But having said that, we've also been very strategic in how and where we've chosen to invest our expense dollars and those initiatives that we repeatedly refer to. It's very similar, frankly, to the approach that we took coming through the crisis. It was measured, thoughtful and disciplined, but when we see an opportunity to invest and position ourselves ahead of competition, are cutting back and going in a different direction, we're going to invest in the future into that. So if you look at initiative spending that also gives some basis for the rise in overall expenses that we have, we expect that it will generate long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth for the company. And you can see some of the benefits of that already manifesting themselves. The total gross level of initiative spending is actually much larger than what you see coming through because we're using savings that we were able to harvest from some of our early initiatives to pay for some of the initiatives that we're undertaking now. And you're also seeing some of the investments we've made in places like distribution, paying off in the form of very strong, for instance, flows in our asset management business. So we're very focused on our cost control being very strategic about we're investing. And maybe pivot over to Steve and ask if he wants to elaborate or all on some of that initiative spending and how it's actually affecting the businesses."

There are certain businesses will ever above that ratio other businesses that will be below that ratio. And that's really I like to describe it as an input, not an output. And the reason for that is we have a very high ROE as a company, and therefore, we have opportunities within our businesses to reinvest our free cash flow back into those businesses at those higher returns in order to generate growth that returns that are in excess of cost of capital. So from our standpoint, we try to balance the level of reinvestment that we're making into our businesses to target where we're producing, where we have opportunities to grow and where those opportunities to grow or sustained high ROEs. And so we could push that cash flow ratio up quite easily, but we will then start our businesses in the form of organic growth.

And the other way can drive it down much lower, but then that the cost of investing in things that would have an margin lower ROE. So it's a balance for us and the targeted number, and we're very comfortable with that 60% on a go-forward basis."

We do see across the industry that there's been some pressure on fees that will across active and passive strategies for the past few years. The DOL rule will continue to support and possibly, accelerate that trend. We are still see ourselves as being a very, very competitive in that context. While we see different types of flows in different parts of the business, certainly in our equities business, we've not been immune from the shift from active to passive. We've seen that in our equity business, particularly in the traditional U.S. style-box strategies. However, we're responding to that through investing in our growth in areas within equities that have shown greater resilience in that active-to-passive trend, global, international, income-oriented and factored-based investing in our quantitative management business. And then also, the very nature of the multi-manager business is itself. Even as we see some degree of outflows in equity like other active managers, we've seen very robust, positive flows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. We've had those positive institutional flows for 13 straight years, and that gives us confidence in our prospects. I'd also mention that if you relate kind of equities to fixed income, certainly, equity strategies, by and large, have a higher fee basis than fixed income. But because of the high margins and the particularly attractive scale economies in our fixed income business, we only need somewhat less than $1.5 of positive fixed income flows to offset the impact of a dollar of negative equity flows despite the lower fees that might be pertinent to fixed income business. So between the multi-manager strategy and our competitiveness across different asset classes, we feel ourselves are very well prepared to compete, even as we do see some secular downward on fees."

1038328,281135946,1072313,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of hi",1033,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of high-quality businesses that fit well together. The balance of our businesses and risks enables us to produce strong overall earnings and also helps weather the normal variability that can occur across segments in any given quarter. 
Operating earnings per share for the quarter at $2.51, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was consistent with our internal expectations and the $2.52 that we produced in the third quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity through 9 months was healthy at about 13%. And book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew 9% over the prior year. 
While our overall results were solid, and we saw good core growth across many of our businesses, there were a number of factors that influenced the quarter. On the positive side, we reported strong investment results, benefiting from non-coupon investment returns that exceeded our average expectations. While results in this asset class do show variability, we are pleased to see the bounce back in returns following weaker results in the first half of the year. 
Our Annuities business also benefited from a more efficient approach to managing risk that positively impacted margins, which should have an element of sustainability going forward. 
On the other hand, our overall underwriting experience was less favorable than our average expectations, and this can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In addition, expenses were elevated in the quarter. Mark will discuss this in more detail, but we experienced a higher-than-usual level of charges and expenses of items that are inherently variable. 
I'll now make some high-level observations on the fundamentals in our businesses, starting with our international operations. We reported solid core growth and favorable underwriting margins at our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Foreign exchange and higher-than-typical expenses adversely impacted earnings comparison to the prior year. But otherwise, the segment produced steady, mid-single-digit core growth. Constant currency sales increased 8% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by significant increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan. 
While interest rates remain a significant challenge in Japan, we're pleased with the pricing and product actions that we have taken on Yen products, and the current quarter results continue to show the benefit of our well-established distribution strength, including for U.S. dollar products. 
Our U.S. businesses also produced overall good results, though with some moving parts. At PGIM, our asset management business, we are pleased with the growth in our core earnings and assets under management. We reported another strong quarter for net flows, which contributed to PGIM's $1.1 trillion of total AUM at September 30, including over $500 billion with unaffiliated institutional and retail third-party accounts. 
And notably, we believe we are also starting to see the payback on our initiative spending in PGIM, with over $15 billion of net flows since the beginning of 2015 that are directly tied to recent strategic initiatives. 
Our Retirement business also had another good quarter, generating solid earnings and showing positive growth trends. Strong net flows in the quarter were mainly driven by our pension risk transfer business, which closed on several transactions, including one notable sale in the quarter of $2.5 billion. Although transaction activity in the PRT business is lumpy, this remains a highly attractive business in an area where we are a clear industry leader. 
Earnings and margins in our Individual Annuities business were very good. However, we continue to see some sales pressures. There are distribution uncertainties associated with the Department of Labor regulations, and the low interest rate environment influences product attractiveness. That said, our product diversification efforts have enabled us to mitigate downward sales pressures and improve our risk profile. 
In addition, actions we have taken to manage our annuity risk more efficiently enhance our confidence that Individual Annuities will represent a strong source of earnings and cash flows, with lower volatility and greater transparency going forward. 
Our U.S. protection results were mixed. Group Insurance continues to produce very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter at the low end of our expected range. However, Individual Life Insurance reported results well below our expectations due to adverse mortality and higher-than-typical charges. While we were disappointed by these results for the quarter and for the first 9 months, claim experience can fluctuate over the shorter time frames, and our overall mortality experience has been positive in aggregate over the last several years. 
I will now make some quick observations on capital deployment and regulation. We returned about $930 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Balancing capital deployment between shareholder return and strategic initiatives, while maintaining a strong capital position remains a key priority. Share repurchases in the quarter as well as our remaining authorization for 2016 include amounts related to the capital that was freed up from our variable annuity restructuring. Nonetheless, we continue to expect about 60% of our earnings over time to be available for shareholder returns and other accretive actions. 
And on the regulatory front, we recently issued comment letters to the Fed Reserve in response to proposals for capital requirements as well as for corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. This continues to be an iterative process with a long way to go, but we remain encouraged by the efforts of the Fed to put into place an appropriate set of standards for insurance entities. 
In conclusion, we remain positive on our prospects and ability to generate differentiated returns and strong cash flows in an evolving and challenging environment. We continue to invest in our businesses with initiatives that have both shorter and longer-term payback periods. A good portion of these expenses are financed through efficiency gains that we've been able to achieve across our operations. But ultimately, our investments in products, distribution and technology, including how we engage with customers, will enable us to continue to succeed and capitalize on growth opportunities over the long time frames. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Special thanks to those of you in Chicago, who are participating in our earlier-than-usual call this morning. 
I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights, and I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.66 per share for the quarter compared to $2.40 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses remained solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our Asset Management and Annuities businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, earnings per share was essentially flat compared to a year ago as the year-over-year comparison was affected by fluctuations in a few inherently variable items. 
I'll mention a few highlights. First, higher current quarter net expenses within our Corporate and Other results and in several businesses, largely driven by higher-than-typical charges for items such as employee benefit and compensation plans and legal costs; second, less favorable underwriting experience compared to a contribution more favorable than our average expectations a year ago; and third, more favorable net investment results, with current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees above our average expectations. The items I mentioned, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a net negative impact of roughly $0.30 per share on the comparison of our results to a year ago. 
The net impact of current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations contributed about $0.05 per share to earnings related to favorable non-coupon investment income, prepayment fees and net adverse claims experienced across businesses, together with reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs in Individual Life. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $7.22 for the first 9 months of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. 
In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, a number of our businesses have had higher-than-average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the seasonal impact of items such as annual policyholder communications and onboarding as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. 
Looking back over the past 3 years, this pattern has produced, on average, about $125 million to $175 million higher expenses in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the full year. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.8 billion for the current quarter, about $600 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by favorable results from product derivatives and hedging. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Market-driven and discrete items for the quarter include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in customer accounts and also include a charge for legal costs in Retirement, driven by cases, we believe, are nearing -- are approaching conclusion. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our GAAP net income of $1.8 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $649 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $125 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives in hedging had a positive impact of $553 million, mainly driven by GAAP-embedded derivatives and related items for Annuities living benefits. 
Impairments in credit losses of $40 million were the lowest of the past 5 quarters. The gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from our international operations and is largely driven by currency-related gains. The current quarter income from divested businesses mainly reflects results from long-term care and the Closed Block. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 5. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $35 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations as well as a favorable true-up. In addition, results benefited from a greater net contribution from policy charges and fees due to the refinements we recently implemented in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as higher account values. We estimate that our changes in risk management strategy contributed just under 5 points to return on assets, or ROA, for the quarter, with a little over 5 additional points from favorable investment returns relative to average expectations and from the true-up in the quarter. 
Keep in mind that quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline, and results for this quarter were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. 
Slide 6 presents our annuity sales. While total sales are essentially unchanged from a year ago, you can see the impact of our diversification strategy in the current quarter mix. Nearly 3 quarters of annuity sales comes without retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product were $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong market demand along with our successful diversification efforts. The $400 million increase in PDI sales from a year ago offset lower sales of our highest daily, or HD, product. 
Turning to Slide 7. Retirement earnings were $273 million for the quarter, up by $51 million from a year ago. The increase reflects the $75 million greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $55 million above our average expectation. This compares to non-coupon investment returns about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. 
A lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter, including reserve strengthening in a legacy case, was a partial offset. I would note that the pattern of case experience can fluctuate from one quarter to another, and we've benefited from about $100 million of favorable case experience since the beginning of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $12.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $11.5 billion a year ago, which included a $4.7 billion major case win in Full Service. Gross sales of Institutional Investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $7 billion, with roughly $4 billion of new pension risk transfer cases, including about $3 billion of funded business and $1 billion of longevity reinsurance. In addition, stable value wraps contributed about $2 billion to current quarter sales. 
Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $5 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9. Asset Management earnings were $191 million for the quarter compared to $180 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partly offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter and a $6 million lower contribution from other related revenues. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees for management of fixed income assets, driven by growth in assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate, partly offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $4.3 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from institutional and retail business, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 10. Individual Life earnings were $111 million for the quarter, down $72 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience, with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $30 million below our average expectations, including a negative impact of about $10 million from related reserve updates and amortization. This compares to a strong year-ago quarter when the contribution to earnings from claims experience was about $25 million more favorable than average expectations. 
In addition, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $20 million from reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs. These items were partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees of about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. In addition, guaranteed Universal Life sales were down from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases earlier this year. We recently announced further price increases and face amount limits for these products to help maintain appropriate returns and meet our targets for new business diversification. 
Turning to Slide 12. Group Insurance earnings were $62 million for the quarter, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million more than favorable -- more favorable than our average expectations. More favorable underwriting results also contributed to the increase. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 13. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $391 million for the quarter compared to $398 million a year ago. Excluding a $23 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, more favorable surrender experience and a greater contribution from net investment results, including earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which was slightly above our average expectations. Less favorable claims experience and higher expenses were partial offsets. 
While the current quarter contribution to results from claims experience was below the level of a year ago, it was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14. Gibraltar Life earnings were $389 million for the quarter compared to $414 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $30 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile. We also had more favorable claims experience, with a contribution to earnings about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation. These benefits were largely offset by about $25 million of higher expenses, driven largely by nonlinear items, including [indiscernible] benefit plan true-ups and office move costs in the current quarter. The current quarter contribution to earnings from net investment results was largely in line with a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees slightly less favorable than our average expectations. 
Before leaving International results, I will note that we have completed the hedging of our expected Yen earnings for 2017, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 112 per U.S. dollar. 
Turning to Slide 15. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $771 million for the current quarter, up by $55 million, or 8%, from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 63% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise nearly 60% of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to about 40% of sales a year ago. This change in mix reflects the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment and also reflects actions we've taken for yen products that are most affected by interest rates, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sales suspensions. These are generally products with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. 
While we are seeing competitors in Japan expand their efforts to sell U.S. dollar products in response to low and negative interest rates on yen-based investments, we continue to benefit from solid competitive advantages in the distribution of these products and our long-standing focus on recurring premium death protection policies, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins. 
Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 9% increase in agent count, driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments, together with higher productivity and average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up 6% from a year ago. This reflected a 13% sales increase from our life consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size, together with an increase in agent count. Third-party channel sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Sales outside Japan are up 4% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. 
Turning to Slide 16. The Corporate and Other loss was $413 million for the current quarter compared to a $308 million loss a year ago. Corporate and Other results include a number of items that are inherently variable. Net expenses were about $90 million above the year-ago quarter, with the majority of the increase driven by employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are mostly remeasured each quarter based on equity markets or share prices. The current quarter increases in Prudential stock and in the broader S&P 500 compared to meaningful declines a year ago contributed to a significant change in the impact of these plans on results. Higher current quarter costs for items such as business development and consulting and a $20 million benefit to the year-ago quarter from a reinsurance settlement also contributed to the year-over-year increase. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 17. Following the recapture of living benefit risks from our reinsurance captive earlier this year, most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts and the supporting capital are now resident in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of many of the contracts. As a result, we now view composite RBC, including our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a primary measure of our financial strength in relation to our benchmarks. On that basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the third quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 840% and 987%, respectively, as of June 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
I'll turn now to an update on the risk management refinements we implemented during the third quarter as part of the strategy to manage all our annuities product risks together within the Annuities business. We continue to manage these risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios. With the current structure, we are now managing the risks with a combination of traditional fixed income investments and derivatives held within our statutory entities. These strategy refinements are beginning to produce earnings benefits, as Mark mentioned, and are simplifying our annuities operation, reducing our capital volatility and increasing the certainty of cash flows from the business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 18. Cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, a decrease of about $500 million from June 30. This reflects the impact of the return of about $930 million to shareholders, including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases, net of cash inflows during the quarter. Our financial and total leverage ratios at September 30 remained within our targets. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we expect to move the evaluation of our dividend level to the first quarter of 2017 in order to get better aligned with our capital planning cycle. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

We're managing all the risks associated with that business within the Annuities legal entities now, meaning that the internal corporate underhedge, which was a prior contributor to earnings, capital and leverage volatility, is no longer in existence. And we're using a more stable statutory framework that reflects the long-term nature of the risks, and we've talked about that before. And as I noted in my remarks, we're using a combination of derivatives and financial assets to fully diffuse that liability. The immediate results that you've seen have been a reduced capital sensitivity to market movements. You saw that particularly in the first and second quarters, a release of about $1 billion, which we talked about last quarter. That was the basis for the $0.5 billion increase in the share repurchases that we undertook -- that were authorized, a portion of which we executed on during the course of this quarter. And those lower risks that gave rise to that release in capital are leading to lower costs to actually then manage the risks. So that resulted in an increase in AOI, about $15 million in the quarter, but we think the run rate number is more like about $20 million. And it also has certainly gave rise to what you saw below outside of AOI and the positive DAC unlocking that increased net income for the quarter as well."

I'll address the rest of your question. First of all, on annuities and the ROA. As Mark mentioned, 114 basis points is certainly driven in part by some favorable nonrecurring items and some investment lift this quarter. However, the risk management strategy, as Robert just mentioned, does create some sustainable run rate benefit. Mark mentioned that as about 4 to 5 basis points. So while we'd still say that the average expectation for ROA in this business on -- is about between 100 and 105 basis points, it'd be fair to say that the new risk management strategy creates some degree of bias towards the upper part of that range. In regard to what you asked about the retirement and the case experience, as Mark mentioned, that was adverse by about $20 million. However, half of that relates to reserve strengthening on a legacy block of business, a GIC [ph]. If you look at the pension risk transfer business itself, case experience was very modestly below average expectations in this quarter. But the same cases that result in modest adverse experience this quarter have been cumulatively $100 million positive over the last 7 quarters. So results are going to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but all evidence continues to be that this is a very solid and very well-priced book of business."

Let me start with the end question, and then maybe I'll tack back to just some further reflections on that. From a seasonality standpoint, we think that the range that we've provided of -- called $125 million to $175 million in the fourth quarter relative to the average of all 4 quarters is a trend that will persist. And so we expect to see that this year as well. You saw it in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was at the lower end of that range. And in the fourth quarter of 2015, it was the upper end of that range. Now we think about that against what we think of sort of the adjusted level of expenses. And so in Mark's opening comments, he called out the $90 million of higher than what we would consider to be a nonlinear elevated expenses relative to what we would consider to be more normal. About half that was in the businesses, and we called out the -- some of the causes of that. The other half of it was in Corporate and Other, and we also identified the causes there. If you look at the higher level of expenses and you look at our Corporate and Other, a lot of it is attributable to that word at unusually high level this quarter. And so if you kind of reflect on a more adjusted level for that, think about last quarter, we had 1 or 2 onetime charges that we adjusted for. We had an equity method investment that we wrote down and we'd some costs associated with the tender offer, we tendered for about $0.5 billion worth of debt. That brought that the adjusted number down to $335 million last quarter. If you look at the trailing 4 quarters, so not quite the question you asked about sort of year-to-date. But if you look at this quarter and go back 3, the average for those 4 quarters is around $350 million on an adjusted basis using what we've called out this quarter and last quarter. So I would think about that as sort of being indicative of a more normalized number, more kind of -- more of an adjusted number that we would more typically see. And that gives you a sense for then what you would extrapolate against looking into the fourth quarter for measuring the variance against the first 3."

There have been some continuing, albeit smaller, demonstrations in Chile around it. A couple of issues, there's a new issue involved as well. But the first issue revolves around the fact that people perceived their pensions to be low. And to solve this issue, Chile must go back to a defined benefit system. In other words, they'd like the government to fund higher pensions and to guarantee those pensions. So that's the first issue. The second issue that has arisen revolves around the pushback on the investment structure used by a couple of foreign companies in their AFP purchases. So with regard to the first issue, the government has said they have no money to fund pensions, but they have suggested that corporations pay an additional 5% into the pension system. And President Bachelet has also suggested perhaps creating a government AFP in addition to the existing AFPs. So with regard to this issue, the situation remains fluid and probably will stay that way for some time as the government sorts out what they'll do. And we think that's going to be in the first half of next year. But there are some suggestions on the table and we'll see what happens. Now in terms of Habitat, I'd like to make a couple of observations. First it's the #2 pension administrator with about a 26% market share. But we think that there are 4 key attributes of the company that are really important. First is that it focuses relentlessly on costs. In fact, it's the most efficient AFP and has the lowest fee of any of the 4 largest players, and that's really important given the context of what's going on. Secondly, it has exceptional fund performance, both on a relative and absolute basis, and that's also really important as people focus on what they're getting for their investments. Third, they have very high-quality service, and fourth, they are a leading player in the voluntary pension products. In terms of the second issue, we acquired the company with a different structure than others and not amortizing any of the intangibles. And you may recall that it took an awfully long time to gain regulatory approval, in large part due to, frankly, welcome scrutiny of our structure to make sure it met all the regulatory requirements. So from our point of view, we want to make sure that the agreement not only met the letter, but the spirit of the law. And that's why we welcome the regulatory scrutiny in order to make sure that the regulators were very comfortable with the structure that we had. So we're monitoring the situation closely, but feel as a company, Habitat is in a really good position within the industry."

First, the -- when we took the rider, when we put it together back with the host, you have a decrease in risk by virtue of doing that because you have offsetting risks that you now are able to manage within the same legal entity. So if you think about our economic liability, it has actually declined by almost $1 billion by virtue of having been able to pull those 2 entities together. So that's you're hedging less risk piece of it because you've got less risk manifesting as a result of the combination of those 2 entities. The other part of it is that the way in which we're hedging using a combination of financial instruments, fixed income instruments and derivatives is a more efficient way for us to hedge. So the very point that you made. When we're using derivatives, we're -- I don't want to get overly technical on this, but you're using the swap curve. Swap curve is negative to treasuries. When you're using fixed income instruments, we're actually getting the full benefit of the yield associated with treasuries. We're buying a lot of treasuries for that liabilities. You're actually getting a better yield on that. So it's a combination of we have less risk and, therefore, need to hedge less. And we're using a hedged strategy, which is more efficient. And that results -- and the combination of those 2 things results in lower costs to manage the risk. That means we have higher estimated gross profits in the future."

With respect to the capital framework, I think that the tone of everything, both orally and in writing, has been very much in the direction of trying to get it right for insurance companies, whether in the context of more of a bottoms-up statutory-based framework, which is reflected in the building block approach or the items that we expect will be appropriately considered in the GAAP-driven consolidated approach. So I think you have to separate the capital question into 2 parts. One is the framework and the way in which that works and particularly, how it deals with things like marking to market either side of the balance sheet and how that's done, things like margins and reserves, things like separate accounts. So there's a list of framework issues. And then separate from that, there's the question of calibration. And you heard part of our story around variable annuities and how well protected we are between reserves and capital. And you can extrapolate many of those themes to the entire company, and that's kind of what's behind my sort of chronic comment that we believe that we should be able to meet any reasonable capital standards that are set. So working through the framework, I would say that the tone of everything is very much in the direction of being appropriate for insurance. With respect to calibration, it remains to be seen.

If you include the initiatives in there, then they've grown at only around 3%. And that compares to our AOI growth that's been in excess of 4%.

It's very similar, frankly, to the approach that we took coming through the crisis. It was measured, thoughtful and disciplined, but when we see an opportunity to invest and position ourselves ahead of competition, who are cutting back or going in a different direction, we're going to invest for the future and do that. So if you look at the initiative spending, that also gives some basis for the rise in overall expenses that we have. We expect that it will generate long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth for the company. And you can see some of the benefits of that already manifesting themselves. The total gross level of initiative spending is actually much larger than what you see coming through because we're using savings that we were able to harvest from some of our early initiatives to pay for some of the initiatives that we're undertaking now. And you're also seeing some of the investments we've made in places like distribution, paying off in the form of very strong, for instance, flows in our asset management business. So we're very focused on our costs controls and that being very strategic about we're investing. And maybe what I would ask is actually pivot over to Steve and ask if he wants to elaborate at all on some of that initiative spending and how it's actually affecting the businesses."

In retail asset management, we see our investment in product paying off. In Retirement, we see our investment in our business platform paying off in terms of improved sales and improved persistency.

There are certain businesses, which will be above that ratio and other businesses that will be below that ratio. And that's really -- I like to describe it as an input, not an output. And the reason for that is we have a very high ROE as a company. And therefore, we have opportunities within our businesses to reinvest our free cash flow back into those businesses at those high returns in order to generate growth and returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. So from our standpoint, we try to balance the level of reinvestment we're making into our businesses to target where we're producing, where we have opportunities to grow and where those opportunities to grow are at sustained high ROEs. And so we could push that cash flow ratio up quite easily, but we would then starve our businesses in the form of organic growth. We think that would have a negative impact on our ROE in the long term and in our market positioning. On the other hand, we can drive it down much lower, but that would then cause us to be investing in things that would have, on the margin lower ROE. So it's a balance for us and a targeted number, and we're very comfortable with that 60% on a go-forward basis."

We do see across the industry that there has been some pressure on fees that goes across active and passive strategies for the past few years. The DOL rule will continue to support and, possibly, accelerate that trend. We still see ourselves as being very, very competitive in that context. While we see different types of flows in different parts of the business, certainly in our equities business, we've not been immune from the shift from active to passive. We've seen that in our equity business, particularly in the traditional U.S. style-box strategies. However, we're responding to that through investing in our growth in areas within equities that have shown greater resilience in that active-to-passive trend, global, international, income-oriented and factor-based investing in our quantitative management business. And then also, the very nature of the multi-manager business itself. Even as we see some degree of outflows in equity like other active managers, we've seen very robust, positive flows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. We've had those positive institutional flows for 13 straight years, and that gives us confidence in our prospects. I'd also mention that if you relate kind of equities to fixed income, certainly, equity strategies, by and large, have a higher fee basis than fixed income. But because of the high margins and the particularly attractive scale economies in our fixed income business, we only need somewhat less than $1.5 of positive fixed income flows to offset the impact of $1 of negative equity flows despite the lower fees that might be pertinent to fixed income business. So between the multi-manager strategy and our competitiveness across different asset classes, we feel ourselves very well prepared to compete, even as we do see some secular downward on fees."

1038328,281135946,1073065,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of hi",1033,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of high-quality businesses that fit well together. The balance of our businesses and risks enables us to produce strong overall earnings and also helps weather the normal variability that can occur across segments in any given quarter. 
Operating earnings per share for the quarter at $2.51, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was consistent with our internal expectations and the $2.52 that we produced in the third quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity through 9 months was healthy at about 13%. And book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew 9% over the prior year. 
While our overall results were solid, and we saw good core growth across many of our businesses, there were a number of factors that influenced the quarter. On the positive side, we reported strong investment results, benefiting from non-coupon investment returns that exceeded our average expectations. While results in this asset class do show variability, we are pleased to see the bounce back in returns following weaker results in the first half of the year. 
Our Annuities business also benefited from a more efficient approach to managing risk that positively impacted margins, which should have an element of sustainability going forward. 
On the other hand, our overall underwriting experience was less favorable than our average expectations, and this can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In addition, expenses were elevated in the quarter. Mark will discuss this in more detail, but we experienced a higher-than-usual level of charges and expenses of items that are inherently variable. 
I'll now make some high-level observations on the fundamentals in our businesses, starting with our international operations. We reported solid core growth and favorable underwriting margins at our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Foreign exchange and higher-than-typical expenses adversely impacted earnings comparison to the prior year. But otherwise, the segment produced steady, mid-single-digit core growth. Constant currency sales increased 8% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by significant increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan. 
While interest rates remain a significant challenge in Japan, we're pleased with the pricing and product actions that we have taken on yen products, and the current quarter results continue to show the benefit of our well-established distribution strength, including for U.S. dollar products. 
Our U.S. businesses also produced overall good results, though with some moving parts. At PGIM, our asset management business, we are pleased with the growth in our core earnings and assets under management. We reported another strong quarter for net flows, which contributed to PGIM's $1.1 trillion of total AUM at September 30, including over $500 billion with unaffiliated institutional and retail third-party accounts. 
And notably, we believe we are also starting to see the payback on our initiative spending in PGIM, with over $15 billion of net flows since the beginning of 2015 that are directly tied to recent strategic initiatives. 
Our Retirement business also had another good quarter, generating solid earnings and showing positive growth trends. Strong net flows in the quarter were mainly driven by our pension risk transfer business, which closed on several transactions, including one notable sale in the quarter of $2.5 billion. Although transaction activity in the PRT business is lumpy, this remains a highly attractive business in an area where we are a clear industry leader. 
Earnings and margins in our Individual Annuities business were very good. However, we continue to see some sales pressures. There are distribution uncertainties associated with the Department of Labor regulations, and the low interest rate environment influences product attractiveness. That said, our product diversification efforts have enabled us to mitigate downward sales pressures and improve our risk profile. 
In addition, actions we have taken to manage our annuity risk more efficiently enhance our confidence that Individual Annuities will represent a strong source of earnings and cash flows, with lower volatility and greater transparency going forward. 
Our U.S. protection results were mixed. Group Insurance continues to produce very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter at the low end of our expected range. However, Individual Life Insurance reported results well below our expectations due to adverse mortality and higher-than-typical charges. While we were disappointed by these results for the quarter and for the first 9 months, claim experience can fluctuate over the shorter time frames, and our overall mortality experience has been positive in aggregate over the last several years. 
I will now make some quick observations on capital deployment and regulation. We returned about $930 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Balancing capital deployment between shareholder return and strategic initiatives, while maintaining a strong capital position remains a key priority. Share repurchases in the quarter as well as our remaining authorization for 2016 include amounts related to the capital that was freed up from our variable annuity restructuring. Nonetheless, we continue to expect about 60% of our earnings over time to be available for shareholder returns and other accretive actions. 
And on the regulatory front, we recently issued comment letters to the Federal Reserve in response to proposals for capital requirements as well as for corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. This continues to be an iterative process with a long way to go, but we remain encouraged by the efforts of the Fed to put into place an appropriate set of standards for insurance entities. 
In conclusion, we remain positive on our prospects and ability to generate differentiated returns and strong cash flows in an evolving and challenging environment. We continue to invest in our businesses with initiatives that have both shorter and longer-term payback periods. A good portion of these expenses are financed through efficiency gains that we've been able to achieve across our operations. But ultimately, our investments in products, distribution and technology, including how we engage with customers, will enable us to continue to succeed and capitalize on growth opportunities over the long time frames. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark."
1038328,281135946,1073065,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

Special thanks to those of you in Chicago, who are participating in our earlier-than-usual call this morning. 
I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights, and I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.66 per share for the quarter compared to $2.40 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses remained solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our Asset Management and Annuities businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, earnings per share was essentially flat compared to a year ago as the year-over-year comparison was affected by fluctuations in a few inherently variable items. 
I'll mention a few highlights. First, higher current quarter net expenses within our Corporate and Other results and in several businesses, largely driven by higher-than-typical charges for items such as employee benefit and compensation plans and legal costs; second, less favorable underwriting experience compared to a contribution more favorable than our average expectations a year ago; and third, more favorable net investment results, with current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees above our average expectations. The items I mentioned, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a net negative impact of roughly $0.30 per share on the comparison of our results to a year ago. 
The net impact of current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations contributed about $0.05 per share to earnings related to favorable non-coupon investment income, prepayment fees and net adverse claims experienced across businesses, together with reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs in Individual Life. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $7.22 for the first 9 months of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. 
In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, a number of our businesses have had higher-than-average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the seasonal impact of items such as annual policyholder communications and onboarding as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. 
Looking back over the past 3 years, this pattern has produced, on average, about $125 million to $175 million higher expenses in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the full year. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.8 billion for the current quarter, about $600 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by favorable results from product derivatives and hedging. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Market-driven and discrete items for the quarter include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in customer accounts and also include a charge for legal costs in Retirement, driven by cases, we believe, are nearing -- are approaching conclusion. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our GAAP net income of $1.8 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $649 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $125 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $553 million, mainly driven by GAAP-embedded derivatives and related items for Annuities living benefits. 
Impairments and credit losses of $40 million were the lowest of the past 5 quarters. The gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from our international operations and is largely driven by currency-related gains. The current quarter income from divested businesses mainly reflects results from long-term care and the Closed Block. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 5. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $35 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations as well as a favorable true-up. In addition, results benefited from a greater net contribution from policy charges and fees due to the refinements we recently implemented in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as higher account values. We estimate that our changes in risk management strategy contributed just under 5 points to return on assets, or ROA, for the quarter, with a little over 5 additional points from favorable investment returns relative to average expectations and from the true-up in the quarter. 
Keep in mind that quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline, and results for this quarter were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. 
Slide 6 presents our annuity sales. While total sales are essentially unchanged from a year ago, you can see the impact of our diversification strategy in the current quarter mix. Nearly 3/4 of annuity sales comes without retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product were $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong market demand along with our successful diversification efforts. The $400 million increase in PDI sales from a year ago offset lower sales of our highest daily, or HD, product. 
Turning to Slide 7. Retirement earnings were $273 million for the quarter, up by $51 million from a year ago. The increase reflects the $75 million greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $55 million above our average expectation. This compares to non-coupon investment returns about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. 
A lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter, including reserve strengthening in a legacy case, was a partial offset. I would note that the pattern of case experience can fluctuate from one quarter to another, and we've benefited from about $100 million of favorable case experience since the beginning of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $12.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $11.5 billion a year ago, which included a $4.7 billion major case win in Full Service. Gross sales of Institutional Investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $7 billion, with roughly $4 billion of new pension risk transfer cases, including about $3 billion of funded business and $1 billion of longevity reinsurance. In addition, stable value wraps contributed about $2 billion to current quarter sales. 
Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $5 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9. Asset Management earnings were $191 million for the quarter compared to $180 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partly offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter and a $6 million lower contribution from other related revenues. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees for management of fixed income assets, driven by growth in assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate, partly offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $4.3 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from institutional and retail business, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 10. Individual Life earnings were $111 million for the quarter, down $72 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience, with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $30 million below our average expectations, including a negative impact of about $10 million from related reserve updates and amortization. This compares to a strong year-ago quarter when the contribution to earnings from claims experience was about $25 million more favorable than average expectations. 
In addition, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $20 million from reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs. These items were partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees of about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. In addition, guaranteed Universal Life sales were down from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases earlier this year. We recently announced further price increases and face amount limits for these products to help maintain appropriate returns and meet our targets for new business diversification. 
Turning to Slide 12. Group Insurance earnings were $62 million for the quarter, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million more than favorable -- more favorable than our average expectations. More favorable underwriting results also contributed to the increase. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 13. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $391 million for the quarter compared to $398 million a year ago. Excluding a $23 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, more favorable surrender experience and a greater contribution from net investment results, including earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were slightly above our average expectations. Less favorable claims experience and higher expenses were partial offsets. 
While the current quarter contribution to results from claims experience was below the level of a year ago, it was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14. Gibraltar Life earnings were $389 million for the quarter compared to $414 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $30 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile. We also had more favorable claims experience, with a contribution to earnings about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation. These benefits were largely offset by about $25 million of higher expenses, driven largely by nonlinear items, including employee benefit plan true-ups and office move costs in the current quarter. The current quarter contribution to earnings from net investment results was largely in line with a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees slightly less favorable than our average expectations. 
Before leaving International results, I will note that we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2017, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 112 per U.S. dollar. 
Turning to Slide 15. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $771 million for the current quarter, up by $55 million, or 8%, from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 63% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise nearly 60% of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to about 40% of sales a year ago. This change in mix reflects the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment and also reflects actions we've taken for yen products that are most affected by interest rates, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sales suspensions. These are generally products with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. 
While we are seeing competitors in Japan expand their efforts to sell U.S. dollar products in response to low and negative interest rates on yen-based investments, we continue to benefit from solid competitive advantages in the distribution of these products and our long-standing focus on recurring premium death protection policies, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins. 
Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 9% increase in agent count, driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments, together with higher productivity and average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up 6% from a year ago. This reflected a 13% sales increase from our life consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size, together with an increase in agent count. Third-party channel sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Sales outside Japan are up 4% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. 
Turning to Slide 16. The Corporate and Other loss was $413 million for the current quarter compared to a $308 million loss a year ago. Corporate and Other results include a number of items that are inherently variable. Net expenses were about $90 million above the year-ago quarter, with the majority of the increase driven by employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are mostly remeasured each quarter based on equity markets or share prices. The current quarter increases in Prudential stock and in the broader S&P 500 compared to meaningful declines a year ago contributed to a significant change in the impact of these plans on results. Higher current quarter costs for items such as business development and consulting and a $20 million benefit to the year-ago quarter from a reinsurance settlement also contributed to the year-over-year increase.

I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 17. Following the recapture of living benefit risks from our reinsurance captive earlier this year, most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts and the supporting capital are now resident in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of many of the contracts. As a result, we now view composite RBC, including our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a primary measure of our financial strength in relation to our benchmarks. On that basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the third quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 840% and 987%, respectively, as of June 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
I'll turn now to an update on the risk management refinements we implemented during the third quarter as part of the strategy to manage all our annuities product risks together within the Annuities business. We continue to manage these risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios. With the current structure, we are now managing the risks with a combination of traditional fixed income investments and derivatives held within our statutory entities. These strategy refinements are beginning to produce earnings benefits, as Mark mentioned, and are simplifying our annuities operation, reducing our capital volatility and increasing the certainty of cash flows from the business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 18. Cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, a decrease of about $500 million from June 30. This reflects the impact of the return of about $930 million to shareholders, including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases, net of cash inflows during the quarter. Our financial and total leverage ratios at September 30 remained within our targets. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we expect to move the evaluation of our dividend level to the first quarter of 2017 in order to get better aligned with our capital planning cycle. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And actually in talking about the Annuities piece, it's a good story. So I'm going to actually spend a minute on it, if you don't mind. So recall that we completed this in 3 phases. The first at the end of last year, where we got regulatory approval for the statutory framework that we were undertaking. The second phase completed in the second quarter, where we actually recaptured the living benefit rider. And then what you've seen in this quarter is that we migrated over to our new risk management strategy, and that strategy is what gave rise to the earnings enhancement that you asked about. The outcomes of those 3 phases have been that first, we reorganized and simplified the legal entity structure that supports our Annuities business. We're managing all the risks associated with that business within the Annuities legal entities now, meaning that the internal corporate underhedge, which was a prior contributor to earnings, capital and leverage volatility, is no longer in existence. And we're using a more stable statutory framework that reflects the long-term nature of the risks, and we've talked about that before. And as I noted in my remarks, we're using a combination of derivatives and financial assets to fully diffuse that liability. The immediate results that you've seen have been a reduced capital sensitivity to market movements. You saw that particularly in the first and second quarters, a release of about $1 billion, which we talked about last quarter. That was the basis for the $0.5 billion increase in the share repurchases that we undertook -- that were authorized, a portion of which we executed on during the course of this quarter. And those lower risks that gave rise to that release in capital are leading to lower costs to actually then manage the risks. So that resulted in an increase in AOI, about $15 million in the quarter, but we think the run rate number is more like about $20 million. And it also incidentally gave rise to what you saw below outside of AOI and the positive DAC unlocking that increased net income for the quarter as well."

I'll address the rest of your question. First of all, on annuities and the ROA. As Mark mentioned, 114 basis points is certainly driven in part by some favorable nonrecurring items and some investment lift this quarter. However, the risk management strategy, as Rob just mentioned, does create some sustainable run rate benefit. Mark mentioned that as about 4 to 5 basis points. So while we'd still say that the average expectation for ROA in this business on -- is about between 100 and 105 basis points, it'd be fair to say that the new risk management strategy creates some degree of bias towards the upper part of that range. In regard to what you asked about the retirement and the case experience, as Mark mentioned, that was adverse by about $20 million. However, half of that relates to reserve strengthening on a legacy block of business, a GIC. If you look at the pension risk transfer business itself, case experience was very modestly below average expectations in this quarter. But the same cases that result in modest adverse experience this quarter have been cumulatively $100 million positive over the last 7 quarters. So results are going to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but all evidence continues to be that this is a very solid and very well-priced book of business."

Let me start with the end question, and then maybe I'll tack back to just some further reflections on that. From a seasonality standpoint, we think that the range that we've provided of -- call it the $125 million to $175 million in the fourth quarter relative to the average of all 4 quarters is a trend that will persist. And so we expect to see that this year as well. You saw it in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was at the lower end of that range. And in the fourth quarter of 2015, it was the upper end of that range. Now we think about that against what we think of as sort of the adjusted level of expenses. And so in Mark's opening comments, he called out the $90 million of higher than what we would consider to be -- or nonlinear elevated expenses relative to what we would consider to be more normal. About half that was in the businesses, and we called out the -- some of the causes of that. The other half of it was in Corporate and Other, and we also identified the causes there. If you look at the higher level of expenses and you look at our Corporate and Other, a lot of it is attributable to that word at unusually high level this quarter. And so if you kind of reflect on a more adjusted level for that, think about last quarter, we had 1 or 2 onetime charges that we adjusted for. We had an equity method investment that we wrote down and we had some costs associated with the tender offer, we tendered for about $0.5 billion worth of debt. That brought that the adjusted number down to $335 million last quarter. If you look at the trailing 4 quarters, so not quite the question you asked about sort of year-to-date. But if you look at this quarter and go back 3, the average for those 4 quarters is around $350 million on an adjusted basis using what we've called out this quarter and last quarter. So I would think about that as sort of being indicative of a more normalized number, more kind of -- more of an adjusted number that we would more typically see. And that gives you a sense for then what you would extrapolate against looking into the fourth quarter for measuring the variance against the first 3."

There have been some continuing, albeit smaller, demonstrations in Chile around a couple of issues, there's a new issue involved as well. But the first issue revolves around the fact that people perceive their pensions to be low. And to solve this issue, Chile must go back to a defined benefit system. In other words, they'd like the government to fund higher pensions and to guarantee those pensions. So that's the first issue. The second issue that has arisen revolves around the pushback on the investment structure used by a couple of foreign companies in their AFP purchases. So with regard to the first issue, the government has said they have no money to fund pensions, but they have suggested that corporations pay an additional 5% into the pension system. And President Bachelet has also suggested perhaps creating a government AFP in addition to the existing AFPs. So with regard to this issue, the situation remains fluid and probably will stay that way for some time as the government sorts out what they'll do. And we think that's going to be in the first half of next year. But there are some suggestions on the table and we'll see what happens. Now in terms of Habitat, I'd like to make a couple of observations. First it's the #2 pension administrator with about a 26% market share. But we think that there are 4 key attributes of the company that are really important. First is that it focuses relentlessly on costs. In fact, it's the most efficient AFP and has the lowest fee of any of the 4 largest players, and that's really important given the context of what's going on. Secondly, it has exceptional fund performance, both on a relative and absolute basis, and that's also really important as people focus on what they're getting for their investments. Third, they have very high-quality service, and fourth, they are a leading player in the voluntary pension products. In terms of the second issue, we acquired the company with a different structure than others and not amortizing any of the intangibles. And you may recall that it took an awfully long time to gain regulatory approval, in large part due to, frankly, welcome scrutiny of our structure to make sure it met all the regulatory requirements. So from our point of view, we wanted to make sure that the agreement not only met the letter, but the spirit of the law. And that's why we welcome the regulatory scrutiny in order to make sure that the regulators were very comfortable with the structure that we had. So we're monitoring the situation closely, but feel as a company, Habitat is in a really good position within the industry."

First, the -- when we took the rider, when we put it together back with the host, you have a decrease in risk by virtue of doing that because you have offsetting risks that you now are able to manage within the same legal entity. So if you think about our economic liability, it has actually declined by almost $1 billion by virtue of having been able to pull those 2 entities together. So that's you're hedging less risk piece of it because you've got less risk manifesting as a result of the combination of those 2 entities. The other part of it is that the way in which we're hedging using a combination of financial instruments, fixed income instruments and derivatives is a more efficient way for us to hedge. So the very point that you made. When we're using derivatives, we're -- I don't want to get overly technical on this, but you're using the swap curve. Swap curve is negative to treasuries. When you're using fixed income instruments, we're actually getting the full benefit of the yield associated with treasuries. We're buying a lot of treasuries for that liability. So you're actually getting a better yield on that. So it's a combination of we have less risk and, therefore, need to hedge less. And we're using a hedged strategy, which is more efficient. And that results -- and the combination of those 2 things results in lower costs to manage the risk. That means we have higher estimated gross profits in the future."

And it's too early and I wouldn't want to either anticipate or speak for the Fed, but we think we've made constructive recommendations that will be carefully considered. With respect to the capital framework, I think that the tone of everything, both orally and in writing, has been very much in the direction of trying to get it right for insurance companies, whether in the context of more of a bottoms-up statutory-based framework, which is reflected in the building block approach or the items that we expect will be appropriately considered in the GAAP-driven consolidated approach. So I think you have to separate the capital question into 2 parts. One is the framework and the way in which that works and particularly, how it deals with things like marking to market either side of the balance sheet and how that's done, things like margins and reserves, things like separate accounts. So there's a list of framework issues. And then separate from that, there's the question of calibration. And you heard part of our story around variable annuities and how well protected we are between reserves and capital. And you can extrapolate many of those themes to the entire company, and that's kind of what's behind my sort of chronic comment that we believe that we should be able to meet any reasonable capital standards that are set. So working through the framework, I would say that the tone of everything is very much in the direction of being appropriate for insurance. With respect to calibration, it remains to be seen. But again, we are extraordinarily strong considering the overall loss absorption capacity of the company."

I don't think we want to provide sort of that granule -- granular a sort of a level of visibility into it. There are a number of things that go into that. We identified the things that would account for the larger portion of the amount that we provided to you. But since the topic's come up again, let me just take maybe an extra minute on expenses because I know it's -- given that it's been raised twice, it's an area of interest. As a firm, we pay a lot of attention to costs. We've been really disciplined about growing our costs over time. If you look back as a -- over the last couple of years, what you would see is that our expenses, excluding the initiatives that we've undertaken, have only grown over the last since 2015 -- actually since 2013 have only grown around 1%. If you include the initiatives in there, then they've grown at only around 3%. And that compares to our AOI growth that's been in excess of 4%. So we've been very disciplined about costs, and therefore, you haven't seen us having to do large cutbacks in our cost structure as a result of being controlled in the way that we've grown it to begin with. But having said that, we've also been very strategic in how and where we've chosen to invest our expense dollars and those are the initiatives that we repeatedly refer to. It's very similar, frankly, to the approach that we took coming through the crisis. It was measured, thoughtful and disciplined, but when we see an opportunity to invest and position ourselves ahead of competition, who are cutting back or going in a different direction, we're going to invest for the future and do that. So if you look at the initiative spending, that also gives some basis for the rise in overall expenses that we have. We expect that it will generate long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth for the company. And you can see some of the benefits of that already manifesting themselves. The total gross level of initiative spending is actually much larger than what you see coming through because we're using savings that we were able to harvest from some of our early initiatives to pay for some of the initiatives that we're undertaking now. And you're also seeing some of the investments we've made in places like distribution, paying off in the form of very strong, for instance, flows in our asset management business. So we're very focused on our costs, controlled on that, being very strategic about where we're investing. And maybe what I'll ask is actually pivot over to Steve and ask if he wants to elaborate at all on some of that initiative spending and how it's actually affecting the businesses."

There are certain businesses, which will be above that ratio and other businesses that will be below that ratio. And that's really -- I like to describe it as an input, not an output. And the reason for that is we have a very high ROE as a company. And therefore, we have opportunities within our businesses to reinvest our free cash flow back into those businesses at those high returns in order to generate growth at returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. So from our standpoint, we try to balance the level of reinvestment we're making into our businesses to target where we're producing, where we have opportunities to grow and where those opportunities to grow are at sustained high ROEs. And so we could push that cash flow ratio up quite easily, but we would then starve our businesses in the form of organic growth. We think that would have a negative impact on our ROE in the long term and in our market positioning. On the other hand, we can drive it down much lower, but that would then cause us to be investing in things that would have, on the margin lower ROE. So it's a balance for us and a targeted number, and we're very comfortable with that 60% on a go-forward basis."

We do see across the industry that there has been some pressure on fees that goes across active and passive strategies for the past few years. The DOL rule will continue to support and, possibly, accelerate that trend. We still see ourselves as being very, very competitive in that context. While we see different types of flows in different parts of the business, certainly in our equities business, we've not been immune from the shift from active to passive. We've seen that in our equity business, particularly in the traditional U.S. style-box strategies. However, we're responding to that through investing in our growth in areas within equities that have shown greater resilience in that active-to-passive trend, global, international, income-oriented and factor-based investing in our quantitative management business. And then also, the very nature of the multi-manager business itself. Even as we see some degree of outflows in equity like other active managers, we've seen very robust, positive flows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. We've had those positive institutional flows for 13 straight years, and that gives us confidence in our prospects. I'd also mention that if you relate kind of equities to fixed income, certainly, equity strategies, by and large, have a higher fee basis than fixed income. But because of the high margins and the particularly attractive scale economies in our fixed income business, we only need somewhat less than $1.50 of positive fixed income flows to offset the impact of $1 of negative equity flows despite the lower fees that might be pertinent to fixed income business. So between the multi-manager strategy and our competitiveness across different asset classes, we feel ourselves very well prepared to compete, even as we do see some secular trends [ph] downward on fees."

Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter, and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of high-quality businesses that fit well together. The balance of our businesses and risks enables us to produce strong overall earnings and also helps weather the normal variability that can occur across segments in any given quarter. 
Operating earnings per share for the quarter at $2.51, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was consistent with our internal expectations and the $2.52 that we produced in the third quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity through 9 months was healthy at about 13%. And book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement, grew 9% over the prior year. 
While our overall results were solid, and we saw good core growth across many of our businesses, there were a number of factors that influenced the quarter. On the positive side, we reported strong investment results, benefiting from non-coupon investment returns that exceeded our average expectations. While results in this asset class do show variability, we are pleased to see the bounce back in returns following weaker results in the first half of the year. 
Our Annuities business also benefited from a more efficient approach to managing risk that positively impacted margins, which should have an element of sustainability going forward. 
On the other hand, our overall underwriting experience was less favorable than our average expectations, and this can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In addition, expenses were elevated in the quarter. Mark will discuss this in more detail, but we experienced a higher-than-usual level of charges and expenses of items that are inherently variable. 
I'll now make some high-level observations on the fundamentals in our businesses, starting with our international operations. We reported solid core growth and favorable underwriting margins at our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Foreign exchange and higher-than-typical expenses adversely impacted earnings comparison to the prior year. But otherwise, the segment produced steady, mid-single-digit core growth. Constant currency sales increased 8% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by significant increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan. 
While interest rates remain a significant challenge in Japan, we're pleased with the pricing and product actions that we have taken on yen products, and the current quarter results continue to show the benefit of our well-established distribution strength, including for U.S. dollar products. 
Our U.S. businesses also produced overall good results, though with some moving parts. At PGIM, our asset management business, we are pleased with the growth in our core earnings and assets under management. We reported another strong quarter for net flows, which contributed to PGIM's $1.1 trillion of total AUM at September 30, including over $500 billion with unaffiliated institutional and retail third-party accounts. 
And notably, we believe we are also starting to see the payback on our initiative spending in PGIM, with over $15 billion of net flows since the beginning of 2015 that are directly tied to recent strategic initiatives. 
Our Retirement business also had another good quarter, generating solid earnings and showing positive growth trends. Strong net flows in the quarter were mainly driven by our pension risk transfer business, which closed on several transactions, including one notable sale in the quarter of $2.5 billion. Although transaction activity in the PRT business is lumpy, this remains a highly attractive business in an area where we are a clear industry leader. 
Earnings and margins in our Individual Annuities business were very good. However, we continue to see some sales pressures. There are distribution uncertainties associated with the Department of Labor regulations, and the low interest rate environment influences product attractiveness. That said, our product diversification efforts have enabled us to mitigate downward sales pressures and improve our risk profile. 
In addition, actions we have taken to manage our annuity risk more efficiently enhance our confidence that Individual Annuities will represent a strong source of earnings and cash flows, with lower volatility and greater transparency going forward. 
Our U.S. protection results were mixed. Group Insurance continues to produce very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter at the low end of our expected range. However, Individual Life Insurance reported results well below our expectations due to adverse mortality and higher-than-typical charges. While we were disappointed by these results for the quarter and for the first 9 months, claim experience can fluctuate over the shorter time frames, and our overall mortality experience has been positive in aggregate over the last several years. 
I will now make some quick observations on capital deployment and regulation. We returned about $930 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Balancing capital deployment between shareholder return and strategic initiatives, while maintaining a strong capital position remains a key priority. Share repurchases in the quarter as well as our remaining authorization for 2016 include amounts related to the capital that was freed up from our variable annuity restructuring. Nonetheless, we continue to expect about 60% of our earnings over time to be available for shareholder returns and other accretive actions. 
And on the regulatory front, we recently issued comment letters to the Federal Reserve in response to proposals for capital requirements as well as for corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. This continues to be an iterative process with a long way to go, but we remain encouraged by the efforts of the Fed to put into place an appropriate set of standards for insurance entities. 
In conclusion, we remain positive on our prospects and ability to generate differentiated returns and strong cash flows in an evolving and challenging environment. We continue to invest in our businesses with initiatives that have both shorter and longer-term payback periods. A good portion of these expenses are financed through efficiency gains that we've been able to achieve across our operations. But ultimately, our investments in products, distribution and technology, including how we engage with customers, will enable us to continue to succeed and capitalize on growth opportunities over the long time frames. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark."

Special thanks to those of you in Chicago, who are participating in our earlier-than-usual call this morning. 
I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights, and I'll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.66 per share for the quarter compared to $2.40 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses remained solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our Asset Management and Annuities businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, earnings per share was essentially flat compared to a year ago as the year-over-year comparison was affected by fluctuations in a few inherently variable items. 
I'll mention a few highlights. First, higher current quarter net expenses within our Corporate and Other results and in several businesses, largely driven by higher-than-typical charges for items such as employee benefit and compensation plans and legal costs; second, less favorable underwriting experience compared to a contribution more favorable than our average expectations a year ago; and third, more favorable net investment results, with current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees above our average expectations. The items I mentioned, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a net negative impact of roughly $0.30 per share on the comparison of our results to a year ago. 
The net impact of current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations contributed about $0.05 per share to earnings related to favorable non-coupon investment income, prepayment fees and net adverse claims experienced across businesses, together with reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs in Individual Life. 
After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $7.22 for the first 9 months of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. 
In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, a number of our businesses have had higher-than-average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the seasonal impact of items such as annual policyholder communications and onboarding as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. 
Looking back over the past 3 years, this pattern has produced, on average, about $125 million to $175 million higher expenses in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the full year. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.8 billion for the current quarter, about $600 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by favorable results from product derivatives and hedging. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Market-driven and discrete items for the quarter include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in customer accounts and also include a charge for legal costs in Retirement, driven by cases, we believe, are nearing -- are approaching conclusion. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our GAAP net income of $1.8 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $649 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $125 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $553 million, mainly driven by GAAP-embedded derivatives and related items for Annuities living benefits. 
Impairments and credit losses of $40 million were the lowest of the past 5 quarters. The gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from our international operations and is largely driven by currency-related gains. The current quarter income from divested businesses mainly reflects results from long-term care and the Closed Block. 
Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 5. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $35 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations as well as a favorable true-up. In addition, results benefited from a greater net contribution from policy charges and fees due to the refinements we recently implemented in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as higher account values. We estimate that our changes in risk management strategy contributed just under 5 points to return on assets, or ROA, for the quarter, with a little over 5 additional points from favorable investment returns relative to average expectations and from the true-up in the quarter. 
Keep in mind that quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline, and results for this quarter were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. 
Slide 6 presents our annuity sales. While total sales are essentially unchanged from a year ago, you can see the impact of our diversification strategy in the current quarter mix. Nearly 3/4 of annuity sales comes without retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product were $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong market demand along with our successful diversification efforts. The $400 million increase in PDI sales from a year ago offset lower sales of our highest daily, or HD, product. 
Turning to Slide 7. Retirement earnings were $273 million for the quarter, up by $51 million from a year ago. The increase reflects the $75 million greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $55 million above our average expectation. This compares to non-coupon investment returns about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. 
A lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter, including reserve strengthening in a legacy case, was a partial offset. I would note that the pattern of case experience can fluctuate from one quarter to another, and we've benefited from about $100 million of favorable case experience since the beginning of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $12.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $11.5 billion a year ago, which included a $4.7 billion major case win in Full Service. Gross sales of Institutional Investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $7 billion, with roughly $4 billion of new pension risk transfer cases, including about $3 billion of funded business and $1 billion of longevity reinsurance. In addition, stable value wraps contributed about $2 billion to current quarter sales. 
Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in Full Service and Institutional Investment products, totaling about $5 billion. 
Turning to Slide 9. Asset Management earnings were $191 million for the quarter compared to $180 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partly offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter and a $6 million lower contribution from other related revenues. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees for management of fixed income assets, driven by growth in assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate, partly offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $4.3 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from institutional and retail business, each driven by fixed income flows. 
Turning to Slide 10. Individual Life earnings were $111 million for the quarter, down $72 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience, with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $30 million below our average expectations, including a negative impact of about $10 million from related reserve updates and amortization. This compares to a strong year-ago quarter when the contribution to earnings from claims experience was about $25 million more favorable than average expectations. 
In addition, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $20 million from reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs. These items were partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees of about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. In addition, guaranteed Universal Life sales were down from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases earlier this year. We recently announced further price increases and face amount limits for these products to help maintain appropriate returns and meet our targets for new business diversification. 
Turning to Slide 12. Group Insurance earnings were $62 million for the quarter, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million more than favorable -- more favorable than our average expectations. More favorable underwriting results also contributed to the increase. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. 
Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 13. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $391 million for the quarter compared to $398 million a year ago. Excluding a $23 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, more favorable surrender experience and a greater contribution from net investment results, including earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were slightly above our average expectations. Less favorable claims experience and higher expenses were partial offsets. 
While the current quarter contribution to results from claims experience was below the level of a year ago, it was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14. Gibraltar Life earnings were $389 million for the quarter compared to $414 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $30 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile. We also had more favorable claims experience, with a contribution to earnings about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation. These benefits were largely offset by about $25 million of higher expenses, driven largely by nonlinear items, including employee benefit plan true-ups and office move costs in the current quarter. The current quarter contribution to earnings from net investment results was largely in line with a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees slightly less favorable than our average expectations. 
Before leaving International results, I will note that we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2017, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 112 per U.S. dollar. 
Turning to Slide 15. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $771 million for the current quarter, up by $55 million, or 8%, from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 63% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise nearly 60% of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to about 40% of sales a year ago. This change in mix reflects the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment and also reflects actions we've taken for yen products that are most affected by interest rates, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sales suspensions. These are generally products with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single-premium products. 
While we are seeing competitors in Japan expand their efforts to sell U.S. dollar products in response to low and negative interest rates on yen-based investments, we continue to benefit from solid competitive advantages in the distribution of these products and our long-standing focus on recurring premium death protection policies, with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins. 
Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 9% increase in agent count, driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments, together with higher productivity and average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up 6% from a year ago. This reflected a 13% sales increase from our life consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size, together with an increase in agent count. Third-party channel sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Sales outside Japan are up 4% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. 
Turning to Slide 16. The Corporate and Other loss was $413 million for the current quarter compared to a $308 million loss a year ago. Corporate and Other results include a number of items that are inherently variable. Net expenses were about $90 million above the year-ago quarter, with the majority of the increase driven by employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are mostly remeasured each quarter based on equity markets or share prices. The current quarter increases in Prudential stock and in the broader S&P 500 compared to meaningful declines a year ago contributed to a significant change in the impact of these plans on results. Higher current quarter costs for items such as business development and consulting and a $20 million benefit to the year-ago quarter from a reinsurance settlement also contributed to the year-over-year increase. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rob."

I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest. 
Starting on Slide 17. Following the recapture of living benefit risks from our reinsurance captive earlier this year, most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts and the supporting capital are now resident in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of many of the contracts. As a result, we now view composite RBC, including our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a primary measure of our financial strength in relation to our benchmarks. On that basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the third quarter. 
In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 840% and 987%, respectively, as of June 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. 
I'll turn now to an update on the risk management refinements we implemented during the third quarter as part of the strategy to manage all our annuities product risks together within the Annuities business. We continue to manage these risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios. With the current structure, we are now managing the risks with a combination of traditional fixed income investments and derivatives held within our statutory entities. These strategy refinements are beginning to produce earnings benefits, as Mark mentioned, and are simplifying our annuities operation, reducing our capital volatility and increasing the certainty of cash flows from the business. 
Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on Slide 18. Cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, a decrease of about $500 million from June 30. This reflects the impact of the return of about $930 million to shareholders, including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases, net of cash inflows during the quarter. Our financial and total leverage ratios at September 30 remained within our targets. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we expect to move the evaluation of our dividend level to the first quarter of 2017 in order to get better aligned with our capital planning cycle. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And actually in talking about the Annuities piece, it's a good story. So I'm going to actually spend a minute on it, if you don't mind. So recall that we completed this in 3 phases. The first at the end of last year, where we got regulatory approval for the statutory framework that we were undertaking. The second phase completed in the second quarter, where we actually recaptured the living benefit rider. And then what you've seen in this quarter is that we migrated over to our new risk management strategy, and that strategy is what gave rise to the earnings enhancement that you asked about. The outcomes of those 3 phases have been that first, we reorganized and simplified the legal entity structure that supports our Annuities business. We're managing all the risks associated with that business within the Annuities legal entities now, meaning that the internal corporate underhedge, which was a prior contributor to earnings, capital and leverage volatility, is no longer in existence. And we're using a more stable statutory framework that reflects the long-term nature of the risks, and we've talked about that before. And as I noted in my remarks, we're using a combination of derivatives and financial assets to fully diffuse that liability. The immediate results that you've seen have been a reduced capital sensitivity to market movements. You saw that particularly in the first and second quarters, a release of about $1 billion, which we talked about last quarter. That was the basis for the $0.5 billion increase in the share repurchases that we undertook -- that were authorized, a portion of which we executed on during the course of this quarter. And those lower risks that gave rise to that release in capital are leading to lower costs to actually then manage the risks. So that resulted in an increase in AOI, about $15 million in the quarter, but we think the run rate number is more like about $20 million. And it also incidentally gave rise to what you saw below outside of AOI and the positive DAC unlocking that increased net income for the quarter as well."

I'll address the rest of your question. First of all, on annuities and the ROA. As Mark mentioned, 114 basis points is certainly driven in part by some favorable nonrecurring items and some investment lift this quarter. However, the risk management strategy, as Rob just mentioned, does create some sustainable run rate benefit. Mark mentioned that as about 4 to 5 basis points. So while we'd still say that the average expectation for ROA in this business on -- is about between 100 and 105 basis points, it'd be fair to say that the new risk management strategy creates some degree of bias towards the upper part of that range. In regard to what you asked about the retirement and the case experience, as Mark mentioned, that was adverse by about $20 million. However, half of that relates to reserve strengthening on a legacy block of business, a GIC. If you look at the pension risk transfer business itself, case experience was very modestly below average expectations in this quarter. But the same cases that result in modest adverse experience this quarter have been cumulatively $100 million positive over the last 7 quarters. So results are going to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but all evidence continues to be that this is a very solid and very well-priced book of business."

Let me start with the end question, and then maybe I'll tack back to just some further reflections on that. From a seasonality standpoint, we think that the range that we've provided of -- call it the $125 million to $175 million in the fourth quarter relative to the average of all 4 quarters is a trend that will persist. And so we expect to see that this year as well. You saw it in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was at the lower end of that range. And in the fourth quarter of 2015, it was the upper end of that range. Now we think about that against what we think of as sort of the adjusted level of expenses. And so in Mark's opening comments, he called out the $90 million of higher than what we would consider to be -- or nonlinear elevated expenses relative to what we would consider to be more normal. About half that was in the businesses, and we called out the -- some of the causes of that. The other half of it was in Corporate and Other, and we also identified the causes there. If you look at the higher level of expenses and you look at our Corporate and Other, a lot of it is attributable to that word at unusually high level this quarter. And so if you kind of reflect on a more adjusted level for that, think about last quarter, we had 1 or 2 onetime charges that we adjusted for. We had an equity method investment that we wrote down and we had some costs associated with the tender offer, we tendered for about $0.5 billion worth of debt. That brought that the adjusted number down to $335 million last quarter. If you look at the trailing 4 quarters, so not quite the question you asked about sort of year-to-date. But if you look at this quarter and go back 3, the average for those 4 quarters is around $350 million on an adjusted basis using what we've called out this quarter and last quarter. So I would think about that as sort of being indicative of a more normalized number, more kind of -- more of an adjusted number that we would more typically see. And that gives you a sense for then what you would extrapolate against looking into the fourth quarter for measuring the variance against the first 3."

There have been some continuing, albeit smaller, demonstrations in Chile around a couple of issues, there's a new issue involved as well. But the first issue revolves around the fact that people perceive their pensions to be low. And to solve this issue, Chile must go back to a defined benefit system. In other words, they'd like the government to fund higher pensions and to guarantee those pensions. So that's the first issue. The second issue that has arisen revolves around the pushback on the investment structure used by a couple of foreign companies in their AFP purchases. So with regard to the first issue, the government has said they have no money to fund pensions, but they have suggested that corporations pay an additional 5% into the pension system. And President Bachelet has also suggested perhaps creating a government AFP in addition to the existing AFPs. So with regard to this issue, the situation remains fluid and probably will stay that way for some time as the government sorts out what they'll do. And we think that's going to be in the first half of next year. But there are some suggestions on the table and we'll see what happens. Now in terms of Habitat, I'd like to make a couple of observations. First it's the #2 pension administrator with about a 26% market share. But we think that there are 4 key attributes of the company that are really important. First is that it focuses relentlessly on costs. In fact, it's the most efficient AFP and has the lowest fee of any of the 4 largest players, and that's really important given the context of what's going on. Secondly, it has exceptional fund performance, both on a relative and absolute basis, and that's also really important as people focus on what they're getting for their investments. Third, they have very high-quality service, and fourth, they are a leading player in the voluntary pension products. In terms of the second issue, we acquired the company with a different structure than others and not amortizing any of the intangibles. And you may recall that it took an awfully long time to gain regulatory approval, in large part due to, frankly, welcome scrutiny of our structure to make sure it met all the regulatory requirements. So from our point of view, we wanted to make sure that the agreement not only met the letter, but the spirit of the law. And that's why we welcome the regulatory scrutiny in order to make sure that the regulators were very comfortable with the structure that we had. So we're monitoring the situation closely, but feel as a company, Habitat is in a really good position within the industry."

So on the first -- the latter part of it, yes, when we think about that annuity as a legal entity, we really think about it as the way in which we manage it economically and we've talked -- we've articulated in the context of the CTE 97. Importantly, I always footnote that with the CTE 97 through moderately stressed scenarios. So it's to maintain that even in more adverse circumstances than we face today. The -- when you manage that way, the actual RBC calculation can get kind of funny on you. So yes, you could see something like in the order of magnitude of what you described in terms of the impact of our RBC within PALAC. And the 400%, therefore, becomes a much less meaningful number to evaluate it against and it's much better to think about it in the context of where we are against that CTE 97. Back at PICA, which is sort of once you've split PALAC out, we still believe that the 400% is the appropriate way to be looking at the PICA legal entity."

So Tom, I'd highlight the following couple of things. First, the -- when we took the rider, when we put it together back with the host, you have a decrease in risk by virtue of doing that because you have offsetting risks that you now are able to manage within the same legal entity. So if you think about our economic liability, it has actually declined by almost $1 billion by virtue of having been able to pull those 2 entities together. So that's you're hedging less risk piece of it because you've got less risk manifesting as a result of the combination of those 2 entities. The other part of it is that the way in which we're hedging using a combination of financial instruments, fixed income instruments and derivatives is a more efficient way for us to hedge. So the very point that you made. When we're using derivatives, we're -- I don't want to get overly technical on this, but you're using the swap curve. Swap curve is negative to treasuries. When you're using fixed income instruments, we're actually getting the full benefit of the yield associated with treasuries. We're buying a lot of treasuries for that liability. So you're actually getting a better yield on that. So it's a combination of we have less risk and, therefore, need to hedge less. And we're using a hedged strategy, which is more efficient. And that results -- and the combination of those 2 things results in lower costs to manage the risk. That means we have higher estimated gross profits in the future."

And it's too early and I wouldn't want to either anticipate or speak for the Fed, but we think we've made constructive recommendations that will be carefully considered. With respect to the capital framework, I think that the tone of everything, both orally and in writing, has been very much in the direction of trying to get it right for insurance companies, whether in the context of more of a bottoms-up statutory-based framework, which is reflected in the building block approach or the items that we expect will be appropriately considered in the GAAP-driven consolidated approach. So I think you have to separate the capital question into 2 parts. One is the framework and the way in which that works and particularly, how it deals with things like marking to market either side of the balance sheet and how that's done, things like margins and reserves, things like separate accounts. So there's a list of framework issues. And then separate from that, there's the question of calibration. And you heard part of our story around variable annuities and how well protected we are between reserves and capital. And you can extrapolate many of those themes to the entire company, and that's kind of what's behind my sort of chronic comment that we believe that we should be able to meet any reasonable capital standards that are set. So working through the framework, I would say that the tone of everything is very much in the direction of being appropriate for insurance. With respect to calibration, it remains to be seen. But again, we are extraordinarily strong considering the overall loss absorption capacity of the company."

I don't think we want to provide sort of that granule -- granular a sort of a level of visibility into it. There are a number of things that go into that. We identified the things that would account for the larger portion of the amount that we provided to you. But since the topic's come up again, let me just take maybe an extra minute on expenses because I know it's -- given that it's been raised twice, it's an area of interest. As a firm, we pay a lot of attention to costs. We've been really disciplined about growing our costs over time. If you look back as a -- over the last couple of years, what you would see is that our expenses, excluding the initiatives that we've undertaken, have only grown over the last since 2015 -- actually since 2013 have only grown around 1%. If you include the initiatives in there, then they've grown at only around 3%. And that compares to our AOI growth that's been in excess of 4%. So we've been very disciplined about costs, and therefore, you haven't seen us having to do large cutbacks in our cost structure as a result of being controlled in the way that we've grown it to begin with. But having said that, we've also been very strategic in how and where we've chosen to invest our expense dollars and those are the initiatives that we repeatedly refer to. It's very similar, frankly, to the approach that we took coming through the crisis. It was measured, thoughtful and disciplined, but when we see an opportunity to invest and position ourselves ahead of competition, who are cutting back or going in a different direction, we're going to invest for the future and do that. So if you look at the initiative spending, that also gives some basis for the rise in overall expenses that we have. We expect that it will generate long-term, sustainable top and bottom line growth for the company. And you can see some of the benefits of that already manifesting themselves. The total gross level of initiative spending is actually much larger than what you see coming through because we're using savings that we were able to harvest from some of our early initiatives to pay for some of the initiatives that we're undertaking now. And you're also seeing some of the investments we've made in places like distribution, paying off in the form of very strong, for instance, flows in our asset management business. So we're very focused on our costs, controlled on that, being very strategic about where we're investing. And maybe what I'll ask is actually pivot over to Steve and ask if he wants to elaborate at all on some of that initiative spending and how it's actually affecting the businesses."

There are certain businesses, which will be above that ratio and other businesses that will be below that ratio. And that's really -- I like to describe it as an input, not an output. And the reason for that is we have a very high ROE as a company. And therefore, we have opportunities within our businesses to reinvest our free cash flow back into those businesses at those high returns in order to generate growth at returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. So from our standpoint, we try to balance the level of reinvestment we're making into our businesses to target where we're producing, where we have opportunities to grow and where those opportunities to grow are at sustained high ROEs. And so we could push that cash flow ratio up quite easily, but we would then starve our businesses in the form of organic growth. We think that would have a negative impact on our ROE in the long term and in our market positioning. On the other hand, we can drive it down much lower, but that would then cause us to be investing in things that would have, on the margin lower ROE.

We do see across the industry that there has been some pressure on fees that goes across active and passive strategies for the past few years. The DOL rule will continue to support and, possibly, accelerate that trend. We still see ourselves as being very, very competitive in that context. While we see different types of flows in different parts of the business, certainly in our equities business, we've not been immune from the shift from active to passive. We've seen that in our equity business, particularly in the traditional U.S. style-box strategies. However, we're responding to that through investing in our growth in areas within equities that have shown greater resilience in that active-to-passive trend, global, international, income-oriented and factor-based investing in our quantitative management business. And then also, the very nature of the multi-manager business itself. Even as we see some degree of outflows in equity like other active managers, we've seen very robust, positive flows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. We've had those positive institutional flows for 13 straight years, and that gives us confidence in our prospects. I'd also mention that if you relate kind of equities to fixed income, certainly, equity strategies, by and large, have a higher fee basis than fixed income. But because of the high margins and the particularly attractive scale economies in our fixed income business, we only need somewhat less than $1.50 of positive fixed income flows to offset the impact of $1 of negative equity flows despite the lower fees that might be pertinent to fixed income business. So between the multi-manager strategy and our competitiveness across different asset classes, we feel ourselves very well prepared to compete, even as we do see some secular trends [ph] downward on fees."
