Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines.

Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $579 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our revenue overachievement compared to guidance was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services, as well as a strong holiday commerce season.
Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.72 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, the improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
We also had very strong cash generation the fourth quarter with free cash flow of $139 million. Our fourth quarter results capped off another excellent year for Akamai. In 2015, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% in constant currency over an outstanding 2014. As a result, Akamai is now one of only 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue.
Our Performance and Security Solutions topped $1 billion in revenue in 2015, making this our largest solution category. Contributing to that result were our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year and now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. We continue to be very profitable in 2015, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million or $2.52 per diluted share, up 6% over 2014 in constant currency.
I believe our excellent 2015 financial performance demonstrates that our business is strong, growing and highly profitable, validating our comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
In support of this strategy, we are laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges: Delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks that handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
Security, in particular, is a pervasive concern for customers across all verticals and geographies and it is a tremendous growth opportunity for Akamai. In addition to world-class protection, our unique cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages, such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of Web infrastructures and enhanced performance for Web applications.
When deploying Akamai's security solutions, there's no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever-changing threats. Our cloud security services are designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy unknown standard set of security protection across all of their websites regardless of how or where they are hosted. And unlike traditional approaches to security, which can slow down performance, Akamai security solutions have been shown to actually improve performance. This means that Akamai solutions can be used in an always on proactive mode, which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications.
Our Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of our security data. With our unique global platform, Akamai is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. We process this data using real-time behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve our level of protection. We're also using this data to provide advanced services, such as client reputation, which we launched late last year, and bot manager, which we plan to introduce at the upcoming RSA conference later this month.
As we look forward, we plan to expand our suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. Our first offering in this area is scheduled to be released later this year, and it will make use of our successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data. 
Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, our AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for our enterprise customers, we plan to substantially expand the addressable market for our security solutions. In the long run, we believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud with exceed our current market for protecting websites and applications.
We are also very excited about the opportunity for growth in our media business. Our Media Delivery Solutions generated nearly $1 billion of revenue in 2015 and with strong profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, the growth rate of our media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that we received from a few very large customers. 
Over the last few years, our largest 2 customers in particular have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect these 2 accounts to still be our largest media customers and that they will contribute about 6% of our overall revenue. This 7-point changing contribution results from their increased do-it-yourself or DIY efforts and it is the main reason we anticipate a lower year-over-year revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters. It is important to note that the revenue growth from the rest of our customer base remains strong. In addition, we believe that we will exit 2016 with a much more diversified revenue base that will be less subject to future changes in our largest accounts.
More importantly, as more video moves online, I believe the there is the opportunity for substantial future growth in our media business, even in the top few accounts where DIY is currently a factor. When performance matters, even the biggest media companies turn to Akamai. That's because it is very hard to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security at an affordable price point.
Our many advantages over alternative solutions include our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.
Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike. And our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale while also lowering costs.
It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase. But as OTT grews, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with our ability to deliver broadcast level of quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to cover one last item. Today, we announced an evolution of our organizational structure designed to help us better serve our customers and further accelerate growth by more tightly aligning our teams that build products with those that work day-to-day with our world-class customers. We've made great strides in diversifying our product portfolio in recent years, delivering record sales and profitability. And as we close out another excellent year, I believe that our media and Web performance and security businesses are now at the scale where a transition to this type of customer and solution centric organization makes sense. This change will become effective in Q2, does not involve layoffs and will not be disruptive for our customers. Indeed, I am looking forward to Akamai becoming even more responsive to our customer's needs and bringing innovative solutions to market at an even faster pace.
In summary, I see a very bright and exciting future for Akamai. Our rapidly growing security business has a rich collection of new products in the pipeline. We are well-positioned to benefit from the potential of very large volumes of video traffic moving online. We are well ahead of the field when it comes to improving website and application performance, especially for mobile devices. And we are just beginning to tap into an enterprise security and networking market that could someday be larger than the current market for our Web services.
This is why, in addition to the 3-year billion dollar share repurchase program recently authorized by our Board of Directors, I plan to enter into a personal 10b5-1 plan to purchase $10 million worth of Akamai stock over the next 6 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?"

Revenu",1671,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% to adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $286 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 19% on a constant currency basis and was the sole driver of our revenue overachievement. Our Web performance business benefited from a stronger-than-expected online holiday season. And we continue to see strong growth and demand for our cloud security offerings across all 3 geographies.
Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $73 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 50% on a constant currency basis. Exiting 2015, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $300 million.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $247 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the moderation in media revenue growth rates were driven by the impact DIY efforts in our largest 2 media accounts. However, the rest of our media business grew over 10% compared to a very strong Q4 of 2014.
Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year or up 21% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $163 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant-currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact of -- on revenue of nearly $14 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid growth in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets.
Revenue from our U.S. market was $416 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our 2 largest media accounts reside in the U.S. and heavily weighted on the U.S. market results. Outside of these 2 accounts, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the U.S. business.
And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q4. Moving on to cost. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q3, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, consistent with the prior quarter, down 3 points from the same period last year and about 1 point higher than our guidance due to the revenue overachievement.
GAAP operating expenses were $263 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible asset, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $211 million, up $7 million from Q3 levels and at the higher end of our guidance. 
We continue to balance investments in the business with the near-term moderation and revenue growth rates. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, up $16 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, down 2 points from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $80 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense.
Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, up $5 million from Q3 levels and slightly above our guidance. non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $168 million, up $11 million from Q3 and down $7 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels and down 4 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the fourth quarter was about $3 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88 million or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in December, which was not included in our guidance. 
Without the benefit of the R&D tax credit, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total tax is included in our GAAP earnings with $32 million based on an effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on an effective tax rate of 24% and coming in about 6 points lower than our guidance range. Again, due to the R&D tax credit.
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 180 million shares, consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. 
Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, including equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $89 million and slightly above our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $139 million in the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. To factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. 
During the quarter, we spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. For the year, we spent $300 million, buying back 4.5 million shares. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased announcer that our Board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program running from now until the end of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return to our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us in the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions
In summary, we're pleased and how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2015, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to Q1, as a result of the lower volume from our top 2 accounts and normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality patterns, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $554 million to $570 million. At the mid-point of this range, revenue growth would be 8% adjusted from foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $1 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year.
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65% to 66%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $201 million to $206 million. As I mentioned earlier, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained, long-term growth and scale.
Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been mentioning in prior calls, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. But as a reminder, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $71 million to $73 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 178 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.
In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 7.

So it wasn't exactly the percentage of business that we had in the fourth quarter. So this is -- has been gliding down slowly for the company. And as we said, we expect next year will be roughly 6%. It could be a little bit more than that, it could be a little bit less than that dependent upon, obviously, traffic volumes. But we are very, very pleased with the performance in general of our media business that our media business outside these 2 customers grew 10%. Was very, very healthy. I would say that these customers have been doing DIY for a while. And they do serve a fair amount of their traffic themselves. So depending upon traffic volumes for their businesses, we'll serve more or less traffic. But I'd say this is kind of in general, align with our expectations that I think in particular, what's going to fill this up, I think you're going to go through a period where as their revenues glide down to roughly 6% of our total revenues for the company, one, we're much more diversified in our portfolio from a customer perspective because there isn't -- customers reinformed below that are not even nearly close to the side of these customers. And these customers combined are only going to represent 6%. 
So the revenue concentration is significantly less. There's significant opportunity for growth, as I mentioned, in the media business, that the media business is very healthy in aggregate. We believe that more and more content is going to move online. Video content, in particular, that will fuel growth. We are -- our security business grew 54% in 2015. And that was only a few years ago. 4 years ago, that business was just a few million dollars. So to go from a few million dollars 4 years ago to a business now that is -- has an annualized run rate of $300 million, it's huge opportunity for growth and security and it's an opportunity for growth in other aspects of the business as well. So I think there's many pillars of growth that we think will fuel the company: media, security, Web performance and some of the new emerging areas that Tom outlined."

So again, very solid performance. And as I mentioned, we had very, very good performance in the fourth quarter. One, we started acceleration in our cloud security offerings on solutions. So those grew 54% year-over-year. We had a very strong online holiday season in the commerce space. So we had a good performance and Web performance as well. So again, I think that, that category has certainly been the fastest grower for the company. And it certainly, as Tom mentioned, the largest category for the company now.

I think the only fundamental shift there really has been with the big carriers. And basically, I'd say the shift has been more towards standardizing on Akamai. I think you look back 4, 5 years ago, most of the world's major carriers had some kind of DIY effort to build their own CDN to compete with Akamai. Maybe they bought a lot of equipment from one of the big box manufacturers. And today, most of the world's major carriers are pretty much standardizing on Akamai. Obviously, Verizon, an exception they're having purchase EdgeCast we compete with as I've said Verizon still a very large reseller for Akamai. Level 3, of course, competes, always have. The list is not long in terms of the carriers. The cloud providers, some of them partner with us, some of them have computing services. But we're not seeing erosion due to competition.

Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines.

Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $579 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our revenue overachievement compared to guidance was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services, as well as a strong holiday commerce season.
Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.72 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit in the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
We also had very strong cash generation the fourth quarter with free cash flow of $139 million. Our fourth quarter results capped off another excellent year for Akamai. In 2015, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% in constant currency over an outstanding 2014. As a result, Akamai is now one of only 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue.
Our Performance and Security Solutions topped $1 billion in revenue in 2015, making this our largest solution category. Contributing to that result were our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year and now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. We continue to be very profitable in 2015, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million or $2.52 per diluted share, up 6% over 2014 in constant currency.
I believe our excellent 2015 financial performance demonstrates that our business is strong, growing and highly profitable, validating our comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
In support of this strategy, we are laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges: Delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
Security, in particular, is a pervasive concern for customers across all verticals and geographies, and it is a tremendous growth opportunity for Akamai. In addition to world-class protection, our unique cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages, such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of Web infrastructures and enhanced performance for Web applications.
When deploying Akamai's security solutions, there is no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever-changing threats. Our cloud security services are designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy unknown standard set of security protection across all of their websites, regardless of how or where they are hosted. And unlike traditional approaches to security which can slow down performance, Akamai security solutions have been shown to actually improve performance. This means that Akamai solutions can be used in an always on proactive mode, which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications.
Our Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of our security data. With our unique global platform, Akamai is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. We process this data using real-time behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve our level of protection. We are also using this data to provide advanced services, such as Client Reputation which we launched late last year, and bot manager which we plan to introduce at the upcoming RSA conference later this month.
As we look forward, we plan to expand our suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. Our first offering in this area is scheduled to be released later this year, and it will make use of our successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data. 
Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, our AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for our enterprise customers, we plan to substantially expand the addressable market for our security solutions. In the long run, we believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud could exceed our current market for protecting websites and applications.
We are also very excited about the opportunity for growth in our media business. Our Media Delivery Solutions generated nearly $1 billion of revenue in 2015 and with strong profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, the growth rate of our media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that we received from a few very large customers. 
Over the last few years, our largest 2 customers in particular have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect these 2 accounts to still be our largest media customers and that they will contribute about 6% of our overall revenue. This 7-point change in contribution results from their increased do-it-yourself or DIY efforts, and it is the main reason we anticipate a lower year-over-year revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters. It is important to note that the revenue growth from the rest of our customer base remains strong. In addition, we believe that we will exit 2016 with a much more diversified revenue base that will be less subject to future changes in our largest accounts.
More importantly, as more video moves online, I believe that there is the opportunity for substantial future growth in our media business, even in the top few accounts where DIY is currently a factor. When performance matters, even the biggest media companies turn to Akamai. That's because it is very hard to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security at an affordable price point.
Our many advantages over alternative solutions include our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike. And our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale while also lowering costs.
It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase. But as OTT grows, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with our ability to deliver broadcast level of quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to cover one last item. Today, we announced an evolution of our organizational structure designed to help us better serve our customers and further accelerate growth by more tightly aligning our teams that build products with those that work day to day with our world-class customers. We've made great strides in diversifying our product portfolio in recent years, delivering record sales and profitability. And as we close out another excellent year, I believe that our media and Web performance and security businesses are now at the scale where a transition to this type of customer and solution-centric organization makes sense. This change will become effective in Q2, does not involve layoffs and will not be disruptive for our customers. Indeed, I am looking forward to Akamai becoming even more responsive to our customers' needs and bringing innovative solutions to market at an even faster pace.
In summary, I see a very bright and exciting future for Akamai. Our rapidly growing security business has a rich collection of new products in the pipeline. We are well positioned to benefit from the potential of very large volumes of video traffic moving online. We are well ahead of the field when it comes to improving website and application performance, especially for mobile devices. And we are just beginning to tap into an enterprise security and networking market that could someday be larger than the current market for our Web services. This is why, in addition to the 3-year billion dollar share repurchase program recently authorized by our Board of Directors, I plan to enter into a personal 10b5-1 plan to purchase $10 million worth of Akamai stock over the next 6 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?"

Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% to adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $286 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 19% on a constant currency basis and was the sole driver of our revenue overachievement. Our Web Performance business benefited from a stronger-than-expected online holiday season. And we continue to see strong growth and demand for our cloud security offerings across all 3 geographies. Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $73 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 50% on a constant currency basis. Exiting 2015, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $300 million.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $247 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the moderation in media revenue growth rates was driven by the impact of DIY efforts in our largest 2 media accounts. However, the rest of our media business grew over 10% compared to a very strong Q4 of 2014.
Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year or up 21% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $163 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant-currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact of -- on revenue of nearly $14 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid growth in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $416 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our 2 largest media accounts reside in the U.S. and heavily weighted on the U.S. markets results. Outside of these 2 accounts, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the U.S. business. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q4. 
Moving on to cost. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q3, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67% consistent with the prior quarter, down 3 points from the same period last year and about 1 point higher than our guidance due to the revenue overachievement.
GAAP operating expenses were $263 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $211 million, up $7 million from Q3 levels and at the higher end of our guidance. We continue to balance investments in the business with the near-term moderation in revenue growth rates. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, up $16 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, down 2 points from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $80 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, up $5 million from Q3 levels and slightly above our guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $168 million, up $11 million from Q3 and down $7 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels and down 4 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the fourth quarter was about $3 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88 million or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in December, which was not included in our guidance. 
Without the benefit of the R&D tax credit, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total tax is included in our GAAP earnings were $32 million based on an effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on an effective tax rate of 24% and coming in about 6 points lower than our guidance range. Again, due to the R&D tax credit. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 180 million shares, consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance.
 Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $89 million and slightly above our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $139 million in the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. 
During the quarter, we spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. For the year, we spent $300 million, buying back 4.5 million shares. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased announce that our board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program running from now until the end of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us in the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2015 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to Q1, as a result of the lower volume from our top 2 accounts and normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality patterns, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $554 million to $570 million. At the mid-point of this range, revenue growth would be 8% adjusted from foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. 
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $1 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65% to 66%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $201 million to $206 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained, long-term growth and scale.
Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been mentioning in prior calls, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. But as a reminder, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $71 million to $73 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 178 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.
In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 7.

So just to be clear that the -- the 13% references, on average, what we've received from these top 2 customers, so it wasn't exactly the percentage of the business that we had in the fourth quarter, so this has been gliding down slowly for the company. And as we said, that we expect next year it will be roughly 6%. It could be a little bit more than that. It could be a little bit less than that depending upon, obviously, traffic volumes. But we're very, very pleased with the performance, in general, of our media business. That our media business outside these 2 customers grew 10% is very, very healthy. I would say that these customers have been doing DIY for a while. And they do serve a fair amount of their traffic themselves. So depending upon traffic volumes for their businesses, we'll serve more or less traffic. But I'd say this is kind of, in general, aligned with our expectations that -- I think, in particular, what's going to fill this up, I think, you're going to go through a period where as their revenues glide down to roughly 6% of our total revenues for the company, one, we're much more diversified in our portfolio from a customer perspective because there isn't -- customers 3 and 4 and below that are not even nearly close to the side of these customers. And these customers combined are only going to represent 6%. So the revenue concentration is significantly less. There's significant opportunity for growth, as I mentioned, in the media business. That the media business is very healthy in aggregate. We believe that more and more content is going to move online. Video content, in particular, that will fuel growth. We -- our security business grew 54% in 2015. And that was only a few years ago. 4 years ago, that business was just a few million dollars. So to go from a few million dollars 4 years ago to a business now that is -- has an annualized run rate of $300 million, is huge opportunity for growth in security. And there's an opportunity for growth in other aspects of the business as well. So I think there's a many pillars of growth that we think will fuel the company, media, security, Web performance and some of the new emerging areas that Tom outlined."

Even years, you have more of those events, and they tend to be better years for our media business. And perhaps more fundamentally, those events, particularly things like the Olympics, there tends to be changes in the ecosystem: fancier TVs, this Olympics have a lot of 4K involved and so new technology gets demonstrated, and that tends to have a more long-lasting effect. For example, if a lot of folks went and get -- bought 4K TVs, well, I could get used it. But then a lot of content that's more day-to-day, going forward, you can imagine using that kind of capability, and that creates a lot more traffic and more business for Akamai.

And as you can imagine, we're doing deployments in the U.S., outside the U.S. And as we talked about in 2015, we did begin to forward-build for what we thought was going to be, the potential of an over-the-top offering. And so you can think of it as the network -- we can build the network out 3 to 6 months in advance, and so we've built that out. It's fair to say we haven't monetized that here in the near term, and you'll grow into that here in 2016. So we spent a little bit more the percent of revenue in 2015 than we normally do. We normally spend kind of, call it, 8%, 8.5% of revenue on network CapEx, and we spent about 10% of revenue on network CapEx. But that's above our model. We think the model is more in the kind of 8%, 8.5% range. And we'll probably be back at those levels in 2016. And as Tom mentioned around what's going to reaccelerate media, I think we talked about what those things are. I think there's significant opportunity for growth in media outside these 2 accounts. We do believe one catalyst for growth in the media businesses is that more and more premium content moves online, it's poised to push a lot more traffic online, and we believe that we're in a good position to benefit from that when that happens."

I think you look back 4 or 5 years ago, most of the world's major carriers had some kind of DIY effort to build their own CDN to compete with Akamai. Maybe they've bought a lot of equipment from one of the big box manufacturers. And today, most of the world's major carriers are pretty much standardizing on Akamai. Obviously, Verizon, an exception, they're having purchase EdgeCast we compete with as I've said Verizon still a very large reseller for Akamai. Level 3, of course, competes, always have. The list is not long in terms of the carriers. The cloud providers, some of them partner with us, some of them have competing services. But we're not seeing erosion due to competition.

Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $579 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our revenue overachievement compared to guidance was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services, as well as a strong holiday commerce season.
Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.72 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit in the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
We also had very strong cash generation in the fourth quarter with free cash flow of $139 million. Our fourth quarter results capped off another excellent year for Akamai. In 2015, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% in constant currency over an outstanding 2014. As a result, Akamai is now one of only 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue.
Our Performance and Security Solutions topped $1 billion in revenue in 2015, making this our largest solution category. Contributing to that result were our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year and now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. We continued to be very profitable in 2015, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million or $2.52 per diluted share, up 6% over 2014 in constant currency.
I believe our excellent 2015 financial performance demonstrates that our business is strong, growing and highly profitable, validating our comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
In support of this strategy, we are laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
Security, in particular, is a pervasive concern for customers across all verticals and geographies, and it is a tremendous growth opportunity for Akamai. In addition to world-class protection, our unique cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages, such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of Web infrastructures and enhanced performance for Web applications.
When deploying Akamai's security solutions, there is no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever-changing threats. Our cloud security services are designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy a known standard set of security protection across all of their websites, regardless of how or where they are hosted. And unlike traditional approaches to security which can slow down performance, Akamai security solutions have been shown to actually improve performance. This means that Akamai solutions can be used in an always-on proactive mode, which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications.
Our Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of our security data. With our unique global platform, Akamai is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. We process this data using real-time behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve our level of protection. We are also using this data to provide advanced services, such as Client Reputation which we launched late last year, and Bot Manager which we plan to introduce at the upcoming RSA Conference later this month.
As we look forward, we plan to expand our suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. Our first offering in this area is scheduled to be released later this year, and it will make use of our successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data. 
Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, our AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for our enterprise customers, we plan to substantially expand the addressable market for our security solutions. In the long run, we believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud could exceed our current market for protecting websites and applications.
We are also very excited about the opportunity for growth in our media business. Our Media Delivery Solutions generated nearly $1 billion of revenue in 2015 and with strong profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, the growth rate of our media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that we receive from a few very large customers. 
Over the last few years, our largest 2 customers in particular have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect these 2 accounts to still be our largest media customers and that they will contribute about 6% of our overall revenue. This 7-point change in contribution results from their increased do-it-yourself or DIY efforts, and it is the main reason we anticipate a lower year-over-year revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters. It is important to note that the revenue growth from the rest of our customer base remains strong. In addition, we believe that we will exit 2016 with a much more diversified revenue base that will be less subject to future changes in our largest accounts.
More importantly, as more video moves online, I believe that there is the opportunity for substantial future growth in our media business, even in the top few accounts where DIY is currently a factor. When performance matters, even the biggest media companies turn to Akamai. That's because it is very hard to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security at an affordable price point.
Our many advantages over alternative solutions include: our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle-mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users; our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike; and our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale while also lowering costs.
It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase. But as OTT grows, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with our ability to deliver broadcast level quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to cover one last item. Today, we announced an evolution of our organizational structure designed to help us better serve our customers and further accelerate growth by more tightly aligning our teams that build products with those that work day-to-day with our world-class customers. We've made great strides in diversifying our product portfolio in recent years, delivering record sales and profitability. And as we close out another excellent year, I believe that our media and Web performance and security businesses are now at the scale where a transition to this type of customer and solution-centric organization makes sense. This change will become effective in Q2, does not involve layoffs and will not be disruptive for our customers. Indeed, I am looking forward to Akamai becoming even more responsive to our customers' needs and bringing innovative solutions to market at an even faster pace.
In summary, I see a very bright and exciting future for Akamai. Our rapidly growing security business has a rich collection of new products in the pipeline. We are well positioned to benefit from the potential of very large volumes of video traffic moving online. We are well ahead of the field when it comes to improving website and application performance, especially for mobile devices. And we are just beginning to tap into an enterprise security and networking market that could someday be larger than the current market for our Web services. This is why, in addition to the 3-year billion dollar share repurchase program recently authorized by our Board of Directors, I plan to enter into a personal 10b5-1 plan to purchase $10 million worth of Akamai stock over the next 6 months. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?"
24522,321833408,929885,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Re",1675,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $286 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 19% on a constant currency basis and was the sole driver of our revenue overachievement. Our Web Performance business benefited from a stronger-than-expected online holiday season. And we continue to see strong growth and demand for our cloud security offerings across all 3 geographies. Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $73 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 50% on a constant currency basis. Exiting 2015, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $300 million.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $247 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the moderation in media revenue growth rates was driven by the impact of DIY efforts in our largest 2 media accounts. However, the rest of our media business grew over 10% compared to a very strong Q4 of 2014.
Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year or up 21% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $163 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant-currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact of -- on revenue of nearly $14 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continued to see solid growth in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $416 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our 2 largest media accounts reside in the U.S. and heavily weighed on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these 2 accounts, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the U.S. business. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q4. 
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q3, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67% consistent with the prior quarter, down 3 points from the same period last year and about 1 point higher than our guidance due to the revenue overachievement.
GAAP operating expenses were $263 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $211 million, up $7 million from Q3 levels and at the higher end of our guidance. We continue to balance investments in the business with the near-term moderation in revenue growth rates. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, up $16 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, down 2 points from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $80 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, up $5 million from Q3 levels and slightly above our guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $168 million, up $11 million from Q3 and down $7 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels and down 4 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the fourth quarter was about $3 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88 million or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in December, which was not included in our guidance. 
Without the benefit of the R&D tax credit, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $32 million based on an effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on an effective tax rate of 24% and coming in about 6 points lower than our guidance range. Again, due to the R&D tax credit. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 180 million shares, consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance.
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $89 million and slightly above our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $139 million in the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. 
During the quarter, we spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. For the year, we spent $300 million, buying back 4.5 million shares. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program running from now until the end of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2015 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to Q1, as a result of the lower volume from our top 2 accounts and normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality patterns, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $554 million to $570 million. At the midpoint of this range, revenue growth would be 8% adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. 
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $1 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65% to 66%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $201 million to $206 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained, long-term growth and scale.
Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging in prior calls, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. But as a reminder, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $71 million to $73 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 178 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.
In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 7.

So just to be clear that the -- the 13% references, on average, what we've received from these top 2 customers, so it wasn't exactly the percentage of the business that we had in the fourth quarter. So this has been gliding down slowly for the company. And as we said, that we expect next year it will be roughly 6%. It could be a little bit more than that. It could be a little bit less than that depending upon, obviously, traffic volumes. But we're very, very pleased with the performance, in general, of our media business. That our media business outside these 2 customers grew 10% is very, very healthy. I would say that these customers have been doing DIY for a while. And they do serve a fair amount of their traffic themselves. So depending upon traffic volumes for their businesses, we'll serve more or less traffic. But I'd say this is kind of, in general, aligned with our expectations. That I think, in particular, what's going to fill this up, I think, you're going to go through a period where as their revenues glide down to roughly 6% of our total revenues for the company, one, we're much more diversified in our portfolio from a customer perspective because there isn't -- customers 3 and 4 and below that are not even nearly close to the size of these customers. And these customers combined are only going to represent 6%. So the revenue concentration is significantly less. There's significant opportunity for growth, as I mentioned, in the media business. That the media business is very healthy in aggregate. We believe that more and more content is going to move online. Video content, in particular, that will fuel growth. We -- our security business grew 54% in 2015. And that -- it was only a few years ago, 4 years ago, that business was just a few million dollars. So to go from a few million dollars 4 years ago to a business now that is -- has an annualized run rate of $300 million, is huge opportunity for growth in security. And there's an opportunity for growth in other aspects of the business as well. So I think there's many pillars of growth that we think will fuel the company, media, security, Web performance and some of the new emerging areas that Tom outlined."

Now when I talk about the grand challenge is the beginning, there, I'm talking more about a business that we're just beginning to get into. And that is focused on the enterprise network, how an enterprise communicates with employees and branch offices, how you manage enterprise security to protect employees from phishing attacks or malware that gets in and steals corporate e-mails and then exfiltrates that data. We're not really doing that yet today, but that's where we are headed. We had our first, really, toe in the water there in partnerships with Riverbed and Cisco. And we've recently announced partnerships with a couple of major European carriers, Orange and T-Systems. But there's going to be a lot of focus as we move forward on developing capabilities for the enterprise network.

Even years, you have more of those events, and they tend to be better years for our media business. And perhaps more fundamentally, those events, particularly things like the Olympics, there tends to be changes in the ecosystem: fancier TVs, this Olympics will have a lot of 4K involved and so new technologies get demonstrated, and that tends to have a more long-lasting effect. For example, if a lot of folks went and get -- bought 4K TVs, decided they liked it, got used it. Well then a lot of the content that's more day-to-day, going forward, you can imagine using that kind of capability, and that creates a lot more traffic and more business for Akamai. So I think there is a more modest, short-term impact. And yes, we do go get -- make sure we have capacity and sign up deals for all these events. That is good for the media business.

And seasonally, if you have a good online commerce season, the web acceleration business will do well. So season -- and we had a good online commerce season, which why it grew 11%. That business, admittedly, in years past has grown faster than that. That business has the potential to accelerate and grow faster, but because it's a subscription-oriented business, effectively, deals you book this year tend to be revenue next year. And so I don't think you're going to expect a kind of a significant reacceleration in that business any time soon. I do think that there's significant opportunity. I think that the -- there's work being done by the engineering teams to increase the pace of innovation and start to offer adjacent products and also improve the existing products. So I think there's a lot of potential on that business, but that business has been growing in kind of low double digits. It's been decelerating slightly. It is true that when you have an offering like security that's been growing 50%, was relatively new for the sales force, it's gotten significant mind share, we've gotten significant traction. It has taken a little bit away from the web performance business. But I think there's still good opportunity for that business to grow. And I think it's up to us to execute now."

It's fair to say we haven't monetized that here in the near term, and you'll grow into that here in 2016. So we spent a little bit more as a percent of revenue in 2015 than we normally do. We normally spend kind of, call it, 8%, 8.5% of revenue on network CapEx, and we spent about 10% of revenue on network CapEx. But that's above our model. We think the model is more in the kind of 8%, 8.5% range. And we'll probably be back at those levels in 2016. And as Tom mentioned around what's going to reaccelerate media, I think we talked about what those things are. I think there's significant opportunity for growth in media outside these 2 accounts. We do believe one catalyst for growth in the media businesses is as more and more premium content moves online, it's poised to push a lot more traffic online, and we believe that we're in a good position to benefit from that when that happens."

I think you look back 4 or 5 years ago, most of the world's major carriers had some kind of DIY effort to build their own CDN to compete with Akamai. Maybe they bought a lot of equipment from one of the big box manufacturers. And today, most of the world's major carriers are pretty much standardizing on Akamai. Obviously, Verizon, an exception, their having purchase EdgeCast. So we compete with that. That said, Verizon still a very large reseller for Akamai. Level 3, of course, competes, always has. But the list is not long in terms of the carriers. The cloud providers, some of them partner with us, some of them have competing services. But we're not seeing erosion due to competition. We got 2 large customers that have built out more of their own internal effort. We have not lost business to competitors there. So I think we're very -- in a very good position on the competitive front."

Revenue in the first quarter was $568 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the contribution from our 2 largest customers, revenue in the first quarter was up 15% over Q1 of 2015. Our strong revenue achievement was driven by the continued robust demand for our security services, which grew 47% in constant currency over the first quarter of last year as well as solid performance across all of our major product lines and geographies.
Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.66 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue achievement and our continued focus on efficiency across the company.
Our solid performance in Q1 has gotten us off to an excellent start for the year. I was particularly pleased to see our continued strong execution during the time when we were realigning the company. As a result of the realignment, we now have 3 major divisions: media, web and enterprise and carrier. Each division has its own resources for development, product management, marketing and sales. For example, the media division is developing products focused on video and software delivery, and they manage our customers and prospects in the media, software, social networking and gaming verticals. 
The web division is responsible for developing our web security and application acceleration products, and they manage customers and prospects in verticals such as e-commerce, financial services, Software-as-a-Service and the public sector. The enterprise and carrier division is responsible for developing products for enterprise and carrier networks and enterprise, and they manage our carrier relationships.
Going forward, we will report the revenue for each division in terms of the revenue derived from customers in that division. For continuity purposes, we will also continue to provide the product-based view of revenue that we have historically reported. Jim will provide all of this data for Q1 shortly. But first, I'd like to mention some of the recent highlights from the media and web divisions.
It's been an exciting start to the year for the media division with record-breaking online audiences for major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness. 4 million viewers watched the Super Bowl online this year, up from 2.5 million in 2015. The average bit rate was up 30% to 4.5 megabits per second in 2016, and the average viewing time was up 20% to over 100 minutes.
We also delivered a major golf tournament in the new 4K format a few weeks ago. This is the first time that a major U.S. supporting event has been delivered in 4K online. The quality levels were extraordinary. Using our Octoshape client technology, we delivered an average bit rate of 13 megabits per second with a re-buffering rate of less than 1%, showing once again Akamai's ability to deliver broadcast-quality content reliably and securely.
The excellent end-user experience that we are providing with our advanced video delivery capabilities was a major topic of discussion at the recent National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB, show. That's because the ability to deliver high-quality video and scale is critical to the development of over the top, or OTT, services. A common theme in my conversations with many of the world's leading broadcasters and media companies at the show was that they greatly value our ability to provide such high quality and scale and to do so with a very high level of reliability.
It is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security. That's because of our unique approach of streaming content to our global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle-mile peering points resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end-users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is desired by viewers and broadcasters alike. Our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale, are also lower in cost. And our new 24/7 broadcast operations control center, or BOCC, capability for end-to-end monitoring on quality and faster solution of performance issues. I'm pleased to report that our bot is already receiving national accolades for the level of service that it can provide to our broadcast customers. At NAB, the bot was elected as TV Technology's Best of Show towards design, features, cost efficiency and performance. The bot also won Streaming Media's best of NAB 2016, one of only 6 awards the publication presented from among the 1600-plus exhibitors at the show.
Of course, it's hard to predict how fast the OTT market will grow, but we believe that we are very well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
There were also some exciting developments to report from our web division. Most notably, our new bot manager service became generally available earlier this month. bot manager identifies over 1200 types of BOCCs and enables our customers to customize their response to requests based on the bot type. For example, one of our government customers recently deployed Bot Manager to thwart malicious entities that were checking on the validity of stall and account names and passports. Using Bot Manager, they were able to automatically report passwords as being invalid when we detected that a bot was making the request instead of human, thereby, preventing a fraudulent use of stolen identities.
I'm also pleased to report that we now have over 1,000 Ion customers. As you may recall, we launched Ion a little over 3 years ago, and it has since become the leading solution for accelerating websites and applications online. Ion is particularly well-suited for accelerating mobile apps and content being delivered to mobile devices. This is important because the mobile environment is often much slower than the desktop environment. Users expect mobile devices to be fast, and over half of all transactions on the Akamai platform now come from mobile devices.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to emphasize that although we have a new divisional structure, Akamai's goal remains the same as it has always been: to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. And we are still laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance from websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
We believe that we will continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds such as the increasing amount of video game consumed online, the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the growing need for cloud-based security solutions and the continued migration of enterprise applications to the cloud, and we are continuing to invest in the growth of the business. I believe that our new divisional structure will enable us to be even more responsive to our customers' needs and to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace than before. 
In summary, Akamai is off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm very excited about the substantial opportunities for growth that lie ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?"
24522,329998812,963446,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit at March, we are now managing the business with our new division structure.

As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit at March, we are now managing the business with our new division structure. In an effort to make this transition as clear and transparent as possible, in addition to providing our results through this new division lens, we will continue to provide you with our financial results by the solution categories we have historically shared. 
Looking at the top line performance, Akamai had a strong first quarter and is off to a good start in 2016.
Q1 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $568 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 9% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, and growth outside of our top 2 customers continue to be strong, up 15% in constant currency.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $316 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product line, and we continue to see significant growth and demand for our Cloud Security offerings. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $81 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 47% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers and being recognized in the marketplace. Our Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $206 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, media revenues continue to be impacted by DIY efforts in 2 of our largest media customers. However, the rest of our media business grew over 11% compared to a very strong Q1 of 2015.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise professional class services globally. 
Turning now to our new division view. As we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a new division structure, which integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions to focus on the company's media, web and enterprise and carrier products and customers. This new customer-aligned structure is designed to create tighter alignment and integration between customer requirements and product innovation while increasing the ease of deleveraging Akamai's services and is intended to help us better serve our customers and accelerate growth. Under this new division construct, revenue from our media division was $292 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis. The media division is impacted by the continued DIY efforts of our 2 largest customers, media customers that I mentioned earlier. Revenue growth for the media division customers outside of the top 2 was a healthy 11%. Revenue from the web division was $264 million, up 18% year-over-year. We have continued to see solid growth in this customer base but particularly strong security growth of 51% year-over-year in constant currency. Lastly, revenue from the emerging enterprise and carrier division was $12 million in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year. To be helpful, as we migrate to this new division reporting lens, we will continue to report the former solution category view through the balance of 2016 and even though our security revenue will now be embedded within each of the 3 division revenue results, we will continue to break out total security revenue separately. You will find all of these revenue results detailed in today's press release and on our Investor Relations website.
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 30% of total revenue in Q1, up 2 points from Q4. International revenue was $170 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year or up 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and was roughly neutral on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography.
Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 2% year-over-year. As we have shared with you previously, our 2 largest media customers reside in the U.S. and continued to weigh heavily on domestic revenues. Outside of these 2 customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. 
Moving on to cost. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66%, down 1 point from the prior quarter, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $259 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results included items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A particular note in the quarter, we recorded $7 million in nonrecurring restructuring charges for severance and impairment related to the organization realignment. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $201 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and at the low end of our guidance. As always, we'll strive to balance investments in the business to align with the expected near-term moderation in revenue growth rates. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $234 million, down $4 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines Q4 to Q1 and up $11 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $81 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $17 million, consistent with Q4 levels and slightly below our guidance, due to the timing of network deployments.
Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $164 million, down $4 million from Q4 and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q4 levels and down 2 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance, given the strong revenue attainment and cost efficiencies mentioned earlier.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the first quarter was $3 million consistent with Q4 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt is roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $75 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $118 [ph] million or $0.66 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, our better-than-expected earnings fueled by higher revenues and continued efficiencies in the business. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $38 million based on an effective tax rate of 33.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 178 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q4 levels from our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance.
Now I'll give you some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 60 days, up 1 day from Q4 levels. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $85 million and at the low end of our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx level also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continue to be strong. Free cash flow was $108 million in the first quarter or 19% of revenue, a very strong result considering Q1 is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash was approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $109 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2018. We have approximately $960 million remaining on that authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders, depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead, we are projecting revenue from our top 2 customers to decline in Q2 and possibly the second half of the year. As such, we are expecting slightly less sequential growth in the second quarter than we have historically seen. We expect Q2 revenues in the range of $566 million to $582 million. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q2 revenue of roughly $3 million sequentially and less than $1 million compared to Q2 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $211 million. As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount addition and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations, but we are continuing to make good prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in all these other items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40%, and as I continue to we will strive to operate the company at a 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future.  Of course, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins in this range will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity and anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $73 million to $75 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 176 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $98 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. As always, we will strive to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives. 
In closing, Q1 was a solid start to 2016, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our long-term plans.
Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"

So I think, as you look over time, every year were able to offer significant cost reductions on a per bit basis to our customers. So over 5 years, the savings are really quite substantial. We are very competitive when it comes to pricing for large-traffic customers, and I think we are very competitive with not only the other CDNs out there but also the do-it-yourself effort that some of our largest customers have tried to engage in. And you see this where some of our large customers have do-it-yourself efforts in the past and then after a few years discover that Akamai is a lot more effective at it and charges them less than their internal efforts cost them, and so then our traffic grows again even though they've got do-it-yourself efforts."

And as I said earlier that if we see demand that we need to do more network deployment, we'll do that. I don't want the signal something and then later on maybe a little bit lower than that.

You can't defend yourself by buying boxes and putting them in your data center. You can't even defend yourself by buying a clean pipe from a carrier simply because of the scale of the attacks. And that's why Akamai has been uniquely able to defend a lot of the world's major enterprises against the largest attacks out there. In addition, we're able to defend against the attacks that try to defaced or corrupt a website, change the content in a way to embarrass the website owner and also to we can defend against the attacks we try to steal data from the web application like a credit card or information about the transaction. Going forward, with our enterprise and carrier division, we are developing products that will protect enterprise employees. For example, for phishing, malware kinds of attacks or enterprisare enterprise data ex filtration attacks, so it's a very exciting future potential for us in security."

You're right, in some cases, they're smaller for the reasons that you've outlined.

Video delivery is a driver of traffic volumes. Social media is a driver of traffic volume. Gaming is a driver of traffic volume. So software download activity is kind of but one of several growth drivers on traffic, and you'll see variability in software traffic volumes based on frequency and size. And what was your second question?"

So I guess, that gets the other thing, it's -- there's file sizes and software downloads, but there also seems improvements in encoding that might be impacting some of the file sizes of video that used to get transferred versus what maybe they were 2 years ago so -- and so that's one thing that I guess I wonder if you have a comment on. And then the other would be, clearly, we need everyone to ask about these top 2 customers and the trajectory in the back half of the year. I guess what I'm interested in is 12 to 18 months ago, there was -- there was concerns over DIY and kind of talked about that you just get a better experience, which you do, using Akamai, so unlikely that these guys would make such bold steps to bring as much in-house. I guess there's some concern that we get from people that what's to stop the third and fourth largest customers that you have now from embarking down the same path. They're just so far away from having a level of traffic at the top 2 that it's just not a viable opportunity for them."

The first one is there's always improvements in video compression technology, and I think the important thing to look at is the increase in bit rate because you need a higher quality picture combined with a decrease in bit rate because you got that better compression, and you mentioned a 20% improvement in compression. That pales in comparison to the increasing bit rates that we're seeing because people want a higher-quality picture. In fact, if you take the combination state-of-the-art quality picture combined with state-of-the-art compression and the CAGR of that net, for years, it was growing at a slower rate, and now we're seeing it actually accelerate onto the cumulative growth rate. So taking the state-of-the-art compression combined with typical bit rates that people are watching, actually, it's growing per video watch and growing now at a faster rate than it has in the past. And on top of that, you have people watching longer and more content moving online, and so the net effect is actually much faster growth rate in aggregate traffic being consumed for video online. And you can take an example the Super Bowl that we gave, and we're seeing that kind of growth pretty much across the board in video. Now to your third question about DIY, it could not go to the third and fourth largest customers, well, in fact our third and fourth largest customers have DIY for over a decade. And in fact, a lot of them actually sells a CDN service, yet they still use us to deliver their content for the website, and they use us to deliver their videos. And they have a very large website and a very large video business and use us to deliver that despite the fact that they actually operate a CDN service and have the last decade. The other provider uses us as well despite in-house efforts they've run over the years. And in fact, our share of their business has increased during the same period and because they see the quality difference and the class difference. DIY can seem like a good idea at the time, maybe they can save some money bringing it in-house or they think that but then after a few years, they discover that, ""Oh my goodness, Akamai is doing it at a lot less cost and a lot better performance,"" so our share has actually increased in the third and fourth largest customers. And there's not too many past the top 4 that actually can even afford to think about doing their own delivery. So we're experiencing some loss in DIY in our top 2 accounts now, and I think the time frame when that happens is bound, as Jim said, the impact that will have in our business and then you see our cumulative growth rates return to where the norm of the rest of the business is."

What are the applications that are easier to bring in-house and can you, in that context, talk about OTT and does it have characteristics of that make it very difficult to achieve in-house?"

On the enterprise business, I think, the success metrics would be around the products of that process of bringing to market. So for enterprise security, that would be our recursive DNS service, which will be designed to block malware, phishing attacks and blocking exfiltration of sensitive data from the enterprise. And we're launching that product later this year, and so you would look to see and will be looking to see the adoption rate of that capability. We'll also be bringing to market early next year our cloud-connected branch product, which is enterprise networking combined with a secure Web Gateway functionality. And that's designed to make the enterprise network scale in a much better performing way and a much more cost effective manner, and so we would be looking to see the adoption rates there. I think the potential in both of those areas is very large, but you're right, we're at the very early stages, and we have to see how successful we are with those products in the market next year. In terms of DIY and the top 2 accounts, I think you would look at things that are easier to deliver, for example, software may be short-form VOD videos on-demand but short form. It's not OTT. When I think as we think about OTT, I don't see that as a DIY kind of thing today. It is much harder to do particularly in the line and linear formats, particularly in a higher quality that you want to have when subscribers are actually paying to view the content. That's a whole different game, and there's a lot you have to do with -- today, Akamai is in a great position to provide that quality. Just one example being the first broadcast of 4K, but in general, sustaining very high bit rates, very lower buffer rates at scale, and that's what you need for OTT delivery, and that's why a lot of the companies that are doing OTT are turning to Akamai to do it."

Excluding t",1282,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q1 was a very solid quarter for Akamai in both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the first quarter was $568 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the contribution from our 2 largest customers, revenue in the first quarter was up 15% over Q1 of 2015. Our strong revenue achievement was driven by the continued robust demand for our security services, which grew 47% in constant currency over the first quarter of last year as well as solid performance across all of our major product lines and geographies.
Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.66 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue achievement and our continued focus on efficiency across the company.
Our solid performance in Q1 has gotten us off to an excellent start for the year. I was particularly pleased to see our continued strong execution during the time when we were realigning the company. As a result of the realignment, we now have 3 major divisions: media, web and enterprise and carrier. Each division has its own resources for development, product management, marketing and sales. For example, the Media Division is developing products focused on video and software delivery, and they manage our customers and prospects in the media, software, social networking and gaming verticals. The Web Division is responsible for developing our web security and application acceleration products, and they manage customers and prospects in verticals such as ecommerce, financial services, Software-as-a-Service and the public sector. The Enterprise and Carrier Division is responsible for developing products for enterprise and carrier networks and enterprise security, and they manage our carrier relationships.
Going forward, we will report the revenue for each division in terms of the revenue derived from customers in that division. For continuity purposes, we will also continue to provide the product-based view of revenue that we have historically reported. Jim will provide all of this data for Q1 shortly. But first, I'd like to mention some of the recent highlights from the Media and Web Divisions.
It's been an exciting start to the year for the Media Division with record-breaking online audiences for major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness. 4 million viewers watched the Super Bowl online this year, up from 2.5 million in 2015. The average bitrate was up 30% to 4.5 megabits per second in 2016, and the average viewing time was up 20% to over 100 minutes.
We also delivered a major golf tournament in the new 4K format a few weeks ago. This was the first time that a major U.S. sporting event has been delivered in 4K online. The quality levels were extraordinary. Using our Octoshape client technology, we delivered an average bitrate of 13 megabits per second with a rebuffering rate of less than 1%, showing once again, Akamai's ability to deliver broadcast-quality content reliably and securely.
The excellent end-user experience that we are providing with our advanced video delivery capabilities was a major topic of discussion at the recent National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB, show. That's because the ability to deliver high-quality video at scale is critical to the enablement of over-the-top, or OTT, services. A common theme in my conversations with many of the world's leading broadcasters and media companies at the show was that they greatly value our ability to provide such high quality and scale and to do so with a very high level of reliability.
It is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security. That's because of our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle-mile peering points resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users; our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is desired by viewers and broadcasters alike; our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale, are also lowering cost; and our new 24/7 Broadcast Operations Control Center, or BOCC, capability for end-to-end monitoring on quality and fast resolution of performance issues. I'm pleased to report that our BOCC is already receiving national accolades for the level of service that it can provide to our broadcast customers. At NAB, the BOCC was elected as TV Technology's Best of Show towards design, features, cost efficiency and performance. The BOCC also won Streaming Media's best of NAB 2016, one of only 6 awards the publication presented from among the 1,600-plus exhibitors at the show.
Of course, it's hard to predict how fast the OTT market will grow, but we believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
There are also some exciting developments to report from our Web Division. Most notably, our new Bot Manager service became generally available earlier this month. Bot Manager identifies over 1,200 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the bot type. For example, one of our government customers recently deployed Bot Manager to thwart malicious entities that were checking on the validity of stolen account names and passwords. Using Bot Manager, they were able to automatically report passwords as being invalid when we detected that a bot was making the request instead of a human, thereby, preventing a fraudulent use of stolen identities.
I'm also pleased to report that we now have over 1,000 Ion customers. As you may recall, we launched Ion a little over 3 years ago, and it has since become the leading solution for accelerating websites and applications online. Ion is particularly well suited for accelerating mobile apps and content being delivered to mobile devices. This is important because the mobile environment is often much slower than the desktop environment. Users expect mobile devices to be fast, and over half of all transactions on the Akamai platform now come from mobile devices.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to emphasize that although we have a new divisional structure, Akamai's goal remains the same as it has always been: to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. And we are still laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance from websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
We believe that we will continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds such as the increasing amount of video being consumed online, the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the growing need for cloud-based security solutions and the continued migration of enterprise applications to the cloud, and we are continuing to invest in the growth of the business. I believe that our new divisional structure will enable us to be even more responsive to our customers' needs and to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace than before.
In summary, Akamai is off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm very excited about the substantial opportunities for growth that lie ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?"
24522,329998812,963648,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure.

As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure. In an effort to make this transition as clear and transparent as possible, in addition to providing our results through this new division lens, we will continue to provide you with our financial results by the solution categories we have historically shared.
Looking at the top line performance, Akamai had a strong first quarter and is off to a good start in 2016. Q1 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $568 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 9% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, and growth outside of our top 2 customers continued to be strong, up 15% in constant currency.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $316 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product line, and we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $81 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 47% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers and being recognized in the marketplace. Our Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $206 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, media revenues continued to be impacted by DIY efforts in 2 of our largest media customers. However, the rest of our media business grew over 11% compared to a very strong Q1 of 2015.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise-class professional services globally.
Turning now to our new division view. As we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a new division structure, which integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions to focus on the company's media, web and enterprise and carrier products end customers. This new customer-aligned structure is designed to create tighter alignment and integration between customer requirements and product innovation while increasing the ease of leveraging Akamai's services and is intended to help us better serve our customers and accelerate growth. Under this new division construct, revenue from our Media Division was $292 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis. The Media Division is impacted by the continued DIY efforts of our 2 largest customers, media customer, that I mentioned earlier. Revenue growth for the Media Division customers outside of the top 2 was a healthy 11%. 
Revenue from the Web Division was $264 million, up 18% year-over-year. We have continued to see solid growth in this customer base with particularly strong security growth of 51% year-over-year in constant currency.
Lastly, revenue from the emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division was $12 million in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year. To be helpful, as we migrate to this new division reporting lens, we will continue to report the former solution category view through the balance of 2016. And even though our security revenue will now be embedded within each of the 3 division's revenue results, we will continue to break out total security revenue separately. You will find all of these revenue results detailed in today's press release and on our Investor Relations website.
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 30% of total revenue in Q1, up 2 points from Q4. International revenue was $170 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year or up 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and was roughly neutral on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography.
Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 2% year-over-year. As we have shared with you previously, our 2 largest media customers reside in the U.S. and continued to weigh heavily on domestic revenues. Outside of these 2 customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from the prior quarter, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $259 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A particular note in the quarter, we recorded $7 million in nonrecurring restructuring charges for severance and impairments related to the organization realignment. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $201 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and at the low end of our guidance. As always, we will strive to balance investments in the business to align with the expected near-term moderation in revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $234 million, down $4 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines Q4 to Q1 and up $11 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $81 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, consistent with Q4 levels and slightly below our guidance, due to the timing of network deployments.
Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $164 million, down $4 million from Q4 and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q4 levels and down 2 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance, given the strong revenue attainment and cost efficiencies mentioned earlier.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the first quarter was $3 million, consistent with Q4 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt is roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expenses is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $75 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.66 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues and continued efficiencies in the business.
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $38 million based on an effective tax rate of 33.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 178 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q4 levels from our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance.
Now I'll give you some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 60 days, up 1 day from Q4 levels. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $85 million and at the low end of our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $108 million in the first quarter or 19% of revenue, a very strong result considering Q1 is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $109 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2018. We have approximately $960 million remaining on that authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead, we are projecting revenue from our top 2 customers to decline in Q2 and possibly the second half of the year. As such, we are expecting slightly less sequential growth in the second quarter than we have historically seen. We expect Q2 revenues in the range of $566 million to $582 million. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q2 revenue of roughly $3 million sequentially and less than $1 million compared to Q2 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 6 -- 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $211 million.
As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations, but we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in all these other items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I continue the message, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. Of course, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins in this range will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity and anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $73 million to $75 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 176 million shares.
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $98 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. As always, we will strive to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.
In closing, Q1 was a solid start to 2016, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our long-term plans.
Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"

Many years of high growth in traffic volumes, along with price breaks that you've been passing along, but how much has the company been able to cost reduce traffic delivery over the years?

And how this -- do you think this compares to some of the generic CDN or some of the do-it-yourself efforts that you've seen over this time frame?

To the first question, we put a lot of effort in R&D to reduce our internal cost per bit, to deliver more bits per second per CPU, more bits per second per square foot of co-lo, per kilowatt of power, and then we pass on those savings to our customers. So I think, as you look over time, every year, we're able to offer significant cost reductions on a per bit basis to our customers. So over 5 years, the savings are really quite substantial. We are very competitive when it comes to pricing for large-traffic customers, and I think we are very competitive with not only the other CDNs out there but also the do-it-yourself effort that some of our largest customers have tried to engage in. And you see this where some of our large customers have had do-it-yourself efforts in the past, and then after a few years, discovered that, wow, Akamai is a lot more effective at it and charges them less than their internal efforts cost them. And so then, our traffic grows again even though they've got do-it-yourself efforts."

So other than profitability, collections tends to be -- receivable collections tends to be the kind of driver from quarter-to-quarter if you see upticks or downticks. Also, CapEx happens to have variability from quarter-to-quarter, but I would expect that this will probably still remain our seasonally lowest quarter, but it all depends upon capital expenditures. And as I said earlier that if we see demand that we need to do more network deployment, we'll do that. So I don't want to signal something and then later on if we maybe a little bit lower than that. It really depends upon CapEx investments, but I'd say, based on our Carolina site, it probably will be the lowest seasonal quarter this year as well."

I think what we're saying is that we're not 100% sure on the back half of the year, so we're being a little cautious in our projections that it could decline further. There are things that could stabilize it. There are things beyond that, depending upon different features and capability for these 2 customers that could cause it to grow as well. But I'd say what we're trying to provide you is the level of cautiousness, and that's the way we're looking at it internally."

You're right that, in some cases, they're smaller for the reasons that you outlined. In some cases, they happen more frequently, so they're smaller but happen more frequently. And it's not just software updates that are drivers of traffic volumes. Video delivery is a driver of traffic volumes. Social media is a driver of traffic volumes. Gaming is a driver of traffic volumes. So software download activity is kind of but one of several growth drivers on traffic, and you'll see variability in software traffic volumes based on frequency and size. And what was your second question?"

So I guess that gets the other thing. It's -- there's file sizes and software downloads, but there also seems improvements in encoding that might be impacting some of the file sizes of video that used to get transferred versus what they -- versus what maybe they were 2 years ago so -- and so that's one thing that I guess I wonder if you have a comment on. And then the other would be, I mean, clearly, we -- everyone want to ask about these top 2 customers and the trajectory in the back half of the year. I guess what I'm interested in is 12 to 18 months ago, there was concerns over DIY and it was always kind of talked about that you just get a better experience, which you do, using Akamai, so unlikely that these guys would make such bold steps to bring as much in-house. I guess there's some concern that we get from people that what's to stop the third and fourth largest customers that you have now from embarking down the same path. Are they just so far away from having the level of traffic at the top 2 that it's just not a viable opportunity for them?"

Let me take those 2 questions. The first one is, there's always improvements in video compression technology, and I think the important thing to look at is the increase in bitrate because you need a higher-quality picture combined with the decrease in bitrate because you got better compression. And you mentioned a 20% improvement in compression. That pales in comparison to the increasing bitrates that we're seeing because people want a higher-quality picture. In fact, if you take the combination of -- state-of-the-art quality picture combined with state-of-the-art compression, the -- and the CAGR of that net, for years, it was growing but at a slower rate, and now we're seeing it actually accelerate on the cumulative growth rate. So taking the state-of-the-art compression combined with typical bitrates that people are watching, actually, it's growing per minute of video watch and growing now at a faster rate than it has in the past. And on top of that, you have people watching longer and more content moving online, and so the net effect is actually much faster growth rate in aggregate traffic being consumed for video online. And you can take on this example, the Super Bowl stats that we gave, and we're seeing that kind of growth pretty much across the board in video. Now to your third question about DIY, and well, can that go to the third and fourth largest customers? Well, in fact, our third and fourth largest customers have had DIY for over a decade. And in fact, one lot of them actually sells a CDN service, yet they still use us to deliver their content for their website, and they use us to deliver their videos. And they have a very large website and a very large video business, and they use us to deliver that despite the fact that they actually operate a CDN service and have the last decade. The other provider uses us as well despite in-house efforts they've run over the years. And in fact, our share of their business has increased during the same period and -- because they see the quality difference and the class difference. DIY can seem like a good idea at the time, maybe they can save some money bringing it in-house or they think that, but then after a few years, they discover that, ""Oh, my goodness. Akamai is doing it with a lot less cost and with a lot better performance."" And so our share has actually increased in the third and fourth largest customers. And there's not too many past the top 4 that actually can even afford to think about doing their own delivery. So yes, we're experiencing some -- loss to DIY in our top 2 accounts now. I think the time frame for when that happens is bounded, as Jim says, the impact it'll have on our business, and then you'll see our cumulative growth rates return to where the norm of the rest of the business is."

Obviously, you've been working on for a couple of years, at least in my opinion, should have been probably could have been bigger than what we had thought a couple of years back. So if you can elaborate on that. And the second question is, obviously, we're seeing DIY happening at a couple of customers. What are the applications that are easy to kind of bring in-house?

On the enterprise business, I think, the success metrics would be around the products that we're -- the process of bringing to market. So for enterprise security, that would be our recursive DNS service, which will be designed to block malware, phishing attacks and blocking exfiltration of sensitive data from the enterprise. And we're launching that product later this year, and so you would look to see, and we'll be looking to see, the adoption rate of that capability. We'll also be bringing to market early next year our cloud-connected branch product, which is enterprise networking combined with a secure web gateway functionality. And that's designed to make the enterprise network scale in a much better performing way and in a much more cost-effective manner. And so we would be looking to see the adoption rates there. I think the potential in both of those areas is very large. But you're right, we're at the very early stages, and we have to see how successful we are with those products in the market next year. In terms of DIY and the top 2 accounts, I think you would look at things that are easier to deliver, for example, software, may be short-form VOD, videos on-demand, but short form. It's not OTT. And I think as you think about OTT, I don't see that as a DIY kind of thing today. It is much harder to do, particularly in the live and linear formats, particularly in a higher quality that you want to have when subscribers are actually paying to view the content. That's a whole different game. And there's a lot you have to do, and today, Akamai is in a great position to provide that quality. Just one example, being the first broadcast of 4K, but in general, sustaining very high bitrates, very lower rebuffer rates at scale, and that's what you need for OTT delivery. And that's why a lot of the companies that are doing OTT are turning to Akamai to do it."

Excluding t",1283,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q1 was a very solid quarter for Akamai in both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the first quarter was $568 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the contribution from our 2 largest customers, revenue in the first quarter was up 15% over Q1 of 2015. Our strong revenue achievement was driven by the continued robust demand for our security services, which grew 47% in constant currency over the first quarter of last year as well as solid performance across all of our major product lines and geographies.
Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.66 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue achievement and our continued focus on efficiency across the company.
Our solid performance in Q1 has gotten us off to an excellent start for the year. I was particularly pleased to see our continued strong execution during the time when we were realigning the company. As a result of the realignment, we now have 3 major divisions: media, web and enterprise and carrier. Each division has its own resources for development, product management, marketing and sales. For example, the Media Division is developing products focused on video and software delivery, and they manage our customers and prospects in the media, software, social networking and gaming verticals. The Web Division is responsible for developing our web security and application acceleration products, and they manage customers and prospects in verticals such as ecommerce, financial services, Software-as-a-Service and the public sector. The Enterprise and Carrier Division is responsible for developing products for enterprise and carrier networks and enterprise security, and they manage our carrier relationships.
Going forward, we will report the revenue for each division in terms of the revenue derived from customers in that division. For continuity purposes, we will also continue to provide the product-based view of revenue that we have historically reported. Jim will provide all of this data for Q1 shortly. But first, I'd like to mention some of the recent highlights from the Media and Web Divisions.
It's been an exciting start to the year for the Media Division with record-breaking online audiences for major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness. 4 million viewers watched the Super Bowl online this year, up from 2.5 million in 2015. The average bitrate was up 30% to 4.5 megabits per second in 2016, and the average viewing time was up 20% to over 100 minutes.
We also delivered a major golf tournament in the new 4K format a few weeks ago. This was the first time that a major U.S. sporting event has been delivered in 4K online. The quality levels were extraordinary. Using our Octoshape client technology, we delivered an average bitrate of 13 megabits per second with a rebuffering rate of less than 1%, showing once again, Akamai's ability to deliver broadcast-quality content reliably and securely.
The excellent end-user experience that we are providing with our advanced video delivery capabilities was a major topic of discussion at the recent National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB, show. That's because the ability to deliver high-quality video at scale is critical to the enablement of over-the-top, or OTT, services. A common theme in my conversations with many of the world's leading broadcasters and media companies at the show was that they greatly value our ability to provide such high quality and scale and to do so with a very high level of reliability.
It is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security. That's because of our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle-mile peering points resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users; our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is desired by viewers and broadcasters alike; our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale, are also lowering cost; and our new 24/7 Broadcast Operations Control Center, or BOCC, capability for end-to-end monitoring of quality and fast resolution of performance issues. I'm pleased to report that our BOCC is already receiving national accolades for the level of service that it can provide to our broadcast customers. At NAB, the BOCC was selected as TV Technology's Best of Show for it's design, features, cost efficiency and performance. The BOCC also won Streaming Media's best of NAB 2016, one of only 6 awards the publication presented from among the 1,600-plus exhibitors at the show.
Of course, it's hard to predict how fast the OTT market will grow, but we believe that we are very well positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
There are also some exciting developments to report from our Web Division. Most notably, our new Bot Manager service became generally available earlier this month. Bot Manager identifies over 1,200 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the bot type. For example, one of our government customers recently deployed Bot Manager to thwart malicious entities that were checking on the validity of stolen account names and passwords. Using Bot Manager, they were able to automatically report passwords as being invalid when we detected that a bot was making the request instead of a human, thereby, preventing a fraudulent use of stolen identities.
I'm also pleased to report that we now have over 1,000 Ion customers. As you may recall, we launched Ion a little over 3 years ago, and it has since become the leading solution for accelerating websites and applications online. Ion is particularly well suited for accelerating mobile apps and content being delivered to mobile devices. This is important because the mobile environment is often much slower than the desktop environment. Users expect mobile devices to be fast, and over half of all transactions on the Akamai platform now come from mobile devices.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to emphasize that although we have a new divisional structure, Akamai's goal remains the same as it has always been: to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. And we are still laser-focused on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.
We believe that we will continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds such as the increasing amount of video being consumed online, the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the growing need for cloud-based security solutions and the continued migration of enterprise applications to the cloud, and we are continuing to invest in the growth of the business. I believe that our new divisional structure will enable us to be even more responsive to our customers' needs and to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace than before.
In summary, Akamai is off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm very excited about the substantial opportunities for growth that lie ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?"
24522,329998812,963697,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure.

As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the Investor Summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure. In an effort to make this transition as clear and transparent as possible, in addition to providing our results through this new division lens, we will continue to provide you with our financial results by the solution categories we have historically shared.
Looking at the top line performance, Akamai had a strong first quarter and is off to a good start in 2016. Q1 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $568 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 9% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, and growth outside of our top 2 customers continued to be strong, up 15% in constant currency.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $316 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines, and we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $81 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 47% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers and being recognized in the marketplace. Our Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $206 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, media revenues continued to be impacted by DIY efforts in 2 of our largest media customers. However, the rest of our media business grew over 11% compared to a very strong Q1 of 2015.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise-class professional services globally.
Turning now to our new division view. As we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a new division structure, which integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions to focus on the company's media, web and enterprise and carrier products end customers. This new customer-aligned structure is designed to create tighter alignment and integration between customer requirements and product innovation while increasing the ease of leveraging Akamai's services and is intended to help us better serve our customers and accelerate growth. Under this new division construct, revenue from our Media Division was $292 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis. The Media Division is impacted by the continued DIY efforts of our 2 largest customers, media customers, that I mentioned earlier. Revenue growth for the Media Division customers outside of the top 2 was a healthy 11%. 
Revenue from the Web Division was $264 million, up 18% year-over-year. We have continued to see solid growth in this customer base with particularly strong security growth of 51% year-over-year in constant currency.
Lastly, revenue from the emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division was $12 million in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year. To be helpful, as we migrate to this new division reporting lens, we will continue to report the former solution category view through the balance of 2016. And even though our security revenue will now be embedded within each of the 3 division's revenue results, we will continue to break out total security revenue separately. You will find all of these revenue results detailed in today's press release and on our Investor Relations website.
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 30% of total revenue in Q1, up 2 points from Q4. International revenue was $170 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year or up 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and was roughly neutral on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography.
Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 2% year-over-year. As we have shared with you previously, our 2 largest media customers reside in the U.S. and continued to weigh heavily on domestic revenues. Outside of these 2 customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from the prior quarter, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $259 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Of particular note in the quarter, we recorded $7 million in nonrecurring restructuring charges for severance and impairments related to the organization realignment. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $201 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and at the low end of our guidance. As always, we will strive to balance investments in the business to align with the expected near-term moderation in revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $234 million, down $4 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines Q4 to Q1 and up $11 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, consistent with Q4 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $81 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, consistent with Q4 levels and slightly below our guidance, due to the timing of network deployments.
Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $164 million, down $4 million from Q4 and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q4 levels and down 2 points from the same period last year and 1 point higher than our guidance, given the strong revenue attainment and cost efficiencies mentioned earlier.
Moving on to the other income and expense items. Interest income for the first quarter was $3 million, consistent with Q4 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt is roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $75 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.66 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues and continued efficiencies in the business.
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $38 million based on an effective tax rate of 33.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 178 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q4 levels from our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance.
Now I'll give you some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 60 days, up 1 day from Q4 levels. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $85 million and at the low end of our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $108 million in the first quarter or 19% of revenue, a very strong result considering Q1 is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $109 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares.
As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2018. We have approximately $960 million remaining on that authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead, we are projecting revenue from our top 2 customers to decline in Q2 and possibly the second half of the year. As such, we are expecting slightly less sequential growth in the second quarter than we have historically seen. We expect Q2 revenues in the range of $566 million to $582 million. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q2 revenue of roughly $3 million sequentially and less than $1 million compared to Q2 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 6 -- 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $211 million.
As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations, but we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in all these other items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I continue the message, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. Of course, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins in this range will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity and anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.
Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $73 million to $75 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 176 million shares.
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $98 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. As always, we will strive to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.
In closing, Q1 was a solid start to 2016, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our long-term plans.
Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"

To the first question, we put a lot of effort in R&D to reduce our internal cost per bit, to deliver more bits per second per CPU, more bits per second per square foot of co-lo, per kilowatt of power, and then we pass on those savings to our customers. So I think, as you look over time, every year, we're able to offer significant cost reductions on a per bit basis to our customers. So over 5 years, the savings are really quite substantial. We are very competitive when it comes to pricing for large-traffic customers, and I think we are very competitive with not only the other CDNs out there but also the do-it-yourself effort that some of our largest customers have tried to engage in. And you see this where some of our large customers have had do-it-yourself efforts in the past, and then after a few years, discovered that, wow, Akamai is a lot more effective at it and charges them less than their internal efforts cost them.

So other than profitability, collections tends to be -- receivable collections tends to be the kind of driver from quarter-to-quarter if you see upticks or downticks. Also, CapEx happens to have variability from quarter-to-quarter, but I would expect that this will probably still remain our seasonally lowest quarter, but it all depends upon capital expenditures. And as I said earlier that if we see demand that we need to do more network deployment, we'll do that. So I don't want to signal something and then later on if we maybe a little bit lower than that. It really depends upon CapEx investments, but I'd say, based on our Carolina site, it probably will be the lowest seasonal quarter this year as well."

So on the guidance that -- I'd say we're probably appropriately being cautious, to be frank, that the -- we have good visibility within the quarter for these top 2 customers. I'd say the visibility beyond the quarter is less, and so what we're trying to do is be cautious in what we're telling you that we certainly expect from Q1 to Q2, as we told you last time, that revenue volumes would decline for these top 2 customers. I think what we're saying is that we're not 100% sure on the back half of the year, so we're being a little cautious in our projections that it could decline further. There are things that could stabilize it. There are things beyond that, depending upon different features and capability for these 2 customers that could cause it to grow as well. But I'd say what we're trying to provide you is the level of cautiousness, and that's the way we're looking at it internally."

From a competitor landscape perspective that there's still kind of broad global competitors that you know who they are, and then there are local competitors in different markets.

As you know, we have dozens of competitors and always have, and we differentiate ourselves based on our level of performance. So if you want your applications to be faster, whether you're on Google, Azure or AWS, you would use Akamai to accelerate those applications. If you want your applications to be secure wherever you have them hosted, you'd use Akamai Kona Site Defender and our Prolexic Routed capabilities, and that will protect you from DDoS attacks and application-layer attacks.

You're right that, in some cases, they're smaller for the reasons that you outlined. In some cases, they happen more frequently, so they're smaller but happen more frequently. And it's not just software updates that are drivers of traffic volumes. Video delivery is a driver of traffic volumes. Social media is a driver of traffic volumes. Gaming is a driver of traffic volumes. So software download activity is kind of but one of several growth drivers on traffic, and you'll see variability in software traffic volumes based on frequency and size. And what was your second question?"

So I guess that gets the other thing. It's -- there's file sizes and software downloads, but there also seems improvements in encoding that might be impacting some of the file sizes of video that used to get transferred versus what they -- versus what maybe they were 2 years ago so -- and so that's one thing that I guess I wonder if you have a comment on. And then the other would be, I mean, clearly, we -- everyone's asked about these top 2 customers and the trajectory in the back half of the year. I guess what I'm interested in is 12 to 18 months ago, there was concerns over DIY and it was always kind of talked about that you just get a better experience, which you do, using Akamai, so unlikely that these guys would make such bold steps to bring as much in-house. I guess there's some concern that we get from people that what's to stop the third and fourth largest customers that you have now from embarking down the same path. Are they just so far away from having the level of traffic as the top 2 that it's just not a viable opportunity for them?"

Let me take those 2 questions. The first one is, there's always improvements in video compression technology, and I think the important thing to look at is the increase in bitrate because you need a higher-quality picture combined with the decrease in bitrate because you've got better compression. And you mentioned a 20% improvement in compression. That pales in comparison to the increasing bitrates that we're seeing because people want a higher-quality picture. In fact, if you take the combination of state-of-the-art quality picture combined with state-of-the-art compression, the -- and the CAGR of that net, for years, it was growing but at a slower rate, and now we're seeing it actually accelerate on the cumulative growth rate. So taking the state-of-the-art compression combined with typical bitrates that people are watching, actually, it's growing per minute of video watched and growing now at a faster rate than it has in the past. And on top of that, you have people watching longer and more content moving online, and so the net effect is actually much faster growth rate in aggregate traffic being consumed for video online. And you can take as an example, the Super Bowl stats that we gave, and we're seeing that kind of growth pretty much across the board in video. Now to your third question about DIY, and well, can that go to the third and fourth largest customers? Well, in fact, our third and fourth largest customers have had DIY for over a decade. And in fact, one of them actually sells a CDN service, yet they still use us to deliver their content for their website, and they use us to deliver their videos. And they have a very large website and a very large video business, and they use us to deliver that despite the fact that they actually operate a CDN service and have the last decade. The other provider uses us as well despite in-house efforts they've run over the years. And in fact, our share of their business has increased during the same period and -- because they see the quality difference and the cost difference. DIY can seem like a good idea at the time, maybe they can save some money bringing it in-house or they think that, but then after a few years, they discover that, ""Oh, my goodness. Akamai is doing it with a lot less cost and with a lot better performance."" And so our share has actually increased in the third and fourth largest customers. And there's not too many past the top 4 that actually can even afford to think about doing their own delivery. So yes, we're experiencing some loss to DIY in our top 2 accounts now. I think the time frame for when that happens is bounded, as Jim says, the impact it'll have on our business, and then you'll see our cumulative growth rates return to where the norm of the rest of the business is."

So if you can elaborate on that. And the second question is, obviously, we're seeing DIY happening at a couple of customers. What are the applications that are easy to kind of bring in-house?

On the enterprise business, I think, the success metrics would be around the products that we're -- the process of bringing to market. So for enterprise security, that would be our recursive DNS service, which will be designed to block malware, phishing attacks and blocking exfiltration of sensitive data from the enterprise. And we're launching that product later this year, and so you would look to see, and we'll be looking to see, the adoption rate of that capability. We'll also be bringing to market early next year our cloud-connected branch product, which is enterprise networking combined with a secure web gateway functionality. And that's designed to make the enterprise network scale in a much better performing way and in a much more cost-effective manner. And so we would be looking to see the adoption rates there. I think the potential in both of those areas is very large. But you're right, we're at the very early stages, and we have to see how successful we are with those products in the market next year. In terms of DIY and the top 2 accounts, I think you would look at things that are easier to deliver, for example, software, may be short-form VOD, videos on-demand, but short form. It's not OTT. And I think as you think about OTT, I don't see that as a DIY kind of thing today. It is much harder to do, particularly in the live and linear formats, particularly in a higher quality that you'll want to have when subscribers are actually paying to view the content. That's a whole different game. And there's a lot you have to do, and today, Akamai is in a great position to provide that quality. Just one example, being the first broadcast of 4K, but in general, sustaining very high bitrates, very lower rebuffer rates at scale, and that's what you need for OTT delivery.

Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. 
Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015. 
As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts of 2 of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it is meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these 2 customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year. 
I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, and so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so, was a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. 
In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale and security at a favorable price point. There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and costs.
Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs. Whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include: AT&T, Bell Canada, China telecom; Deutsch Telekom, Korea Telecom; Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T systems and Türk Telekom. 
Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well-known to have a DIY capabilities and all are Akamai customers. In aggregate, these 6 companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the 2 customers that we have talked about on past calls.
To be clear, I'm not talking about these 6 companies now because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary. We believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth from these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenue from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year.
While the near-term concern about DIY in our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these 6 companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017.
Of course, whenever there is a low in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while were always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure you that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. 
As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth. As more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber attacks continues to rise and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud. 
We believe that each of these trends provide significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate. Following the record-breaking results for the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again Akamai's ability to deliver live broadcast quality content reliably and securely at scale.
Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operations control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated NGS and client technologies, as well us our 4K and virtual reality solutions. 
Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our cloud security business. The revenue from our cloud security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment given that we started this business only 4 years ago. 
And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start with the many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years. 
Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable Web content. 
We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. 
In the area of Web performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance from mobile devices and especially for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device so that when the request is made, the response appears instantly.
We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on image manager has been very positive with 1 early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement.
In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead, so much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?"
24522,370125943,1012600,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concerned about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we wi",1970,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concerned about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago. This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall.
There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
And now on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15%, if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the mid-point of our guidance range, primarily due to less than expected media traffic from one of these customers.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. 
Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently large Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from 1 of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the 6 large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top or OTT customers. 
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our Web Performance and Cloud Security products.
Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company and the customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions for focus on the company's media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier products end customers. 
Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14% excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. 
Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. 
Lastly, revenue from our emerging enterprising carrier division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth on our Asia Pacific geography.
Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. 
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsibly balance investments in the business with the moderations and revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q1 levels consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million, up -- or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance.
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down 1 million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items.
Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software deployment activities. 
Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million.
During the quarter, we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. 
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward.
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year. Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the mid-point of this range, the year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017.
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million. As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we are experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future, most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed as fueling long-term growth and scale. Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. And as I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly the media business.
And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s for the near term. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect to Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62.
This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year. 
In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.

It certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017. But given the annuity nature of the business and the times revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for this is it wasn't that many, years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product, Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic and we'd expanded since then. That business call it 4.5 years later, is now about $360 million business. I think what Tom was referring to is these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of Bot Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPU as some of our security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong Jupiter to security growth kind of in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent -- Ion 3 obviously is an improvement of our existing product. But image manage is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our Web performance products."

It's just one of them that's a little bit lower, the traffic volume that customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform and it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have with their end users.

So yes, there will be a complainant of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have a marquee events, like the Euro cup, like the Olympics, like the presidential debate, and they do contribute some level of revenue, as we said in the past, these events by themselves are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's the opportunity is for more and more consumption of kind of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else. So yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity. Just in general, there's going to be more video delivery consume.

It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle in CDN services.

And the use Akamai to accelerate -- by the delivery of the video are excellent in the delivery of applications are secure the content.

24522,370125943,1012846,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the second quarter was",1451,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. 
Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015. 
As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts of 2 of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it is meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these 2 customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year. 
I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, and so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so is a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. 
For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale and security at a favorable price point. There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and costs.
Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs. Whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include: AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Systems and Türk Telekom. 
Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well-known to have DIY capabilities, and all are Akamai customers. In aggregate, these 6 companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the 2 customers that we have talked about on past calls.
To be clear, I'm not talking about these 6 companies now because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary, we believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth from these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenue from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year.
While the near-term concern about DIY in our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these 6 companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017.
Of course, whenever there is a low in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while were always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure you that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. 
As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth. As more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber attacks continues to rise and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud. 
We believe that each of these trends provide significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate. Following the record-breaking results for the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again, Akamai's ability to deliver live broadcast quality content reliably and securely at scale.
Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operations control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated ingest and client technologies as well as our 4K and virtual reality solutions. 
Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our cloud security business. The revenue from our cloud security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment, given that we started this business only 4 years ago. And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start, with the many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years. 
Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable web content. 
We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. 
In the area of web performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance from mobile devices and especially, for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device, so that when the request is made, the response appears instantly.
We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on Image Manager has been very positive, with 1 early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement.
In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. So much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?"
24522,370125943,1012846,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will",1971,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago. This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall.
There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
And now on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15%, if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to less-than-expected media traffic from one of these customers.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. 
Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently large Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from 1 of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the 6 large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year, with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top or OTT customers. 
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our web performance and cloud security products.
Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company and the customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions for focus on the company's Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier products end customers. 
Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Lastly, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth on our Asia Pacific geography.
Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. 
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsibly balance investments in the business with the moderations in revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q1 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million, up -- or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high end of our guidance range. 
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance.
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down 1 million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance. 
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% is also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software deployment activities. 
Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million.
During the quarter, we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. 
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what we have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward.
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year. 
Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the midpoint of this range, the year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017.
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million. 
As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we are experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future, most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. 
Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. And as I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly in the media business.  And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s for the near term. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62.
This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year. 
In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.

But I think it's probably worth noting that, that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our CapEx levels lower. Our CapEx levels are probably going to be below our long-term model. Last year, our CapEx levels were above our long-term model because we were doing some build-out for what we thought was going to be an OTT offering. So we kind of look at them together that you're going to have some years where you maybe a little bit above if you believe that you're going to be building out your network to support expected traffic growth.

It certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017. But given the annuity nature of the business and the times of revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for this is it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product, Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic, and we'd expanded since then. That business, call it 4.5 years later, is now about $360 million business. I think what Tom was referring to is, these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of Bot Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPUs as some of our security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong contributor to security growth kind of in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent -- Ion 3, obviously, is an improvement to our existing product. But Image Manager is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our web performance products."

And we didn't want to call acceleration in Q4 knowing that it's uncertain what holiday seasonality is going to be. I think our confidence that we will see reacceleration in Q1 is very high. But I'd say in Q4, it depends upon the holiday season. And if we have a very, very strong holiday season, both from the media side and on the web side, yes, you may see reacceleration in Q4. But I see our confidence is very high for entering 2017 and if there's a possibility in the fourth quarter, depending upon how the holiday shakes out."

It is probably important to note, we've been -- and we're trying to provide additional information for the sake of helpfulness that of the top 2 customers, one of the top 2 is pretty much in line with where we thought. It's just one of them that's a little bit lower, the traffic volume that customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform, and it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have with their end users. And so traffic came in a little bit later than we expected. And we're calling that now for Q3.

Our expectation going forward is that if we do see declines, the declines will be much more modest than what they've been. So yes, there will be a component of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have marquee events, like the Euro cup, like the Olympics, like the presidential debate, and they do contribute some level of revenue, as we said in the past, these events, by themselves, are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's the opportunity is for more and more consumption of kind of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else. So yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity. Just in general, there's going to be more video delivery consumed.

The extreme example being a background software download. The other end of the spectrum you might have live or linear broadcast where somebody is paying to watch it. And so, as you get to the easier end of the spectrum, that's where, I would say, most of the traffic has moved in-house, software downloads and so forth, or some videos with a quality might matter less. On the other side of the house, as we talked about, our OTT business is growing very well, much faster than the media business as a whole.

That said, we see much more competition from dozens of other companies than, generally, we would have from the large cloud providers. Our performance is a lot better. We don't really see the competition at all from them with the security, product capabilities. It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle-in CDN services. We have a lot of our customers use that company for hosting their website, either stored there or with compute, and they use Akamai to accelerate -- provide the delivery of the video or accelerate the delivery of applications or to secure the content. So I don't see any change in terms of the competition from these large Internet infrastructure companies against Akamai. So no change there. Now for their own content, as we've talked about at great length, there's a couple of them that are delivering more of their own content.

And now the vast majority of those carriers partner with Akamai and make use of our technology. And that's been the one fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And when I say competitive, I mean now an entity that's competing with us for third-party content. So the major shift in the competitive landscape has been favorable. We've always had a lot of startups. For a long time, we've had companies that have competed against us, and they would be the majority of the competition.

You have, on the other side, companies that have past experience in security as a box that is purchased and deployed in the enterprise's data center. That world is going away. The security technology needs to move into the cloud, and it's very hard to take technology that was dedicated to a single customer and operated by that customer in their data center, and now make it in the cloud to try to make it work in a multi-tenant environment, give it sufficient capacity and make it perform well. And on top of all that, make it be affordable. So we have tremendous home-field advantage in the cloud compared to the companies that are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud.

24522,370125943,1012994,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the second quarter wa",1450,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. 
Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015. 
As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts of 2 of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it is meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these 2 customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year. 
I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, and so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so is a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. 
For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale and security at a favorable price point. There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and cost.
Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs. Whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include: AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Systems and Türk Telekom. 
Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well-known to have DIY capabilities, and all are Akamai customers. In aggregate, these 6 companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the 2 customers that we have talked about on past calls.
To be clear, I'm not talking about these 6 companies now because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary, we believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth from these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenue from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year.
While the near-term concern about DIY in our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these 6 companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017.
Of course, whenever there is a lull in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while we're always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure you that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. 
As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth. As more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber attacks continues to rise and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud. 
We believe that each of these trends provide significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate. Following the record-breaking results for the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again, Akamai's ability to deliver live broadcast quality content reliably and securely at scale.
Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operations control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated ingest and client technologies as well as our 4K and virtual reality solutions. 
Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our cloud security business. The revenue from our cloud security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment, given that we started this business only 4 years ago. And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start, with many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years. 
Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable web content. 
We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. 
In the area of web performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance from mobile devices and especially for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device, so that when the request is made, the response appears instantly.
We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on Image Manager has been very positive, with one early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement.
In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. So much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?"
24522,370125943,1012994,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will",1970,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago. This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall.
There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
And now on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15%, if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to less-than-expected media traffic from one of these customers.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. 
Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently large Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from 1 of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the 6 large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year, with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top or OTT customers. 
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our web performance and cloud security products.
Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company and the customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions for focus on the company's Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier products end customers. 
Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Lastly, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth on our Asia Pacific geography.
Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. 
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsibly balance investments in the business with the moderations in revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down a point from Q1 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million, up -- or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high end of our guidance range. 
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance.
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down a million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance. 
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% is also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. 
Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million.
During the quarter, we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. 
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what we have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward.
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year. 
Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the midpoint of this range, the year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017.
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million. 
As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we are experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future, most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. 
Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. As I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly in the media business.  And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s for the near term. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62.
This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year. 
In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.

But I think it's probably worth noting that, that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our CapEx levels lower. Our CapEx levels are probably going to be below our long-term model. Last year, our CapEx levels were above our long-term model because we were doing some build-out for what we thought was going to be an OTT offering. So we kind of look at them together that you're going to have some years where you're maybe a little bit above if you believe that you're going to be building out your network to support expected traffic growth. We happen to be in a period here where we're growing into the traffic we have and selectively deploying in areas that we don't have capacity."

They certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017. But given the annuity nature of the business and the time to revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for these is it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product, Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic, and we'd expanded since then. That business, call it 4.5 years later, is now about $360 million business. I think what Tom's referring to is, these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of Bot Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPUs as some of our other security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong contributor to security growth kind of in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent -- Ion 3, obviously, is an improvement to our existing product. But Image Manager is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our web performance products."

But I'd say in Q4, it depends upon the holiday season. And if we have a very, very strong holiday season, both from the media side and on the web side, yes, you may see reacceleration in Q4. But I see our confidence is very high for entering 2017 and if there's a possibility in the fourth quarter, depending upon how the holiday shakes out."

It is probably important to note, we've been -- and we're trying to provide additional information for the sake of helpfulness that of the top 2 customers, one of the top 2 is pretty much in line with where we thought. It's just one of them that's a little bit lower, the traffic volume that customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform, and it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have of their end users. And so traffic came in a little bit later than we expected. And we're calling that now for Q3. And while we're not providing guidance beyond Q3 that I'd say that particular customer is the customer that we're going to stay pretty close to as far as where we think traffic volumes are going to go longer term."

Our expectation going forward is that if we do see declines, the declines will be much more modest than what they've been. So yes, there will be a component of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have marquee events, like the Euro cup, like the Olympics, like the presidential debate, and they do contribute some level of revenue, as we said in the past, these events by themselves are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's the opportunity is for more and more consumption of kind of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else. So yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity. Just in general, there's going to be more video delivery consumed. There will continue to be more consumption of social media. There will continue to be more gaming releases. There will continue to be more software downloads.

The extreme example being a background software download. At the other end of the spectrum you might have live or linear broadcast where somebody is paying to watch it. And so, as you get to the easier end of the spectrum, that's where I would say most of the traffic has moved in-house, software downloads and so forth, or some videos with a quality might matter less on the other side of the house. And as we talked about, our OTT business is growing very well, much faster than the media business as a whole.

That said, we see much more competition from dozens of other companies than generally we would have from the large cloud providers. Our performance is a lot better. We don't really see the competition at all from them with the security, product capabilities. It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle-in CDN services. We have a lot of our customers use that company for hosting their website, either stored there or with compute, and they use Akamai to accelerate -- to provide the delivery of the video or accelerate the delivery of applications or to secure the content. So I don't see any change in terms of the competition from these large Internet infrastructure companies against Akamai. So no change there. Now for their own content, as we've talked about at great length, there's a couple of them that are delivering more of their own content.

And the one big change we've seen in the competitive marketplace has really worked in our favor, and that is the major carriers. As I mentioned, many -- several years ago, most of those major carriers competed actively against Akamai. And now the vast majority of those carriers partner with Akamai and make use of our technology. And that's been the one fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And when I say competitive, I mean now an entity that's competing with us for third-party content. So the major shift in the competitive landscape has been favorable. We've always had a lot of startups. For a long time, we've had companies that have competed against us, and they would be the majority of the competition.

The security technology needs to move into the cloud, and it's very hard to take technology that was dedicated to a single customer and operated by that customer in their data center, and now make it in the cloud to try to make it work in a multi-tenant environment, give it sufficient capacity and make it perform well. And on top of all that, make it be affordable. So we have tremendous home-field advantage in the cloud compared to the companies that are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud.

24522,370125943,1014018,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the second quarter wa",1450,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. 
Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015. 
As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts of 2 of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it is meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these 2 customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year. 
I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, and so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so is a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. 
For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale and security at a favorable price point. There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and cost.
Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs. Whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include: AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Systems and Türk Telekom. 
Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well-known to have DIY capabilities, and all are Akamai customers. In aggregate, these 6 companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the 2 customers that we have talked about on past calls.
To be clear, I'm not talking about these 6 companies now because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary, we believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth from these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenue from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year.
While the near-term concern about DIY in our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these 6 companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017.
Of course, whenever there is a lull in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while we're always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure you that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. 
As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth. As more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber attacks continues to rise and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud. 
We believe that each of these trends provide significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate. Following the record-breaking results for the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again, Akamai's ability to deliver live broadcast quality content reliably and securely at scale.
Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operations control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated ingest and client technologies as well as our 4K and virtual reality solutions. 
Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our cloud security business. The revenue from our cloud security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment, given that we started this business only 4 years ago. And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start, with many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years. 
Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable web content. 
We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. 
In the area of web performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance from mobile devices and especially for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device, so that when the request is made, the response appears instantly.
We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on Image Manager has been very positive, with one early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement.
In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. So much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?"
24522,370125943,1014018,"Akamai Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will",1970,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among 2 of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago. This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall.
There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
And now on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15%, if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to less-than-expected media traffic from one of these customers.
Turning to our solution categories. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our cloud security offerings. 
Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently large Bot Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.
Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from 1 of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the 6 large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year, with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top or OTT customers. 
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our web performance and cloud security products.
Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company and the customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into 3 divisions for focus on the company's Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier products end customers. 
Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Lastly, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth on our Asia Pacific geography.
Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. 
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsibly balance investments in the business with the moderations in revenue growth rates.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down a point from Q1 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. 
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million, up -- or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high end of our guidance range. 
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance.
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down a million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance. 
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% is also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. 
Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million.
During the quarter, we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. 
Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multiyear capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what we have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward.
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year. 
Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the midpoint of this range, the year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017.
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million. 
As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposely slowed down the rate and pace of headcount additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we are experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future, most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. 
Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. As I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly in the media business.  And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s for the near term. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62.
This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. 
On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year. 
In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.

So it's a very, very large and growing business. It just so happens that as we're going through a -- for a couple of these 6 customers, as they serve more of the traffic themselves, we're seeing a moderation in media growth rates.

But I think it's probably worth noting that, that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our CapEx levels lower. Our CapEx levels are probably going to be below our long-term model. Last year, our CapEx levels were above our long-term model because we were doing some build-out for what we thought was going to be an OTT offering. So we kind of look at them together that you're going to have some years where you're maybe a little bit above if you believe that you're going to be building out your network to support expected traffic growth. We happen to be in a period here where we're growing into the traffic we have and selectively deploying in areas that we don't have capacity."

But we tend to do build-outs probably, call it, 3 months to 4 months in advance.

They certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017. But given the annuity nature of the business and the time to revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for these is it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product, Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic, and we'd expanded since then. That business, call it 4.5 years later, is now about $360 million business. I think what Tom's referring to is, these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of Bot Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPUs as some of our other security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong contributor to security growth kind of in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent -- Ion 3, obviously, is an improvement to our existing product. But Image Manager is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our web performance products."

It is probably important to note, we've been -- and we're trying to provide additional information for the sake of helpfulness that of the top 2 customers, one of the top 2 is pretty much in line with where we thought. It's just one of them that's a little bit lower, the traffic volume that customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform, and it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have of their end users. And so traffic came in a little bit later than we expected. And we're calling that now for Q3. And while we're not providing guidance beyond Q3 that I'd say that particular customer is the customer that we're going to stay pretty close to as far as where we think traffic volumes are going to go longer term."

Our expectation going forward is that if we do see declines, the declines will be much more modest than what they've been. So yes, there will be a component of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have marquee events, like the Euro cup, like the Olympics, like the presidential debate, and they do contribute some level of revenue, as we said in the past, these events by themselves are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's the opportunity is for more and more consumption of kind of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else. So yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity. Just in general, there's going to be more video delivery consumed. There will continue to be more consumption of social media. There will continue to be more gaming releases. There will continue to be more software downloads.

The question is how much of the traffic do they continue to serve themselves and how much of the traffic do we serve. It also depends upon, for some of these customers, new capabilities that they introduce. There may be new capabilities that they introduced that their CDN cannot support. And so it's very possible that you see a reacceleration in this customer base. Not all these customers are trending kind of downward. It's notable with 2 of them, but even 1 of these 2, depending upon launching new offerings, could be a reacceleration in growth for that customer as well. So it's tough to call.

And I guess where I'm going here is if it is a deceleration, which would be my guess, the concern is obviously that's going to go further down. And it goes back to all these questions around visibility. I appreciate that for 2017, you think growth is going to accelerate, but it sounds like it's based more on easy comps and the fact that these 2 top customers are getting to a point where they just can't go that much lower, at least that 1 in particular.

The extreme example being a background software download. At the other end of the spectrum you might have live or linear broadcast where somebody is paying to watch it. And so, as you get to the easier end of the spectrum, that's where I would say most of the traffic has moved in-house, software downloads and so forth, or some videos with a quality might matter less on the other side of the house. And as we talked about, our OTT business is growing very well, much faster than the media business as a whole. And that's because you have -- it's more difficult to do with a high-quality level, especially live and linear. And people are often paying to watch it, and so you really want to have a good experience there."

It does seem like the 6 -- the big 6 now are billing out a lot more of their own cloud capabilities and some seem to be bundling a little bit more CDN. So Tom, it just seems to be different competition from what we've had in the past. I know Google is -- their CDN's kind of in beta. Akamai's had their CDN out there for a while. I guess, you're obviously not concerned about competition from them and a lot of investors are. Can you maybe tell us a little bit more detail why you're not concerned?

That said, we see much more competition from dozens of other companies than generally we would have from the large cloud providers. Our performance is a lot better. We don't really see the competition at all from them with the security, product capabilities. It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle-in CDN services. We have a lot of our customers use that company for hosting their website, either stored there or with compute, and they use Akamai to accelerate -- to provide the delivery of the video or accelerate the delivery of applications or to secure the content. So I don't see any change in terms of the competition from these large Internet infrastructure companies against Akamai. So no change there. Now for their own content, as we've talked about at great length, there's a couple of them that are delivering more of their own content. And so -- and that, of course, has had the impact on our overall revenue growth rates this year.

And the one big change we've seen in the competitive marketplace has really worked in our favor, and that is the major carriers. As I mentioned, many -- several years ago, most of those major carriers competed actively against Akamai. And now the vast majority of those carriers partner with Akamai and make use of our technology. And that's been the one fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And when I say competitive, I mean now an entity that's competing with us for third-party content. So the major shift in the competitive landscape has been favorable. We've always had a lot of startups. For a long time, we've had companies that have competed against us, and they would be the majority of the competition. The cloud companies have been out there, for most of them, for a long, long time, and no shift there.

The security technology needs to move into the cloud, and it's very hard to take technology that was dedicated to a single customer and operated by that customer in their data center, and now make it in the cloud to try to make it work in a multi-tenant environment, give it sufficient capacity and make it perform well. And on top of all that, make it be affordable. So we have tremendous home-field advantage in the cloud compared to the companies that are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud.

Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarte",1471,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarter was $584 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 was $0.68 per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $172 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $444 million, up 146% over the same period from last year.
As we discussed during our last call, our overall revenue growth rates have been lower this year because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q3 revenue was $526 million, which is up 15% over Q3 of last year. It's important to note that our future exposure to DIY in these accounts is now more limited than in prior quarters since these 6 companies collectively accounted for 10% of our total revenue in the third quarter, down from 17% in Q3 of last year.
As I stated in past calls, while any company could, in theory, build their own CDN, I believe that such an approach is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers, especially when you consider the scale that is now needed to defend the website against cyber attacks. As a result, while I expect that there will be some further loss of revenue due to DIY efforts going forward, I believe that the continued strong growth of our core business means that we are very well positioned to reaccelerate our overall revenue growth rate in 2017.
I was especially pleased to see the accelerated growth rate for our web performance and Cloud Security Solutions in Q3. Our security products generated $95 million of revenue in Q3, up 46% year-over-year. Overall, the revenue from our Performance and Security products was up 19% year-over-year.
Performance and Security were also top of mind for the over 2,200 attendees from 42 countries at our Ninth Annual Customer Conference in San Francisco last week. At the conference, we shared Akamai's vision for the future of the Internet, and we demonstrated our next generation of services, which are focused on providing the utmost in quality, scale, agility and security for online applications. In addition, nearly 100 customers led discussions on topics such as the future of streaming television, personalized mobile experiences, the digital transformation of the enterprise, the proliferation of connected devices and the evolving cybersecurity landscape. Many speakers commented on the unique value that Akamai is providing for their online businesses. One, in particular, described how improving the performance of their web applications have led to $1 billion of increased revenue, with 80% of this amount being attributed to their use of Akamai services. For those of you who are interested, videos of this presentation as well as several others, including my keynote address on the future of the Internet, are available on our website at www.akamai.com.
I'm pleased to report that the innovation engine at Akamai has been running at full speed, and at the conference, we showcased some of our most exciting new solutions, including Image Manager, enterprise threat protector and enterprise application access as well as the next generation of our very successful Ion, Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager solutions. We also demonstrated several new SDKs that are designed to enable our customers to easily embed Akamai software into their applications. By embedding our software into their apps, our customers can achieve faster performance, better video quality, stronger security and, in many cases, lower costs. We can also preposition content on the devices, which enables our customers to deliver a high-quality experience even when a device doesn't have good connectivity to the Internet.
As you might imagine, the most pressing topic of concern at the conference was security. As the denial of service attacks last Friday demonstrate, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks are rapidly increasing, along with a potential for disruption and damage. To make matters worse, attackers are now exploiting the Internet of Things to greatly increase the scale of their attacks. This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and world-class security platform continue to make a critical difference. We have an excellent track record of successfully defending our customers against the Web's largest and most nefarious attacks. That's because we've made substantial investments in innovative defense technology and because we place our servers at the edge of the Internet where there is vastly more capacity than in centralized cloud data centers.
As bad as last week's attack were, I believe that much worse is yet to come. Hundreds of millions of devices are connecting to the Internet every year, and most are just as vulnerable as the DVRs and security cameras that were used in the Marais bot net attacks last week. Already this year, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers has more than doubled over 2015. And the number of reflection attacks is up by more than a factor of 3. Soon, we'll likely be measuring the size of such attacks in terabits per second. 
To address these concerns, we're continuing to develop new and innovative security offerings. In Q1, we planned to expand our offerings with the launches of Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Bot Manager 2.0. The next version of Kona Site Defender will add protection for API endpoints to help secure not only websites but also mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Our next-gen Bot Manager will feature enhanced bot detection and mitigation capabilities and stronger policy enforcement based on business needs. 
In addition to protecting websites and applications, we've also been developing services to help protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks. Phishing is now the leading delivery vehicle for malware and RAM somewhere, and malware is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, often bypassing existing blacklist-based security solutions and exploiting less protected threat vectors such as DNS.
In response to these growing enterprise security risks, we plan to launch our new enterprise threat protector, or ETP, service early next year. ETP provides a cloud-based recursive DNS service for enterprises that blocks access to malware sites and data exfiltration bot nets. 
At the conference, we also demonstrated our new enterprise application access service for securing enterprise apps. This service leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of SOHO Systems [ph], and it addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and effectively manage application access to a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. For example, many companies want to manage access differently for their employees, contractors, partners and other third parties. This is difficult to do using traditional solutions such as VPNs. Our new offering also removes the security risk inherent in traditional solutions by poking holes in firewalls to prevent access. And it provides access on a per-app basis, which further enhances security over traditional VPN solutions. The apps themselves can reside anywhere. For example, they can be hosted in a data center behind your traditional firewall or in a public cloud environment. App access is simple to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes, and best of all, they can then easily leverage Akamai's other Performance and Security Solutions for all their internal applications.
Q3 was also an active quarter for our media team. Our OTT business continued to grow at a strong rate, and we achieved several records for the broadcast of live events online. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016 [ph], we delivered a highly successful Rio Olympics and provided 43 broadcasters around the world with more than 10,000 hours of support. Akamai monitored the entire event from our award-winning broadcast operations control center, and we delivered an unprecedented online viewing experience for over 100 million unique users. Our platform streamed over 3 billion minutes of Olympic content, most of which was live, and we set a new record of 255 petabytes in total traffic delivered over the 19 days of the games. Later in the quarter, we also deliver a keynote event for a customer that exceeded the 11 terabits per second of live traffic, which is a record for a single event.
I believe that our experience and expertise in streaming high-quality, global events at scale reinforces our unique position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
In summary, I'm confident that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q3 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q4. Jim?"

As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 5% adjusted for",1991,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 5% adjusted for foreign exchange movements and up 15% if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers Tom just mentioned.
Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $345 million, growing 19% year-over-year and was the driver of our revenue overachievement in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions now make up nearly 60% of our total revenue. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our more highly differentiated, higher-margin offerings.
Within this solution category, we saw an acceleration of year-over-year growth for both our cloud security and Web Performance Solutions. Our protect-and-perform go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with both our existing and new customer base globally. 
Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $95 million, up 46% year-over-year. Exiting Q3, our security business is rapidly approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $400 million. We are extremely pleased with the continued strong customer adoption of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities and our recently launched Bot Manager offering. And as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to invest in product innovation and broaden our capabilities in the security space to drive additional growth. 
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $188 million in the quarter, down 14% year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past year, the impact of DIY efforts in a few of our large Internet platform customers continue to weigh heavily on growth rates in the solution category. Excluding the 6 large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenue was up 5% year-over-year. This growth rate was lower than what we've seen in the past several quarters, partially due to a difficult comparison to the strong Q3 of 2015 when we had several large favorable onetime items in our Asia Pacific region and partially from more and more customers upgrading their services from basic Media Delivery products to higher performing Web performance products. And while this product migration lowers our Media Delivery growth rates, we view it as a net positive for Akamai since our Web performance products tend to be stickier with our customers.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $51 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end, enterprise-class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our customer division results. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $285 million, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year but up a healthy 12%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. 
Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with last quarter and up 4 points from Q3 last year. International revenue was $180 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year or up 17% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a year-over-year basis and no impact on revenue on a sequential basis. Third quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $404 million, up 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the U.S. and weighed heavily on the U.S. markets results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of business.
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and down a point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and down 2 points from the same period last year.
GAAP operating expenses were $268 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $207 million, up about $5 million from Q2 levels and coming in near the low end of our guidance. We received the first payment from Limelight in Q3 as part of the resolution of our long-running patent litigation. This expense offset was not factored into our guidance and was the main driver of why non-GAAP cash OpEx came in a little lower than we expected. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $238 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and up $60 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from both Q2 levels and the same period last year and above the high end of our guidance, driven by our revenue overachievement and the Limelight payment that I just mentioned.
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, down slightly from Q2 levels and below the low end of our guidance due to the timing of network deployments. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $164 million, up $7 million from both Q2 levels and the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, up 1 point from Q2 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and 1 point above the high end of our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the third quarter was roughly $4 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $76 million or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share, down 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 32%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. This tax rate is about a point lower than our guidance due to higher mix of foreign earnings. 
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was approximately 176 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels, as a result of increased share buyback activity.
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter was 56 days, down 2 days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue and in line with our guidance for the quarter. 15% is slightly below our long-term model of 16% to 18% as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be extremely strong in Q3. Free cash flow was $172 million in the third quarter or 29% of revenue and $444 million year-to-date or 26% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $95 million on share repurchases, buying back 1.8 million shares. As of Q3 end, we had approximately $773 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. And given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q3, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-Commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict. In addition, we expect foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $3 million sequentially. Factoring in these variables, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $593 million to $613 million. To frame this guidance range, if the holiday -- online holiday season is particularly strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the online holiday season is not as strong, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue volumes, we expect Q4 cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%, both up 1 point from Q3 levels. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $222 million to $227 million, up roughly $20 million from Q3 levels. This sequential increase is larger than we've seen in recent years and is driven primarily by 2 factors: first, we will be absorbing both the [indiscernible] acquisitions; and second, as I shared with you on the previous calls, we are continuing to make important investments to drive incremental R&D innovation. Targeted spending in both areas is aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. Taking into account the items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margin of 39% to 40%. As I've said in the past, factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter-to-quarter. And as we absorb the [indiscernible] acquisitions, they will weigh on the EBITDA margins in the near term. While I'm not providing specific guidance beyond Q4, as I said in our last earnings call, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s in 2017. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q4 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $74 million to $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $82 million to $87 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, this level of CapEx could equate to 15% of revenue, slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue. 
In closing, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to reaccelerate revenue growth and execute on our long-term plans. 
Thank you, and Paul and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"

I think we perform very well and offer a very compelling service at a compelling price point, but I think some companies are just so large that they feel it's core that they have that capability themselves. Now of course, the impact will be less going forward because now it's 10% of our revenue instead a lot more. Now in terms of the acquisitions, I'll let Jim comment on the numbers there. But in terms of their capabilities, concrete systems helps us with managing Big Data. We think it's important for our IoT initiatives, which are in the early stages. SOHA Systems has a very compelling technology that we've been a customer of and really thought it was very important. It allows you to grant access to an enterprise application on a per-app, per-user basis without poking holes in your firewall, without reconfiguring your VPN, without shipping a laptop to an employee or contractor or partner halfway around the world. You set it up in minutes, you can grant access in minutes, and it's a heck of a lot more secure. It's also very synergistic with our services because now it enables us, once we're providing the access for the gap, we're actually delivering the app and we can accelerate it and provide security for the app, which is increasingly important as Enterprise Networks move into the cloud and the applications move into the cloud. Jim, do you want to comment on the revenue?"

As he mentioned that, that customer set represented about 10% of our revenues in Q3, down from 17% Q3 of last year.

So you're right that the -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the media product growth rates slowed from what was, call it, the low double digits in the first half to 5% ex the Internet Platform Customers in the third quarter. I mentioned a couple of drivers of it. One is the difficult compare in our Asia Pacific region, in particular, that had very robust media growth last Q3. And what we're seeing more and more is we're seeing more of our media customers that are -- were buying kind of a basic Media Delivery product. They're of operating, upgrading to a higher-performing Web Performance Solutions. So some of what you saw firm growth deceleration in media, you saw corresponding growth acceleration in the Web performance business as customers kind of shifted their products from a media product to a Web product. The only thing that's important to note is that, that's going to happen. One of the reasons why we went to the divisional structure for the company, this is more of a division of customer lens, is if you look at our media kind of division, it's growth rates were 12%. And so product migrations that go from kind of media to a Web product, when you're looking at it from a customer basis, it doesn't matter. And so the growth rates in when you look at it across the division lens that we had strong growth rates in Web customers. Web customers were 17% growth.

They're more notable events for what's capable for serving kind of live content across that many people. It's really a display of capability more than it is a display of incremental revenue. So it's not as notable as kind of people might think. And I'm not going to provide guidance for 2017 for each one of these segments, but you're right. You may see a bit when you look at a product segments, you may see a bit of a share shift from kind of media to Web. We'll have to see that, I'd say, I think what we've seen notably is some large customers that have migrated from media product to a Web product. I don't know how much more notable definitely going forward, but there's a possibility that you'll start to see a shift from media to Web performance products. But again, when you look at it in a division lens, which I think is a more important way to look at it, that it's strong growth across all of the customer sets.

Increasingly, media companies really care about security, so they want all of their content to run through Kona Site Defender, and the entry-level delivery product there would be DST, which is a Web product. So what you see them doing is moving from basic object delivery, basic caching into Performance and Security product, And that's good. That's a good thing. It is a higher-margin business. As Jim said, it's stickier. And then from there, once they're more deeply on the platform, we can to other capabilities, things like Image Manager, Bot Manager. So it's a good mix shift for us."

The buyer is a little bit different for our enterprise products. Now there is a commonality with the Chief Security Officer, commonality with the CIO, but the person who's worried about the enterprise network or the enterprise app security or the enterprise apps is often different than the person whose day-to-day job is enterprise websites. That said, we have great relationships in many major enterprises, and so it's easy for us to cross over. We do have folks that have special training around the new enterprise products. The beauty of both enterprise rep protector and enterprise application access is they are very easy to integrate and to turn on. And the value proposition is, I think, relatively easy to explain, much easier than things like Kona Site Defender and Ion, for that matter. So I'm very optimistic that it will be -- it will have success in being able to cross over with the enterprise products. And yes, we'll have a new suite of competitors as we move into the enterprise market. We'll be probably seeing the big box providers who are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud. And the big advantage we have is that we know how to work in the cloud very well with high performance and high security and then with a shared platform, and that's a big advantage."

Not to mention with very large-scale attacks, the human cost of monitoring it, making sure everything is fine and that there's no downstream impacts. So it's like running a very large-scale event at some level for however long the attack goes. So it can be expensive over time.

It could be announcement of things that are going to cause more consumption possibly of online activity. It could be the introduction of new offerings, potentially new offerings for over-the-top bundles, things of that nature.

The traditional landscape has been dominated by companies that sell you devices that you install in your data center. And that just doesn't work anymore. The scale of the attacks makes it really impossible to defend yourselves successfully that way. You just you can't afford enough, and you can't get enough connectivity with these larger attacks. And what you need really is Akamai because we have such large scale with our platform and where we place our servers at the edge of the Internet. Given the large cloud data centers cannot scale with these kinds of attacks. So we're uniquely well positioned to defend against the large attacks. I think every enterprise needs to worry about it. And I think there'll be increased awareness after Friday's attacks, that this is a big deal. So I think there's tremendous upside in the TAM across, really, all of our customer segments. And that's just for the DDoS attacks. Of course, we also saw the Kona Site Defender solution that adds application layer defenses. That's where the bad guys are trying to come in and corrupt your website and trying to steal your confidential information. And then beyond that, as we talked about, we'll be entering the enterprise security space. And that's where the bad guys are trying to infect the employees with malware, trying to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data such as e-mails. And that's potentially an even larger market down the road."

Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarte",1464,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarter was $584 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 was $0.68 per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $172 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $444 million, up 146% over the same period from last year.
As we discussed during our last call, our overall revenue growth rates have been lower this year because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q3 revenue was $526 million, which is up 15% over Q3 of last year. It's important to note that our future exposure to DIY in these accounts is now more limited than in prior quarters since these 6 companies collectively accounted for 10% of our total revenue in the third quarter, down from 17% in Q3 of last year.
As I've stated in past calls, while any company could, in theory, build their own CDN, I believe that such an approach is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers, especially when you consider the scale that is now needed to defend the website against cyber attacks. As a result, while I expect that there will be some further loss of revenue due to DIY efforts going forward, I believe that the continued strong growth of our core business means that we are very well positioned to reaccelerate our overall revenue growth rate in 2017.
I was especially pleased to see the accelerated growth rate for our web performance and Cloud Security Solutions in Q3. Our security products generated $95 million of revenue in Q3, up 46% year-over-year. Overall, the revenue from our Performance and Security products was up 19% year-over-year.
Performance and Security were also top of mind for the over 2,200 attendees from 42 countries at our Ninth Annual Customer Conference in San Francisco last week. At the conference, we shared Akamai's vision for the future of the Internet, and we demonstrated our next generation of services, which are focused on providing the utmost in quality, scale, agility and security for online applications. In addition, nearly 100 customers led discussions on topics such as the future of streaming television, personalized mobile experiences, the digital transformation of the enterprise, the proliferation of connected devices and the evolving cybersecurity landscape. Many speakers commented on the unique value that Akamai is providing for their online businesses. One, in particular, described how improving the performance of their web applications have led to $1 billion of increased revenue, with 80% of this amount being attributed to their use of Akamai services. For those of you who are interested, videos of this presentation as well as several others, including my keynote address on the future of the Internet, are available on our website at www.akamai.com.
I'm pleased to report that the innovation engine at Akamai has been running at full speed, and at the conference, we showcased some of our most exciting new solutions, including Image Manager, enterprise threat protector and enterprise application access as well as the next generation of our very successful Ion, Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager solutions. We also demonstrated several new SDKs that are designed to enable our customers to easily embed Akamai software into their applications. By embedding our software into their apps, our customers can achieve faster performance, better video quality, stronger security and, in many cases, lower costs. We can also preposition content on the devices, which enables our customers to deliver a high-quality experience even when a device doesn't have good connectivity to the Internet.
As you might imagine, the most pressing topic of concern at the conference was security. As the denial of service attacks last Friday demonstrate, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks are rapidly increasing, along with the potential for disruption and damage. To make matters worse, attackers are now exploiting the Internet of Things to greatly increase the scale of their attacks. This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and world-class security platform continue to make a critical difference. We have an excellent track record of successfully defending our customers against the web's largest and most nefarious attacks. That's because we've made substantial investments in innovative defense technology and because we place our servers at the edge of the Internet where there is vastly more capacity than in centralized cloud data centers.
As bad as last week's attacks were, I believe that much worse is yet to come. Hundreds of millions of devices are connecting to the Internet every year, and most are just as vulnerable as the DVRs and security cameras that were used in the Marais botnet attacks last week. Already this year, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers has more than doubled over 2015. And the number of reflection attacks is up by more than a factor of 3. Soon, we'll likely be measuring the size of such attacks in terabits per second. 
To address these concerns, we're continuing to develop new and innovative security offerings. In Q1, we plan to expand our offerings with the launches of Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Bot Manager 2.0. The next version of Kona Site Defender will add protection for API endpoints to help secure not only websites but also mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Our next-gen Bot Manager will feature enhanced bot detection and mitigation capabilities and stronger policy enforcement based on business needs. 
In addition to protecting websites and applications, we've also been developing services to help protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks. Phishing is now the leading delivery vehicle for malware and ransomware, and malware is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, often bypassing existing blacklist-based security solutions and exploiting less-protected threat vectors, such as DNS.
In response to these growing enterprise security risks, we plan to launch our new enterprise threat protector, or ETP, service early next year. ETP provides a cloud-based recursive DNS service for enterprises that blocks access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. 
At the conference, we also demonstrated our new enterprise application access service for securing enterprise apps. This service leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems, and it addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and effectively manage application access to a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. For example, many companies want to manage access differently for their employees, contractors, partners and other third parties. This is difficult to do using traditional solutions such as VPNs.
Our new offering also removes the security risk inherent in traditional solutions by poking holes in firewalls to prevent access. And it provides access on a per-app basis, which further enhances security over traditional VPN solutions. The apps themselves can reside anywhere. For example, they can be hosted in a data center behind your traditional firewall or in a public cloud environment. App access is simple to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes. And best of all, they can then easily leverage Akamai's other Performance and Security Solutions for all their internal applications.
Q3 was also an active quarter for our media team. Our OTT business continued to grow at a strong rate, and we achieved several records for the broadcast of live events online. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016, we delivered a highly successful Rio Olympics and provided 43 broadcasters around the world with more than 10,000 hours of support. Akamai monitored the entire event from our award-winning Broadcast Operations Control Center, and we delivered an unprecedented online viewing experience for over 100 million unique users. Our platform streamed over 3 billion minutes of Olympic content, most of which was live, and we set a new record of 255 petabytes in total traffic delivered over the 19 days of the games. Later in the quarter, we also delivered a keynote event for a customer that exceeded 11 terabits per second of live traffic, which is a record for a single event.
I believe that our experience and expertise in streaming high-quality, global events at scale reinforces our unique position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
In summary, I'm confident that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q3 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q4. Jim?"

As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 5% adjusted for foreign exchange movements and up 15% if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers Tom just mentioned.
Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $345 million, growing 19% year-over-year and was the driver of our revenue overachievement in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions now make up nearly 60% of our total revenue. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our more highly differentiated, higher-margin offerings.
Within this solution category, we saw an acceleration of year-over-year growth for both our cloud security and Web Performance Solutions. Our protect-and-perform go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with both our existing and new customer base globally. 
Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $95 million, up 46% year-over-year. Exiting Q3, our security business is rapidly approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $400 million. We are extremely pleased with the continued strong customer adoption of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities and our recently launched Bot Manager offering. And as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to invest in product innovation and broaden our capabilities in the security space to drive additional growth. 
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $188 million in the quarter, down 14% year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past year, the impact of DIY efforts in a few of our large Internet platform customers continue to weigh heavily on growth rates in this solution category. Excluding the 6 large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenue was up 5% year-over-year. This growth rate was slower than what we've seen in the past several quarters, partially due to a difficult comparison to the strong Q3 of 2015 when we had several large favorable onetime items in our Asia-Pacific region and partially from more and more customers upgrading their services from basic Media Delivery products to higher performing Web performance products. And while this product migration lowers our Media Delivery growth rates, we view it as a net positive for Akamai since our Web performance products tend to be stickier with our customers.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $51 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end, enterprise-class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our customer division results. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $285 million, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year but up a healthy 12%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. 
Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with last quarter and up 4 points from Q3 last year. International revenue was $180 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year or up 17% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a year-over-year basis and no impact on revenue on a sequential basis. Third quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $404 million, up 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the U.S. and weighed heavily on the U.S. markets results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and down a point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and down 2 points from the same period last year.
GAAP operating expenses were $268 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $207 million, up about $5 million from Q2 levels and coming in near the low end of our guidance.
We received the first payment from Limelight in Q3 as part of the resolution of our long-running patent litigation. This expense offset was not factored into our guidance and was the main driver of why non-GAAP cash OpEx came in a little lower than we expected. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $238 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and up $60 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from both Q2 levels and the same period last year and above the high end of our guidance, driven by our revenue overachievement and the Limelight payment that I just mentioned.
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, down slightly from Q2 levels and below the low end of our guidance due to the timing of network deployments. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $164 million, up $7 million from both Q2 levels and the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, up 1 point from Q2 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and 1 point above the high end of our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the third quarter was roughly $4 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $76 million or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share, down 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 32%. Taxes included in are non-GAAP earnings or $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. This tax rate is about a point lower than our guidance due to higher mix of foreign earnings. 
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was approximately 176 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels, as a result of increased share buyback activity.
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter was 56 days, down 2 days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue and in line with our guidance for the quarter. 15% is slightly below our long-term model of 16% to 18% as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be extremely strong in Q3. Free cash flow was $172 million in the third quarter or 29% of revenue and $444 million year-to-date or 26% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $95 million on share repurchases, buying back 1.8 million shares. As of Q3 end, we had approximately $773 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. And given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q3, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict.
In addition, we expect foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $3 million sequentially. Factoring in these variables, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $593 million to $613 million. To frame this guidance range, if the holiday -- online holiday season is particularly strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the online holiday season is not as strong, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue volumes, we expect Q4 cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%, both up 1 point from Q3 levels. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $222 million to $227 million, up roughly $20 million from Q3 levels. This sequential increase is larger than we've seen in recent years and is driven primarily by 2 factors: first, we will be absorbing both the Soha and Concorde acquisitions; and second, as I shared with you on the previous calls, we are continuing to make important investments to drive incremental R&D innovation. Targeted spending in both areas is aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale.
Taking into account the items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margin of 39% to 40%. As I've said in the past, factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter-to-quarter. And as we absorb the Soha and Concord acquisitions, they will weigh on the EBITDA margins in the near term. While I'm not providing specific guidance beyond Q4, as I said in our last earnings call, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s in 2017. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q4 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $74 million to $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $82 million to $87 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, this level of CapEx could equate to 15% of revenue, slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue. 
In closing, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to reaccelerate revenue growth and execute on our long-term plans. 
Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions."

On the big 6, I would expect some small further declines in the revenue there in the near term. It's hard to predict the longer term. As we've talked about, they are -- they do have their own do-it-yourself platforms. I think we perform very well and offer a very compelling service at a compelling price point, but I think some companies are just so large that they feel it's core that they have that capability themselves. Now of course, the impact will be less going forward because now it's 10% of our revenue instead of a lot command  more. Now in terms of the acquisitions, I'll let Jim comment on the numbers there. But in terms of their capabilities, concrete systems helps us with managing Big Data. We think it's important for our IoT initiatives, which are in the early stages. Soha Systems has a very compelling technology that we've been a customer of and really thought it was very important. It allows you to grant access to an enterprise application on a per-app, per-user basis without poking holes in your firewall, without reconfiguring your VPN, without shipping a laptop to an employee or contractor or partner halfway around the world. You set it up in minutes, you can grant access in minutes, and it's a heck of a lot more secure. It's also very synergistic with our services because now it enables us, once we're providing the access for the gap, we're actually delivering the app and we can accelerate it and provide security for the app, which is increasingly important as Enterprise Networks move into the cloud and the applications move into the cloud. Jim, do you want to comment on the revenue?"

And finally, to make the enterprise networking be more efficient, Enterprise Networks are about to go into their next generation, it'll look different in the future, and offloading from congested types into branch offices.

I mentioned",302,"Right. So you're right that the -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the media product growth rates slowed from what was, call it, the low double digits in the first half to 5% ex the Internet platform customers in the third quarter. I mentioned a couple of drivers of it. One is the difficult compare in our Asia-Pacific region, in particular, that had very robust media growth last Q3. And what we're seeing more and more is we're seeing more of our media customers that are -- were buying kind of a basic media delivery product. They're now upgrading. They're upgrading to a higher-performing web performance solution. So some of what you saw for growth deceleration in media, you saw corresponding growth acceleration in the Web Performance business as customers kind of shifted their products from a media product to a web product. The only thing that's important to note is that, that's going to happen. One of the reasons why we went to the divisional structure for the company, which is more of a division of customer lens, is if you look at our media kind of division, its growth rates were 12%. And so product migrations that go from kind of media to a web product. When you're looking at it from a customer basis, it doesn't matter. And so the growth rates -- and when you look at it across the division lens that we had strong growth rates in web customers. Web customers were 17% growth. We had strong growth rates in our media customers of 12%. It just so happened that our media products that we've seen a little bit of a shift of customers as they migrate from one product to another. And actually, when they do that, they're actually a bit stickier."

So certainly, on the Olympics that -- we said it all along that the Olympics doesn't necessarily drive huge revenue. It drives a little bit of revenue. There are more notable events for what's capable for serving kind of live content across that many people. So it's really a display of capability more than it is a display of incremental revenue. So it's not as notable as kind of people might think. And I'm not going to provide guidance for 2017 for each one of these segments. But you're right, you may see a bit -- when you look at the product segments, you may see a bit of a share shift from kind of media to web. We'll have to see that it -- I'd say, I think what we've seen, notably, is some large customers that have migrated from media products to a web product. I don't know how much more notable that's going to be going forward, but there's a possibility that you'll start to see a shift from media to Web Performance products. But again, when you look at it in a division lens, which, I think, is a more important way to look at it, that it's strong growth across all of the customer sets. And as we said to you that we tend to find that our Performance and Security Solutions are stickier, represents 60% of our revenue. So from an investor perspective that we're actually starting to see growth acceleration come from the part of our business that is stickier with customers."

And we believe that there's huge, huge growth opportunities for the company for the long term. And we're going to make those investments now.

Increasingly, media companies really care about security, so they want all of their content to run through Kona Site Defender, and the entry-level delivery product there would be DSD, which is a web product. So what you see them doing is moving from basic object delivery, basic caching into Performance and Security product and that's good. That's a good thing. It is a higher-margin business. As Jim said, it's stickier. And then from there, once they're more deeply on the platform, we can sell other capabilities, things like Image Manager, Bot Manager. So it's a good mix shift for us."

So the -- it's tough to say what the media growth is going to be ex the Internet platform guys. Yes, they grew 5% in the third quarter. As we've said in the past, that the media product category is really about traffic. And there's a lot of things that cause traffic to kind of ebb and flow: big software releases; gaming releases; more video delivery. So I don't know if I would say 5% is the new normal. I mean, obviously, 5% is what we did in the third quarter. I do think it's going to be pressured in that we have had some large customers that have transitioned from buying a media product to now -- to a web product. So in that case, it will be pressured. But I still think this is a significant opportunity for growth in our media products and -- which is one of the reasons, again, going back to the divisional lens that we introduced a couple of quarters ago, that's one of the reasons why group customers the way we have because, I think, seeing what those consumers are doing as a composite, I think, is a more important in meaningful way to look at it. And relative to the holiday season, I mean, you can look at some of the things that we do. You can look at announcements, announcements of -- it could be gaming releases. It could be announcement of things that are going to cause more consumption possibly of online activity. It could be the introduction of new offerings, potentially new offerings, for over-the-top bundles, things of that nature, looking at things like comp score around what their predictions are going to be for the online e-commerce season. So there's a bunch of things that you can look at to kind of get a gauge. You'll see statistics. You can't always directly correlate them to how we're going to fare, but they're probably reasonable proof points around whether things are trending in the right direction."

And it's hard to pick a percentage, as you know, because it's a function of what happens with the rest of our business as well. I can tell you that, roughly, where -- the revenue volumes, as Tom mentioned, we can expect, they're probably going to go down a little bit from where they were in Q3. I don't think you're going to see notably, I think, these customers as a grouping, that there's still going to be a sizable revenue contributor in 2017. Whether they're contributing at the levels that they are now or something less than that, it's hard to predict. But I think that they'll still be reasonable-sized customers as a grouping at least for 2017. And relative to -- I'm not exactly sure what your question is around Performance and Security that -- I think the point is that Performance and Security growth rates were 19% in Q3. We saw an acceleration in Web Performance. We saw an acceleration in Cloud Security. What I was suggesting is that outside of that, we had a modest benefit in our custom government projects, which probably contributed to about a point of that growth, so call it, the 19% growth. It would have been more like 18% growth had it not been for a couple of large projects."

Even the large cloud data centers cannot scale with these kinds of attacks. So we're uniquely well positioned to defend against the large attacks. I think every enterprise needs to worry about it.

And that's just for the DoS attacks. Of course, we also sell the Kona Site Defender solution that adds application-layer defenses. That's where the bad guys are trying to come in and corrupt your website and trying to steal your confidential information.

Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarte",1465,"Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarter was $584 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 was $0.68 per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $172 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $444 million, up 146% over the same period from last year.
As we discussed during our last call, our overall revenue growth rates have been lower this year because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q3 revenue was $526 million, which is up 15% over Q3 of last year. It's important to note that our future exposure to DIY in these accounts is now more limited than in prior quarters since these 6 companies collectively accounted for 10% of our total revenue in the third quarter, down from 17% in Q3 of last year.
As I've stated in past calls, while any company could, in theory, build their own CDN, I believe that such an approach is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers, especially when you consider the scale that is now needed to defend a website against cyber attacks. As a result, while I expect that there will be some further loss of revenue due to DIY efforts going forward, I believe that the continued strong growth of our core business means that we are very well positioned to reaccelerate our overall revenue growth rate in 2017.
I was especially pleased to see the accelerated growth rate for our web performance and Cloud Security Solutions in Q3. Our security products generated $95 million of revenue in Q3, up 46% year-over-year. Overall, the revenue from our Performance and Security products was up 19% year-over-year.
Performance and Security were also top of mind for the over 2,200 attendees from 42 countries at our Ninth Annual Customer Conference in San Francisco last week. At the conference, we shared Akamai's vision for the future of the Internet, and we demonstrated our next generation of services, which are focused on providing the utmost in quality, scale, agility and security for online applications. In addition, nearly 100 customers led discussions on topics such as the future of streaming television, personalized mobile experiences, the digital transformation of the enterprise, the proliferation of connected devices and the evolving cyber security landscape. Many speakers commented on the unique value that Akamai is providing for their online businesses. One, in particular, described how improving the performance of their web applications had led to $1 billion of increased revenue, with 80% of this amount being attributed to their use of Akamai services. For those of you who are interested, videos of this presentation as well as several others, including my keynote address on the future of the Internet, are available on our website at www.akamai.com.
I'm pleased to report that the innovation engine at Akamai has been running at full speed, and at the conference, we showcased some of our most exciting new solutions, including Image Manager, enterprise threat protector and enterprise application access as well as the next generation of our very successful Ion, Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager solutions. We also demonstrated several new SDKs that are designed to enable our customers to easily embed Akamai software into their applications. By embedding our software into their apps, our customers can achieve faster performance, better video quality, stronger security and, in many cases, lower costs. We can also preposition content on the devices, which enables our customers to deliver a high-quality experience even when a device doesn't have good connectivity to the Internet.
As you might imagine, the most pressing topic of concern at the conference was security. As the denial of service attacks last Friday demonstrate, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks are rapidly increasing, along with the potential for disruption and damage. To make matters worse, attackers are now exploiting the Internet of Things to greatly increase the scale of their attacks. This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and world-class security platform continue to make a critical difference. We have an excellent track record of successfully defending our customers against the web's largest and most nefarious attacks. That's because we've made substantial investments in innovative defense technology and because we place our servers at the edge of the Internet where there is vastly more capacity than in centralized cloud data centers.
As bad as last week's attacks were, I believe that much worse is yet to come. Hundreds of millions of devices are connecting to the Internet every year, and most are just as vulnerable as the DVRs and security cameras that were used in the Marais botnet attacks last week. Already this year, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers has more than doubled over 2015. And the number of reflection attacks is up by more than a factor of 3. Soon, we'll likely be measuring the size of such attacks in terabits per second. 
To address these concerns, we're continuing to develop new and innovative security offerings. In Q1, we plan to expand our offerings with the launches of Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Bot Manager 2.0. The next version of Kona Site Defender will add protection for API endpoints to help secure not only websites but also mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Our next-gen Bot Manager will feature enhanced bot detection and mitigation capabilities and stronger policy enforcement based on business needs. 
In addition to protecting websites and applications, we've also been developing services to help protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks. Phishing is now the leading delivery vehicle for malware and ransomware, and malware is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, often bypassing existing blacklist-based security solutions and exploiting less-protected threat vectors, such as DNS.
In response to these growing enterprise security risks, we plan to launch our new Enterprise Threat Protector, or ETP, service early next year. ETP provides a cloud-based recursive DNS service for enterprises that blocks access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. 
At the conference, we also demonstrated our new enterprise application access service for securing enterprise apps. This service leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems, and it addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and effectively manage application access to a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. For example, many companies want to manage access differently for their employees, contractors, partners and other third parties. This is difficult to do using traditional solutions such as VPNs.
Our new offering also removes the security risk inherent in traditional solutions by poking holes in firewalls to prevent access. And it provides access on a per-app basis, which further enhances security over traditional VPN solutions. The apps themselves can reside anywhere. For example, they can be hosted in a data center behind your traditional firewall or in a public cloud environment. App access is simple to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes. And best of all, they can then easily leverage Akamai's other Performance and Security Solutions for all their internal applications.
Q3 was also an active quarter for our media team. Our OTT business continued to grow at a strong rate, and we achieved several records for the broadcast of live events online. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016, we delivered a highly successful Rio Olympics and provided 43 broadcasters around the world with more than 10,000 hours of support. Akamai monitored the entire event from our award-winning Broadcast Operations Control Center, and we delivered an unprecedented online viewing experience for over 100 million unique users. Our platform streamed over 3 billion minutes of Olympic content, most of which was live, and we set a new record of 255 petabytes in total traffic delivered over the 19 days of the games. Later in the quarter, we also delivered a keynote event for a customer that exceeded 11 terabits per second of live traffic, which is a record for a single event.
I believe that our experience and expertise in streaming high-quality, global events at scale reinforces our unique position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.
In summary, I'm confident that Akamai's business and market position remains strong, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q3 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q4. Jim?"

As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 5% adjusted for",1995,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 5% adjusted for foreign exchange movements and up 15% if you exclude the 6 large Internet platform customers Tom just mentioned.
Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $345 million, growing 19% year-over-year and was the driver of our revenue overachievement in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions now make up nearly 60% of our total revenue. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our more highly differentiated, higher-margin offerings.
Within this solution category, we saw an acceleration of year-over-year growth for both our cloud security and Web Performance Solutions. Our protect-and-perform go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with both our existing and new customer base globally. 
Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $95 million, up 46% year-over-year. Exiting Q3, our security business is rapidly approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $400 million. We are extremely pleased with the continued strong customer adoption of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities and our recently launched Bot Manager offering. And as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to invest in product innovation and broaden our capabilities in the security space to drive additional growth. 
Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions. Revenue was $188 million in the quarter, down 14% year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past year, the impact of DIY efforts in a few of our large Internet platform customers continue to weigh heavily on growth rates in this solution category. Excluding the 6 large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenue was up 5% year-over-year. This growth rate was slower than what we've seen in the past several quarters, partially due to a difficult comparison to the strong Q3 of 2015 when we had several large favorable onetime items in our Asia-Pacific region and partially from more and more customers upgrading their services from basic Media Delivery products to higher performing Web performance products. And while this product migration lowers our Media Delivery growth rates, we view it as a net positive for Akamai since our Web performance products tend to be stickier with our customers.
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $51 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end, enterprise-class professional services globally. 
Turning now to our customer division results. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $285 million, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year but up a healthy 12%, excluding the impact of the 6 large Internet platform customers. 
Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with last quarter and up 4 points from Q3 last year. International revenue was $180 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year or up 17% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a year-over-year basis and no impact on revenue on a sequential basis. Third quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $404 million, up 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the U.S. and weighed heavily on the U.S. markets results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.
Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and down a point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and down 2 points from the same period last year.
GAAP operating expenses were $268 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $207 million, up about $5 million from Q2 levels and coming in near the low end of our guidance.
We received the first payment from Limelight in Q3 as part of the recent resolution of our long-running patent litigation. This expense offset was not factored into our guidance and was the main driver of why non-GAAP cash OpEx came in a little lower than we expected. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $238 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and up $16 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from both Q2 levels and the same period last year and above the high end of our guidance, driven by our revenue overachievement and the Limelight payment that I just mentioned.
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, down slightly from Q2 levels and below the low end of our guidance due to the timing of network deployments. 
Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $164 million, up $7 million from both Q2 levels and the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, up 1 point from Q2 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and 1 point above the high end of our guidance.
Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the third quarter was roughly $4 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $76 million or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share, down 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 32%. Taxes included in are non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. This tax rate is about a point lower than our guidance due to higher mix of foreign earnings. 
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was approximately 176 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels, as a result of increased share buyback activity.
Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter was 56 days, down 2 days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue and in line with our guidance for the quarter. 15% is slightly below our long-term model of 16% to 18% as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.
Cash flow generation continued to be extremely strong in Q3. Free cash flow was $172 million in the third quarter or 29% of revenue and $444 million year-to-date or 26% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $95 million on share repurchases, buying back 1.8 million shares. As of Q3 end, we had approximately $773 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. And given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q3, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict.
In addition, we expect foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $3 million sequentially. Factoring in these variables, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $593 million to $613 million. To frame this guidance range, if the holiday -- online holiday season is particularly strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the online holiday season is not as strong, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue volumes, we expect Q4 cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%, both up 1 point from Q3 levels. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $222 million to $227 million, up roughly $20 million from Q3 levels. This sequential increase is larger than we've seen in recent years and is driven primarily by 2 factors: first, we will be absorbing both the Soha and Concord acquisitions; and second, as I shared with you on the previous calls, we are continuing to make important investments to drive incremental R&D innovation. Targeted spending in both areas is aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale.
Taking into account the items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margin of 39% to 40%. As I've said in the past, factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter-to-quarter. And as we absorb the Soha and Concord acquisitions, they will weigh on the EBITDA margins in the near term. While I'm not providing specific guidance beyond Q4, as I said in our last earnings call, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30s in 2017. 
Moving on to depreciation. We expect Q4 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $74 million to $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $82 million to $87 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, this level of CapEx would equate to 15% of revenue, slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue. 
In closing, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to reaccelerate revenue growth and execute on our long-term plans. 
Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions."

As we've talked about, they are -- they do have their own do-it-yourself platforms. I think we perform very well and offer a very compelling service at a compelling price point, but I think some companies are just so large that they feel it's core that they have that capability themselves. Now of course, the impact will be less going forward because now it's 10% of our revenue instead of a lot more. Now in terms of the acquisitions, I'll let Jim comment on the numbers there. But in terms of their capabilities, concrete systems helps us with managing Big Data. We think it's important for our IoT initiatives, which are in the early stages. Soha Systems has a very compelling technology that we've been a customer of and really thought it was very important. It allows you to grant access to an enterprise application on a per-app, per-user basis without poking holes in your firewall, without reconfiguring your VPN, without shipping a laptop to an employee or contractor or partner halfway around the world. You set it up in minutes, you can grant access in minutes, and it's a heck of a lot more secure. It's also very synergistic with our services because now it enables us, once we're providing the access for the app, we're actually delivering the app and we can accelerate it and provide security for the app, which is increasingly important as Enterprise Networks move into the cloud and the applications move into the cloud. Jim, do you want to comment on the revenue?"

And that's roughly the size of what our enterprise business is today. So you can expect we're going to continue to invest organically and inorganically, as you've seen with the most recent acquisition with Soha in the enterprise space. And as Tom's talked about in the past that we believe the revenue potential in the enterprise business is equivalent, if not bigger, than that of our delivery business in media as well as our performance businesses. So I can -- we're very early stage. I think it's going to be a significant driver of growth for the company. I think it's going to take a while for that business to ramp. But I think we have a proof point of what we've done in security, and this is about basically taking, again, the Akamai platform and now applying it to the enterprise use case. So I think we're quite bullish on the growth opportunities in the long term for enterprise."

And I think it allows investors to draw their own conclusions around what they think could happen with that customer set. As he mentioned, that customer set represented about 10% of our revenues in Q3, down from 17% Q3 of last year. So you can certainly see that, that's about a 40% drop in revenues year-on-year. Notably, it's being driven by kind of the top 2 that we did mention. And more notably, one of those top 2 is the one that actually declined sequentially."

So you're right that the -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the media product growth rates slowed from what was, call it, the low double digits in the first half to 5% ex the Internet platform customers in the third quarter. I mentioned a couple of drivers of it. One is the difficult compare in our Asia-Pacific region, in particular, that had very robust media growth last Q3. And what we're seeing more and more is we're seeing more of our media customers that are -- were buying kind of a basic media delivery product. They're now upgrading. They're upgrading to a higher-performing web performance solution. So some of what you saw for growth deceleration in media, you saw corresponding growth acceleration in the Web Performance business as customers kind of shifted their products from a media product to a web product. The only thing that's important to note is that, that's going to happen. One of the reasons why we went to the divisional structure for the company, which is more of a division of customer lens, is if you look at our media kind of division, its growth rates were 12%. And so product migrations that go from kind of media to a web product, when you're looking at it from a customer basis, it doesn't matter. And so the growth rates -- and when you look at it across the division lens that we had strong growth rates in web customers. Web customers were 17% growth. We had strong growth rates in our media customers of 12%. It just so happened that our media products that we've seen a little bit of a shift of customers as they migrate from one product to another.

There are more notable events for what's capable for serving kind of live content across that many people. So it's really a display of capability more than it is a display of incremental revenue. So it's not as notable as kind of people might think. And I'm not going to provide guidance for 2017 for each one of these segments. But you're right, you may see a bit -- when you look at the product segments, you may see a bit of a share shift from kind of media to web. We'll have to see, that it -- I'd say, I think what we've seen, notably, is some large customers that have migrated from media products to a web product. I don't know how much more notable that's going to be going forward, but there's a possibility that you'll start to see a shift from media to Web Performance products. But again, when you look at it in a division lens, which, I think, is a more important way to look at it, that it's strong growth across all of the customer sets.

Increasingly, media companies really care about security, so they want all of their content to run through Kona Site Defender, and the entry-level delivery product there would be DSD, which is a web product. So what you see them doing is moving from basic object delivery, basic caching into a Performance and Security product and that's good. That's a good thing. It is a higher-margin business. As Jim said, it's stickier. And then from there, once they're more deeply on the platform, we can sell other capabilities; things like Image Manager, Bot Manager. So it's a good mix shift for us."

That said, we have great relationships in many major enterprises. And so it's easy for us to cross over. We do have folks that have special training around the new enterprise products. The beauty of both Enterprise Threat Protector and Enterprise Application Access is they are very easy to integrate and to turn on. And the value proposition is, I think, relatively easy to explain; much easier than things like Kona Site Defender and Ion, for that matter. So I'm very optimistic that it will be -- it will have success in being able to cross over with the enterprise products.

I do think it's going to be pressured in that we have had some large customers that have transitioned from buying a media product to now -- to a web product. So in that case, it will be pressured. But I still think this is a significant opportunity for growth in our media products and -- which is one of the reasons, again, going back to the divisional lens that we introduced a couple of quarters ago, that's one of the reasons why we group customers the way we have because, I think, seeing what those consumers are doing as a composite, I think, is a more important in meaningful way to look at it. And relative to the holiday season, I mean, you can look at some of the things that we do. You can look at announcements, announcements of -- it could be gaming releases. It could be announcements of things that are going to cause more consumption possibly of online activity. It could be the introduction of new offerings, potentially new offerings, for over-the-top bundles; things of that nature, looking at things like com score around what their predictions are going to be for the online e-commerce season.

Given the continued increase in size and scale of DDoS attacks, so can you just kind of give us an update on the competitive landscape, I guess, specifically, in terms of how quickly do you think the TAM is growing for DDoS mitigation? What customer segments are showing the strongest demand growth? And lastly, have you kind of begun to see an uptick in competition from either carriers or traditional software vendors that are angling more towards cloud-based security products?"

The traditional landscape has been dominated by companies that sell you devices that you install in your data center. And that just doesn't work anymore. The scale of the attacks makes it really impossible to defend yourself successfully that way. You just -- you can't afford enough, and you can't get enough connectivity with these large attacks. And what you need really is Akamai, because we have such large scale with our platform and where we place our servers at the edge of the Internet. Even the large cloud data centers cannot scale with these kinds of attacks. So we're uniquely well positioned to defend against the large attacks. I think every enterprise needs to worry about it. And I think there'll be increased awareness after Friday's attacks that this is a big deal. So I think there's tremendous upside in the TAM across, really, all of our customer segments. And that's just for the DoS attacks. Of course, we also sell the Kona Site Defender solution that adds application-layer defenses. That's where the bad guys are trying to come in and corrupt your website and trying to steal your confidential information. And then beyond that, as we talked about, we'll be entering the enterprise security space. And that's where the bad guys are trying to infect the employees with malware trying to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data such as e-mails. And that's potentially an even larger market down the road."
