First, last week, as you heard, I was elected Chairman of this great company. I want to start today by thanking Sumner, by thanking our Vice Chair, Shari Redstone and our Board of Directors for this great vote of confidence. It is indeed an honor to be the Chairman of CBS. 
I also want to say right upfront that I couldn't be more pleased and encouraged about the continued strength of the CBS Corporation. Our assets are performing extremely well and they are set out for a terrific future. I know you've been sorting through a lot of earnings analysis this week, and when you look at CBS, you'll see that we have a unique and compelling story. 
So now let's get to the results. I'm extremely pleased to tell you that we delivered a terrific fourth quarter. We posted our best results of 2015, and built on the momentum that we began to see in Q3. 
Fourth quarter revenue was up 6% to $3.9 billion, the highest quarter in the history of CBS. Operating income was also up 6% to $747 million, and was a fourth quarter record, and EPS was up 19% to $0.92, again, the best EPS we've ever achieved. 
The good news is these strong fourth quarter results are serving as a springboard for what is going to be an outstanding 2016. In the year ahead, we are set for broad-based strength across all of our revenue sources. 
First, advertising is as robust as we've seen in a long time. Scatter pricing is way up over last year's upfront, a fact that will be fresh in the minds of buyers as they approach this year's upfront in just a few months. This bodes very well for us, and we expect significant increases. 
On top of that, as you know, we just had the Super Bowl here in the first quarter, the third-highest rated broadcast in the history of television, and we have an extraordinary Grammy show coming up this Monday. And we will obviously benefit greatly from the presidential election, which will be extremely competitive for quite a while. This will give us a huge lift of political advertising to the third and especially the fourth quarters. 
Next, 2016 will be a landmark year in terms of retrans and reverse comp. Pricing has increased even faster than we anticipated, meaning we will pass $1 billion in revenue this year, well ahead of our previous outlook. And we are confident we will exceed $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020. 2016 will also be the year that our over-the-top subscription services begin to make a positive impact on our financial performance. Both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT continue to pace ahead of our expectations, including the most All Access sign-ups we've ever had this past Sunday, with many more to come next week, thanks to the Grammys. These new subs are bringing in younger audiences at economics that are much better for us. In addition, the response to our upcoming highly anticipated new Star Trek series, which will be seen only on All Access, except for the first episode, has been tremendous. And we are now looking at the possibility of utilizing CBS Studios to create additional exclusive programming for All Access. So stay tuned for more on that, and for updates about Showtime OTT as well. 
Next, 2016 will be a game-changing year for us internationally. Most significantly, our strategy of licensing the entire Showtime brand overseas has taken off. What started with a groundbreaking deal with Bell Media in Canada a year ago has expanded to the U.K, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy through a huge deal with Sky, and to Australia through a lucrative deal with Stan, and there are more of these to come. 
In addition to Showtime, demand for our CBS content has never been stronger around the world. For the first time, we now have a financially, substantial deal in China to license our CBS and Showtime programming. So from advertising to retrans and reverse comp, to over-the-top, to international licensing, 2016 is poised to be a banner year for the CBS Corporation. 
As you know, what makes us so successful is the strength of our content. It all starts with the CBS Television Network where we are #1 this season in all key demographics. Yes, 18 to 49, 25 to 54, viewers and households, CBS is #1 across the board with a little help from the Super Bowl. 
Across the entire multiplatform media landscape, CBS has the most-watched content in the business. This includes the #1 comedy, Big Bang Theory, and the #1 drama, NCIS. Both of these shows are watched by an average of more than 20 million people week after week. No other network has 2 series that reach anywhere near that kind of audience. 
The breadth of our programming is also key to our success. We are #1 every single night of the week this season with 5 of the top 10 shows on television. And when you count all of our viewers across platforms, CBS is up 6% from where it was 15 years ago. 
So we have steady, broad-based success of the network, and there's no one better at aggregating a mass audience. 
As we told you and as you now, CBS just had the biggest television event of them all, Super Bowl 50. As expected, the game drew a massive audience, on average throughout the night, we had 112 million viewers with millions more watching online. And we monetized them all. As a result, we significantly exceeded our financial targets, which once again will be a big boost to our first quarter. 
In fact, taken together with the Mayweather-Paquiao fight last May, we're now pretty certain that CBS has had the 2 biggest revenue days in the history of media. 
This past Sunday was also very special for us because CBS aired the very first Super Bowl on January 15, 1967. Clearly, the game has come a long way since then. In fact, a 62nd spot during that first game went for $85,000. This year, that same 60 seconds costs $10 million. Back in 1967, the #1 scripted show on television was The Andy Griffith Show on CBS. And today, the #1 scripted show on television is NCIS, also on the CBS. Some things, I guess, never change. 
In addition, we announced last week that we have retained the rights to Thursday Night Football for the next 2 years with 5 games per year in the first half of the season. 
We think this is the right amount of games at the right value at the right time of the year to kick off our schedule this fall. 
Meanwhile, the Super Bowl is also a terrific lead in for Sunday night's special broadcast of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, each of which had, by far, the biggest audiences they've ever had that night. Both of these shows continued to post big games in ad revenues, up double digits year-over-year. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is the only late-night show in this time period to grow in viewers and key demos from a year ago, and as the election nears, there's no one in late night that stands to capitalize on the opportunities from the rates more than Stephen. 
In addition, The Late Late Show with James Corden has become a social media sensation. At this point, every Carpool Karaoke segment we post is a viral hit. The one he did last month with Adele is now approaching 70 million streams, the most-watched YouTube clip ever by a late-night host. And since we now own both of these late-night shows, we can monetize all of these online viewing as well, a number that keeps getting bigger and bigger every week. 
Another area where we're seeing growth across platforms is the CBS News. Our flagship newscast are growing viewers faster than in any other network. CBS This Morning is attracting the biggest morning audience we've had in 28 years. The show's averaging 1 million more viewers than it did when we launched our new format 4 years ago, making it more profitable every single year with lots of upsides in this lucrative time period. 
The CBS Evening Show is also on a roll. During the quarter, the show delivered its largest audience in 9 years. Plus, on the weekends, we have the #1 morning news program with the CBS Sunday Morning; the #1 public affairs shows with Face the Nation; and of course, 60 Minutes, the #1 news program in all of television and of all time and a top 10 program nearly every single week. This includes last month's episode where Charlie Rose interviewed Sean Penn and brought in well more than 20 million viewers, leading to the largest nonsports audience for a single broadcast this year. 
As we grow our news viewers on air, we're also growing them online. CBS and our digital news network has attracted more viewers every single quarter since we launched in November '14. During the fourth quarter, we had nearly twice as many streams as we had in the third, and engagement levels are very high, which is important to advertisers, with the average viewer in session now exceeding 40 minutes.  Plus, these new viewers are 20 years younger. And the ones on broadcast or cable news clearly, this is where the future of news is going to be, and we are going to be there. 
Turning to cable. Showtime is doing spectacularly well, both creatively and in sub growth too. Our new series, Billions, is off to a terrific start, and I'm guessing many of you are contributing to that success. The premiere of Billions was the best-ever launch for a freshman Showtime series, and ratings have gone up dramatically each week since then. This is a genuine hit. And because of that, we've already announced that the show's been picked up for a second season. Once again, we own 100% of Billions, which has a very nice ring to it. Billions is the latest in an incredibly strong lineup of Showtime hits, with more to come, including the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks, which will debut next year. 
So from Homeland to The Affair to Ray Donovan to Masters of Sex, to Shameless, to Billions, to Twin Peaks, we have a murders role of original programming on Showtime. And each hit we launch is bringing a lift to Showtime's OTT service, which is growing its subscribers month after month. For example, when we premiered the most recent seasons of The Affair and Homeland in the fall, digital subs more than doubled, and now Billions is providing yet another surge. 
Growing OTT subs remains a top rating at Showtime and represents a tremendous financial opportunity for us. 
At Simon & Schuster, we turned in an extremely strong quarter, also thanks to the strength of our premium content. For the year, we had 249 New York Times bestsellers, with 32 reaching #1. And in '16, we'll be putting out new titles by some of the biggest names in publishing and entertainment, including Stephen King and Amy Schumer. And as we announced today, we are very excited to have the new Born to Run book by Bruce Springsteen, which we think will be the biggest title of the year. It's good to have the boss at CBS. 
Our big-ticket content is also success -- the key to our success at our local TV stations. Ad rates on the Super Bowl Sunday were up 45% from when we last had the game 3 years ago. And local sales for the Grammys on Monday are pacing to be up in the teens compared to last year. And of course, we are comparing what looks to be a record year in terms of political advertising. The crowd of candidates remains large, and there's a lot of uncertainty, which is just the way we will like it. Once again, based on Iowa and New Hampshire, this race is going on for a long, long time. And in addition to our TV stations, we also look forward to a lift from political dollars in radio this fall as well. 
As others in the industry have done, we've adjusted the book value of our radio business. This is an accounting move that doesn't limit our belief in the business as a high-margin vehicle that throws off a lot of cash for our shareholders. 
Also, in our Local Broadcasting segment, we have filed to have some of our television stations participate in the upcoming spectrum auction. It's a compelling option to have and could serve as a lucrative source of added cash for us down the road. 
So our fourth quarter and 2015 results were terrific. But what we're really excited about is the future. What others see as challenges, we see as opportunities. This is because CBS is unique in its standing as a media company that this poised to succeed no matter how the world changes. For 8 years running now, we have had more top 20 shows than any other media outlet regardless of platforms, add to that our major sports packages. Also live events like this Monday's Grammys and the millions and millions of viewers we have across our other dayparts, it becomes clear that CBS has to be part of any viable distribution package. In the 180 Channel traditional bundle, we will be there. In the skinny bundle of 15 channels, we will be there too, and for broadband-only homes, we will be there with All Access and Showtime OTT. So we have vast headroom to grow in the current ecosystem. And we have even bigger growth opportunities in an unbundled universe as well. 
Once again, I'm extremely pleased that we have an outstanding fourth quarter and across the corporation, and I'm even more excited that we are poised to have a phenomenal 2016. As always, we appreciate your support. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, CBS capped off 2015 with a record fourth quarter and we're building off that strength here in 2016. We are clearly firing on all cylinders. Advertising continues to benefit from a strong scatter marketplace. Retrans and reverse comp are set to hit $1 billion in revenue. International licensing has surpassed $1.5 billion and continues to grow, and our over-the-top services are expanding rapidly. 
We continue to set ourselves up for the future by investing in premium content and in our own distribution services. So as Les said, we are poised to succeed no matter how viewers choose to consume their content. 
Now let me give you some more details about our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was up 6% to an all-time high of $3.9 billion. And all 3 of our major revenue sources grew nicely. During the quarter, advertising was up 1% despite comping against strong political advertising from 2014. Network advertising led the way and grew 8% during the quarter, and gained momentum from the third quarter. And on a full year basis, underlying network advertising was up 4%. Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was up 13% for the fourth quarter as retrans and reverse comp continues to grow with each new deal that we do. And content licensing and distribution was up 16%, driven by our new deals to license our Showtime programming internationally, which once again underscores the strength of our strategy to own more of our content across our networks and monetize it globally. 
We also turned in operating income that grew 6% to $747 million, a fourth quarter record. And we achieved that increase even as we produced 14% more original programming hours at CBS Showtime and the CW. Once again, this investment in content sets us up for biggest monetization opportunities in the future. 
In addition, net earnings from continuing operations of $436 million was up 8% in the fourth quarter. And EPS was up 19% to $0.92, another all-time high, marking our 24th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
In terms of our results for the quarter, our EPS was adjusted to exclude 3 items to better reflect the performance of our business. They include: An after-tax restructuring charge of $16 million, which will have a short 12-month payback to it; a noncash impairment charge of $297 million, net of tax, to reduce the book value of our local radio group; and an after-tax gain of $128 million on the sale of an interactive business in China. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. In Entertainment, fourth quarter revenue of $2.5 billion was up 9%. And just like us our total company results, we posted strong growth across our key revenue sources here as well. As I mentioned, network advertising grew 8%, Retrans and reverse comp was up a strong 44%, and content and licensing increased 7%. 
Entertainment operating income for the fourth quarter came in at $347 million, up 37% due to strong growth in our high-margin revenue streams. As a result, our operating income margin expanded 300 basis points. 
At our Cable Networks segment, fourth quarter revenue grew 13% to $562 million, driven by Showtime's new international licensing deal, which covers 5 countries across Europe. As we continue to do more of these deals, we are creating guaranteed revenue streams that will benefit Showtime for years to come. 
In addition, we're also growing in the U.S. where our Showtime subs reached an all-time high at the end of 2015 of just under $24 million.  Our fourth quarter cable operating income came in at $228 million compared with $241 million in Q4 of 2014, primarily due to the mix of title sold and the benefit of the Bell Media deal from a year ago. 
As we've said consistently, margins should be looked at on a full year basis. For 2015, our margin here came in at 42%. And looking ahead to 2016, we expect our operating margins to expand at our Cable Networks segment. 
In Publishing, fourth quarter revenue of $233 million was up 8% as a result of our strong titles, demonstrating that this segment too is driven by good content. In addition, as more consumers are listening to audiobooks on their mobile devices, we are seeing strong sales in digital audio, which was up 35% during the quarter. Publishing operating income for the fourth quarter grew 36% to $34 million, and the operating income margin expanded 3 points to 15%.  Looking ahead to 2016, we expect to grow our operating margin here by strong title releases led by the Bruce Springsteen book Les just mentioned. 
In Local Broadcasting, fourth quarter revenue came in at $719 million compared with $785 million in the prior period when we had the midterm elections. However, nonpolitical revenue grew 1%, which is in line with what we told you on our last call. Telecom, food and beverage and Entertainment were the best-performing categories during the quarter. Local Broadcasting operating income for the fourth quarter was $232 million compared with $292 million a year ago. Our Local Broadcasting margin came in at 32%, and we expect our margin to expand in 2016 as a result of the cost-savings initiatives we've been implementing as well as political advertising. 
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. For all of 2015, free cash flow was $1.2 billion, up from $1 billion from 2014. We ended 2015 with $323 million of cash on hand and a gross debt of $8.4 billion, which yields a prudent 2.7x leverage ratio. Also for the year, we repurchased nearly 52 million shares of our stock for $2.8 billion. We have $2 billion remaining on our share buyback program, which we expect to complete in 2016.  Returning value to our shareholders remains a key priority for us. 
Now let me give you a few observations of what we see ahead. For advertising, the momentum that started in Q3 of 2015 continues to build here in Q1 of 2016. At the network, we expect a very strong first quarter driven by an extra NFL playoff game, Super Bowl 50 and the Grammys as well as growth in the scatter marketplace, which continues to benefit us because of the inventory we held back from last year's upfront. Local Broadcasting will also get a lift from the Super Bowl and is pacing to be up high single digits in the first quarter. In content licensing, we continue to replenish the pipeline. We have lots of young series across our networks that we have not yet monetized domestically, including NCIS New Orleans, Scorpion and Limitless from CBS, as well as Ray Donovan and The Affair and Billions from Showtime. So with so much choice out there, only the best content will stand out, and we have the content that will deliver that. 
Also, as you've heard, we expect to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp this year. Up until this point, much of our growth in this category has been driven from retrans, but reverse comp is now playing a very big role in this growth story as we make our way towards achieving $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020. 
So in summary, we just completed a very strong quarter, and we are poised for a record-setting 2016. Looking beyond that, investing in our future as a content company, remains the best thing we can do for our shareholders. Our ability to offer a concentrated value proposition with the best in news, sports and entertainment is what makes CBS stand out from the rest. It's the reason we can thrive in a traditional bundled universe and why we're positioned to succeed in an unbundled à la carte world as well. And then global opportunities are huge. So we feel very good about where we're headed, and we look forward to discussing our results with you on our next call in early May. 
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

The reason we are so encouraged, it was concern -- the last upfront that the numbers, even though CPMs were up mid-single digits, volume was down, there was a little bit of nervousness how is the digital revolution taking over. And as we saw beginning in the third quarter when scatter went up in terms of high teens we're talking about, and that continues into the fourth quarter and continuing to the first quarter. So once again, we always like to say that a guy who bought us from CBS in October paid like nearly 20% more than it would have if we would have bought from us in July. As this momentum continues, and once again, tightened by the great sporting events we have, the Grammy awards, political advertising locally, but as the network, the scatter is getting better every month. So as we head into the upfront, we are fairly certain and once again, Joe and Ross will tell me, so I don't give numbers, but I think it's going to be substantially higher than it has been before, than it has been in the past year. And I think it generally follows that when scatter is this strong, the upfront continues to be strong, and we're anticipating that now. In terms of development. There's really nothing uniquely different now. Obviously, we have a new President of Entertainment who has a slightly different taste than Nina, and Glenn is great. We are ordering around the same number of pilots as we have in previous years. I would say, we own a lot more than we ever had before. There are only a couple that we are not -- we don't own at least half, and an awful lot of them, we own 100% of that. Because as you see, the back end becomes as important, if not more, than the front end. And that kind of shows that we're developing once again at this point. They're across the board from procedurals that have worked very well with us to more soap-y, serialized shows, which now leads the SVOD players, buying them and paying more for them. So it really is too early to tell. I can tell you, I'm very pleased with the development. We don't need that much because we have a great stability in our #1 schedule. So I've read all the scripts, and we're casting and will start production shortly."

Obviously, again, political driving it, not to the degree as it's going to benefit local television stations, but there will certainly be a benefit in that. We're obviously in the middle of the year last year, we changed our management team as well. So again, we're expecting margin expansion in growth. Again, it's also a very -- again, low capital-intensive business. And so we do benefit a lot from significant cash flow that they generate. As far as the cable numbers. This sub-growth there, again, as we said, ended the year at an all-time high. And so if the benefit of owning shows obviously is high margins. So when we sell those shows and make them available, we sell Dexter, a lot of that profit falls in that quarter. So they will have some lumpiness on the mix of those titles of what year was it sold, was there 8 seasons, 6 seasons, 2 seasons. So I think that obviously does cause some volatility to the numbers. But again, the high cliff problem is how high is up. And so it is in a much better position we are in generating and take that and reinvesting it into the business to do more and more original series. So that really gives us the ability to do that. So we like owning it, and I know you guys would like a steady growth rate and just plug it in your model and have it go every quarter, but that's why we said we look at it on a full year basis and it usually evens out."

First, last week, as you heard, I was elected Chairman of this great company. I want to start today by thanking Sumner, by thanking our Vice Chair, Shari Redstone and our Board of Directors for this great vote of confidence. It is indeed an honor to be the Chairman of CBS. 
I also want to say right upfront that I couldn't be more pleased and encouraged about the continued strength of the CBS Corporation. Our assets are performing extremely well and they are set out for a terrific future. I know you've been sorting through a lot of earnings analysis this week, and when you look at CBS, you'll see that we have a unique and compelling story. 
So now let's get to the results. I'm extremely pleased to tell you that we delivered a terrific fourth quarter. We posted our best results of 2015, and built on the momentum that we began to see in Q3. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6% to $3.9 billion, the highest quarter in the history of CBS. Operating income was also up 6% to $747 million, and was a fourth quarter record, and EPS was up 19% to $0.92, again, the best EPS we've ever achieved.
The good news is these strong fourth quarter results are serving as the springboard for what is going to be an outstanding 2016. In the year ahead, we are set for broad-based strength across all of our revenue sources. First, advertising is as robust as we've seen in a long time. Scatter pricing is way up over last year's upfront, a fact that will be fresh in the minds of buyers as they approach this year's upfront in just a few months. This bodes very well for us, and we expect significant increases. 
On top of that, as you know, we just had the Super Bowl here in the first quarter, the third-highest rated broadcast in the history of television, and we have an extraordinary Grammy show coming up this Monday. And we will obviously benefit greatly from the presidential election, which will be extremely competitive for quite a while. This will give us a huge lift of political advertising to the third and especially the fourth quarters.
Next, 2016 will be a landmark year in terms of retrans and reverse comp. Pricing has increased even faster than we anticipated, meaning we will pass $1 billion in revenue this year, well ahead of our previous outlook. And we are confident we will exceed $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020. 2016 will also be the year that our over-the-top subscription services begin to make a positive impact on our financial performance. Both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT continued to pace ahead of our expectations, including the most All Access sign-ups we've ever had this past Sunday, with many more to come next week, thanks to the Grammys. These new subs are bringing in younger audiences at economics that are much better for us. In addition, the response to our upcoming highly anticipated new Star Trek series, which will be seen only on All Access, except for the first episode, has been tremendous. And we are now looking at the possibility of utilizing CBS Studios to create additional exclusive programming for All Access. So stay tuned for more on that, and for updates about Showtime OTT as well.
 
Next, 2016 will be a game-changing year for us internationally. Most significantly, our strategy of licensing the entire Showtime brand overseas has taken off. What started with a groundbreaking deal with Bell Media in Canada a year ago has expanded to the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, through a huge deal with Sky; and to Australia through a lucrative deal with Stan, and there are more of these to come.
 
In addition to Showtime, demand for our CBS content has never been stronger around the world. For the first time, we now have a financially substantial deal in China to license our CBS and Showtime programming. So from advertising to retrans and reverse comp, to over-the-top, to international licensing, 2016 is poised to be a banner year for the CBS Corporation.
 
As you know, what makes us so successful is the strength of our content. It all starts with the CBS Television Network, where we are #1 this season in all key demographics. Yes, 18 to 49, 25 to 54, viewers and households, CBS is #1 across the board with a little help from the Super Bowl.
 
Across the entire multiplatform media landscape, CBS has the most-watched content in the business. This includes the #1 comedy, Big Bang Theory, and the #1 drama, NCIS. Both of these shows are watched by an average of more than 20 million people week after week. No other network has 2 series that reach anywhere near that kind of audience.
 
The breadth of our programming is also key to our success. We are #1 every single night of the week this season with 5 of the top 10 shows on television. And when you count all of our viewers across platforms, CBS is up 6% from where it was 15 years ago. So we have steady, broad-based success with the network, and there's no one better at aggregating a mass audience.
 
As we told you and as you now, CBS just had the biggest television event of them all, Super Bowl 50. As expected, the game drew a massive audience, on average throughout the night, we had 112 million viewers with millions more watching online. And we monetized them all. As a result, we've significantly exceeded our financial targets, which once again will be a big boost to our first quarter.
 
In fact, taken together with the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight last May, we're now pretty certain that CBS has had the 2 biggest revenue days in the history of media. This past Sunday was also very special for us because CBS aired the very first Super Bowl on January 15, 1967. Clearly, the game has come a long way since then. In fact, a 62nd spot during that first game went for $85,000. This year, that same 60 seconds costs $10 million. Back in 1967, the #1 scripted show on television was The Andy Griffith Show on CBS. And today, the #1 scripted show on television is NCIS, also on CBS. Some things, I guess, never change.
 
In addition, we announced last week that we have retained the rights to Thursday Night Football for the next 2 years with 5 games per year in the first half of the season. We think this is the right amount of games at the right value at the right time of the year to kick off our schedule this fall.
Meanwhile, the Super Bowl is also a terrific lead-in for Sunday night's special broadcast of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, each of which had, by far, the biggest audiences they've ever had that night. Both of these shows continued to post big gains in ad revenues, up double digits year-over-year. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is the only late-night show in this time period to grow in viewers and key demos from a year ago, and as the election nears, there is no one in late night that stands to capitalize on the opportunities from the rates more than Stephen.
In addition, The Late Late Show with James Corden has become a social media sensation. At this point, every Carpool Karaoke segment he post is a viral hit. The one he did last month with Adele is now approaching 70 million streams, the most-watched YouTube clip ever by a late-night host. And since we now own both of these late-night shows, we can monetize all of these online viewing as well, a number that keeps getting bigger and bigger every week. 
Another area where we're seeing growth across platforms is with CBS News. Our flagship newscast are growing viewers faster than in any other network. CBS This Morning is attracting the biggest morning audience we've had in 28 years. The show's averaging 1 million more viewers than it did when we launched our new format 4 years ago, making it more profitable every single year with lots of upsides in this lucrative time period. 
The CBS Evening News is also on a roll. During the quarter, the show delivered its largest audience in 9 years. Plus, on the weekends, we have the #1 morning news program with CBS Sunday Morning; the #1 public affairs shows with Face the Nation; and of course, 60 Minutes, the #1 news program in all of television and of all time and a top 10 program nearly every single week. This includes last month's episode where Charlie Rose interviewed Sean Penn and brought in well more than 20 million viewers, leading to the largest nonsports audience for a single broadcast this year. 
As we grow our news viewers on air, we're also growing them online. CBS and our digital news network has attracted more viewers every single quarter since we launched in November '14. During the fourth quarter, we had nearly twice as many streams as we had in the third, and engagement levels are very high, which is important to advertisers, with the average viewer session now exceeding 40 minutes. Plus, these new viewers are 20 years younger than the ones on broadcast or cable news. Clearly, this is where the future of news is going to be, and we are going to be there. 
Turning to cable. Showtime is doing spectacularly well, both creatively and in sub growth too. Our new series, Billions, is off to a terrific start, and I'm guessing many of you are contributing to that success. The premiere of Billions was the best-ever launch for a freshman Showtime series, and ratings have gone up dramatically each week since then. This is a genuine hit. And because of that, we've already announced that the show's been picked up for a second season. Once again, we own 100% of Billions, which has a very nice ring to it. Billions is the latest in an incredibly strong lineup of Showtime hits, with more to come, including the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks, which will debut next year. 
So from Homeland to The Affair to Ray Donovan to Masters of Sex, to Shameless, to Billions, to Twin Peaks, we have a Murderers' Row of original programming on Showtime. And each hit we launch is bringing a lift to Showtime's OTT service, which is growing its subscribers month after month. For example, when we premiered the most recent seasons of The Affair and Homeland in the fall, digital subs more than doubled, and now Billions is providing yet another surge. Growing OTT subs remains a top priority at Showtime and represents a tremendous financial opportunity for us.
At Simon & Schuster, we turned in an extremely strong quarter, also thanks to the strength of our premium content. For the year, we had 249 New York Times bestsellers, with 32 reaching #1. And in '16, we'll be putting out new titles by some of the biggest names in publishing and entertainment, including Stephen King and Amy Schumer. And as we announced today, we're very excited to have the new Born to Run book by Bruce Springsteen, which we think will be the biggest title of the year. It's good to have the boss at CBS.
Our big-ticket content is also the success -- the key to our success at our local TV stations. Ad rates on the Super Bowl Sunday were up 45% from when we last had the game 3 years ago. And local sales for the Grammys on Monday are pacing to be up in the teens compared to last year. And of course, we are preparing what looks to be a record year in terms of political advertising. The crowd of candidates remains large, and there's a lot of uncertainty, which is just the way we will like it. Once again, based on Iowa and New Hampshire, this race is going on for a long, long time. And in addition to our TV stations, we also look forward to a lift from political dollars in radio this fall as well.
As others in the industry have done, we've adjusted the book value of our radio business. This is an accounting move that doesn't limit our belief in the business as a high-margin vehicle that throws off a lot of cash for our shareholders. Also, in our Local Broadcasting segment, we have filed to have some of our television stations participate in the upcoming spectrum auction. It's a compelling option to have and could serve as a lucrative source of added cash for us down the road.
So our fourth quarter and 2015 results were terrific. But what we're really excited about is the future. What others see as challenges, we see as opportunities. This is because CBS is unique in its standing as a media company that this poised to succeed no matter how the world changes. For 8 years running now, we have had more top 20 shows than any other media outlet regardless of platforms, add to that our major sports packages. Also live events like this Monday's Grammys and the millions and millions of viewers we have across our other dayparts, it becomes clear that CBS has to be part of any viable distribution package. In the 180 channel traditional bundle, we will be there. In the skinny bundle of 15 channels, we will be there too, and for broadband-only homes, we will be there with All Access and Showtime OTT. So we have vast headroom to grow in the current ecosystem. And we have even bigger growth opportunities in an unbundled universe as well.
Once again, I'm extremely pleased that we have an outstanding fourth quarter and across the corporation, and I'm even more excited that we are poised to have a phenomenal 2016. As always, we appreciate your support. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, CBS capped off 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and we're building off that strength here in 2016. We are clearly firing on all cylinders. Advertising continues to benefit from a strong scatter marketplace. Retrans and reverse comp are set to hit $1 billion in revenue. International licensing has surpassed $1.5 billion and continues to grow, and our over-the-top services are expanding rapidly. We continue to set ourselves up for the future by investing in premium content and in our own distribution services. So as Les said, we are poised to succeed no matter how viewers choose to consume their content.
Now let me give you some more details about our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was up 6% to an all-time high of $3.9 billion. And all 3 of our major revenue sources grew nicely. During the quarter, advertising was up 1% despite comping against strong local political advertising from 2014. Network advertising led the way and grew 8% during the quarter, and gained momentum from the third quarter. And on a full year basis, underlying network advertising was up 4%. Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was up 13% for the fourth quarter as retrans and reverse comp continues to grow with each new deal that we do. And content licensing and distribution was up 16%, driven by our new deals to license our Showtime programming internationally, which once again underscores the strength of our strategy to own more of our content across our networks and monetize it globally.
We also turned in operating income that grew 6% to $747 million, a fourth quarter record. And we achieved that increase even as we produced 14% more original programming hours at CBS Showtime and the CW. Once again, this investment in content sets us up for biggest monetization opportunities in the future. In addition, net earnings from continuing operations of $436 million was up 8% in the fourth quarter. And EPS was up 19% to $0.92, another all-time high, marking our 24th consecutive quarter of EPS growth.
In terms of our results for the quarter, our EPS was adjusted to exclude 3 items to better reflect the performance of our business. They include: An after-tax restructuring charge of $16 million, which will have a short 12-month payback to it; a noncash impairment charge of $297 million, net of tax, to reduce the book value of our local radio group; and an after-tax gain of $128 million on the sale of an interactive business in China. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. In Entertainment, fourth quarter revenue of $2.5 billion was up 9%. And just like us our total company results, we posted strong growth across our key revenue sources here as well. As I mentioned, network advertising grew 8%. Retrans and reverse comp was up a strong 44%, and content and licensing increased 7%. Entertainment operating income for the fourth quarter came in at $347 million, up 37% due to strong growth in our high-margin revenue streams. As a result, our operating income margin expanded 300 basis points. 
At our Cable Networks segment, fourth quarter revenue grew 13% to $562 million, driven by Showtime's new international licensing deal, which covers 5 countries across Europe. As we continue to do more of these deals, we are creating guaranteed revenue streams that will benefit Showtime for years to come.
In addition, we're also growing in the U.S. where our Showtime subs reached an all-time high at the end of 2015 of just under $24 million. Our fourth quarter cable operating income came in at $228 million compared with $241 million in Q4 of 2014, primarily due to the mix of title sold and the benefit of the Bell Media deal from a year ago. As we've said consistently, margins should be looked at on a full year basis. For 2015, our margin here came in at 42%. And looking ahead to 2016, we expect our operating margins to expand at our Cable Networks segment. 
In Publishing, fourth quarter revenue of $233 million was up 8% as a result of our strong titles, demonstrating that this segment too is driven by good content. In addition, as more consumers are listening to audiobooks on their mobile devices, we are seeing strong sales in digital audio, which was up 35% during the quarter. Publishing operating income for the fourth quarter grew 36% to $34 million, and the operating income margin expanded 3 points to 15%. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect to grow our operating margin here by strong title releases led by the Bruce Springsteen book Les just mentioned.
In Local Broadcasting, fourth quarter revenue came in at $719 million compared with $785 million in the prior period when we had the midterm elections. However, nonpolitical revenue grew 1%, which is in line with what we told you on our last call. Telecom, food and beverage and Entertainment were the best-performing categories during the quarter. Local Broadcasting operating income for the fourth quarter was $232 million compared with $292 million a year ago. Our Local Broadcasting margin came in at 32%, and we expect our margin to expand in 2016 as a result of the cost-savings initiatives we've been implementing as well as political advertising.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. For all of 2015, free cash flow was $1.2 billion, up from $1 billion from 2014. We ended 2015 with $323 million of cash on hand and a gross debt of $8.4 billion, which yields a prudent 2.7x leverage ratio. Also for the year, we repurchased nearly 52 million shares of our stock for $2.8 billion. We have $2 billion remaining on our share buyback program, which we expect to complete in 2016. Returning value to our shareholders remains a key priority for us.
Now let me give you a few observations of what we see ahead. For advertising, the momentum that started in Q3 of 2015 continues to build here in Q1 of 2016. At the network, we expect a very strong first quarter driven by an extra NFL playoff game, Super Bowl 50 and the Grammys as well as growth in the scatter marketplace, which continues to benefit us because of the inventory we held back from last year's upfront. Local Broadcasting will also get a lift from the Super Bowl and is pacing to be up high single digits in the first quarter. 
In content licensing, we continue to replenish the pipeline. We have lots of young series across our networks that we have not yet monetized domestically, including NCIS: New Orleans, Scorpion and Limitless from CBS, as well as Ray Donovan, The Affair and Billions from Showtime. So with so much choice out there, only the best content will stand out, and we have the content that will deliver that. 
Also, as you've heard, we expect to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp this year. Up until this point, much of our growth in this category has been driven from retrans, but reverse comp is now playing a very big role in this growth story as we make our way towards exceeding $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020.
So in summary, we just completed a very strong quarter, and we are poised for a record-setting 2016. Looking beyond that, investing in our future as a content company, remains the best thing we can do for our shareholders. Our ability to offer a concentrated value proposition with the best in news, sports and entertainment is what makes CBS stand out from the rest. It's the reason we can thrive in a traditional bundled universe and why we're positioned to succeed in an unbundled à la carte world as well. And then global opportunities are huge. So we feel very good about where we're headed, and we look forward to discussing our results with you on our next call in early May. 
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

So can you give us a sense of your expectation around timing and monetization for those big CBS shows. And I don't know if you'd want to talk about it, but would you be able to say you think you can grow licensing in 2016, particularly when you think about the deals you've done on Showtime in Europe for example? And then unrelated, Les, we've gotten this question a lot, maybe you could touch on it.

And again, I will also tell you that whenever we budget a revenue type, we've never, in our professional career, budgeted anything to go down. So I think we have high expectations for that, and it's because of the content pipeline. We have hundreds of episodes yet to be monetized.

The reason we are so encouraged, it was concern at the last upfront that the numbers, even though CPMs were up mid-single digits, volume was down, there was a little bit of nervousness, oh gee, is the digital revolution taking over? And as we saw beginning in the third quarter when scatter went up in terms of high teens we're talking about, and that continues into the fourth quarter and continuing to the first quarter. So once again, we always like to say that a guy who bought us from CBS in October paid like nearly 20% more than it would have if we would have bought from us in July. As this momentum continues, and once again, tightened by the great sporting events we have, the Grammy awards, political advertising locally, but at the network, the scatter is getting better every month. So as we head into the upfront, we are fairly certain and once again, Jo Ann Ross will kill me, so I don't give numbers, but I think it's going to be substantially higher than it has been before, than it has been in the past year. And I think it generally follows that with scatter is this strong, the upfront continues to be strong, and we're anticipating that now. In terms of development. There is really nothing uniquely different now. Obviously, we have a new President of Entertainment, who has a slightly different taste than Nina, and Glenn is great. We are ordering around the same number of pilots as we have in previous years. I would say, we own a lot more than we ever have before. There are only a couple that we are not -- we don't own at least half, and an awful lot of them, we own 100% of that. Because as you see, the back end becomes as important, if not more, than the front end. And that kind of shows that we're developing once again at this point, they're across the board from procedurals that have worked very well with us to more soap-y, serialized shows, which now with the SVOD players, buying them and paying more for them. So it really is too early to tell. I can tell you, I'm very pleased with the development. We don't need that much because we have a great stability in our #1 schedule. So I've read all the scripts, and we're casting and will start production shortly."

And if you are, do you think you would price it at $9.99? Or would you do something below $9.99 to sort of entice better adoption of it as kind of as Hulu does?

I would say, again, we probably got about $80 million of cost out of the local segment that we'll see kind of build throughout the year really probably more back half. And as far as the revenue goes, I think again, you're going to see radio, I think, built sequentially. Obviously, again, political driving it, not to the degree as it's going to benefit local television stations, but there will certainly be a benefit in that. We're obviously in the middle of the year. Last year, we changed our management team as well. So again, we're expecting margin expansion and growth. Again, it's also a very -- again, low capital-intensive business. And so we do benefit a lot from significant cash flow that they generate. As far as the cable numbers. The sub-growth there, again, as we said, ended the year at an all-time high. And so if the benefit of owning shows obviously is high margins, so when we sell those shows and make them available, we sell Dexter, a lot of that profit falls in that quarter. So they will have some lumpiness on the mix of those titles of what year was it sold, was there 8 seasons, 6 seasons, 2 seasons. So I think that obviously does cause some volatility to the numbers. But again, the high cliff problem is how high is up. And so it is in a much better position we are in generating and take that and reinvesting it into the business to do more and more original series. So that really gives us the ability to do that. So we like owning it, and I know you guys would like a steady growth rate and just plug it into your model and have it go every quarter, but that's why we said we look at it on a full year basis and it usually evens out."

First, last week, as you heard, I was elected Chairman of this great company. I want to start today by thanking Sumner, by thanking our Vice Chair, Shari Redstone, and our Board of Directors for this great vote of confidence. It is indeed an honor to be the Chairman of CBS. 
I also want to say right up front that I couldn't be more pleased and encouraged about the continued strength of the CBS Corporation. Our assets are performing extremely well and they are set up for a terrific future. I know you've been sorting through a lot of earnings analysis this week, and when you look at CBS, you'll see that we have a unique and compelling story. 
So now let's get to the results. I'm extremely pleased to tell you that we delivered a terrific fourth quarter. We posted our best results of 2015 and built on the momentum that we began to see in Q3. Fourth quarter revenue was up 6% to $3.9 billion, the highest quarter in the history of CBS. Operating income was also up 6% to $747 million and was a fourth quarter record, and EPS was up 19% to $0.92, again, the best EPS we've ever achieved.
The good news is these strong fourth quarter results are serving as the springboard for what is going to be an outstanding 2016. In the year ahead we are set for broad-based strength across all of our revenue sources. First, advertising is as robust as we've seen in a long time. Scatter pricing is way up over last year's upfront, a fact that will be fresh in the minds of buyers as they approach this year's upfront in just a few months. This bodes very well for us, and we expect significant increases. 
On top of that, as you know, we just had the Super Bowl here in the first quarter, the third-highest rated broadcast in the history of television, and we have an extraordinary Grammy show coming up this Monday. And we will obviously benefit greatly from the presidential election, which will be extremely competitive for quite a while. This will give us a huge lift of political advertising to the third and especially the fourth quarters.
Next, 2016 will be a landmark year in terms of retrans and reverse comp. Pricing has increased even faster than we anticipated, meaning we will pass $1 billion in revenue this year, well ahead of our previous outlook. And we are confident we will exceed $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020. 2016 will also be the year that our over-the-top subscription services begin to make a positive impact on our financial performance. Both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT continued to pace ahead of our expectations, including the most All Access sign-ups we've ever had this past Sunday, with many more to come next week, thanks to the Grammys. These new subs are bringing in younger audiences at economics that are much better for us. In addition, the response to our upcoming highly anticipated new Star Trek series, which will be seen only on All Access, except for the first episode, has been tremendous. And we are now looking at the possibility of utilizing CBS Studios to create additional exclusive programming for All Access. So stay tuned for more on that, and for updates about Showtime OTT as well.
 
Next, 2016 will be a game-changing year for us internationally. Most significantly, our strategy of licensing the entire Showtime brand overseas has taken off. What started with a groundbreaking deal with Bell Media in Canada a year ago has expanded to the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, through a huge deal with Sky; and to Australia through a lucrative deal with Stan, and there are more of these to come.
 
In addition to Showtime, demand for our CBS content has never been stronger around the world. For the first time, we now have a financially substantial deal in China to license our CBS and Showtime programming. So from advertising to retrans and reverse comp, to over-the-top, to international licensing, 2016 is poised to be a banner year for the CBS Corporation.
 
As you know, what makes us so successful is the strength of our content. It all starts with the CBS Television Network, where we are #1 this season in all key demographics. Yes, 18 to 49, 25 to 54, viewers and households, CBS is #1 across the board with a little help from the Super Bowl.
 
Across the entire multiplatform media landscape, CBS has the most-watched content in the business. This includes the #1 comedy, Big Bang Theory, and the #1 drama, NCIS. Both of these shows are watched by an average of more than 20 million people week after week. No other network has 2 series that reach anywhere near that kind of audience.
 
The breadth of our programming is also key to our success. We are #1 every single night of the week this season with 5 of the top 10 shows on television. And when you count all of our viewers across platforms, CBS is up 6% from where it was 15 years ago. So we have steady, broad-based success at the network, and there's no one better at aggregating a mass audience.
 
As we told you and as you know, CBS just aired the biggest television event of them all, Super Bowl 50. As expected, the game drew a massive audience. On average throughout the night we had 112 million viewers with millions more watching online. And we monetized them all. As a result, we've significantly exceeded our financial targets, which once again will be a big boost to our first quarter.
 
In fact, taken together with the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight last May, we're now pretty certain that CBS has had the 2 biggest revenue days in the history of media. This past Sunday was also very special for us because CBS aired the very first Super Bowl on January 15, 1967. Clearly the game has come a long way since then. In fact, a 60-second spot during that first game went for $85,000. This year, that same 60 seconds cost $10 million. Back in 1967, the #1 scripted show on television was The Andy Griffith Show on CBS. And today, the #1 scripted show on television is NCIS, also on CBS. Some things, I guess, never change.
 
In addition, we announced last week that we have retained the rights to Thursday Night Football for the next 2 years with 5 games per year in the first half of the season. We think this is the right amount of games at the right value at the right time of the year to kick off our schedule this fall.
Meanwhile, the Super Bowl was also a terrific lead-in for Sunday night's special broadcast of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, each of which had, by far, the biggest audiences they've ever had that night. Both of these shows continue to post big gains in ad revenues, up double digits year-over-year. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is the only late-night show in this time period to grow in viewers and key demos from a year ago. And as the election nears, there is no one in late night that stands to capitalize on the opportunities from the race more than Stephen.
In addition, The Late Late Show with James Corden has become a social media sensation. At this point, every Carpool Karaoke segment he posts is a viral hit. The one he did last month with Adele is now approaching 70 million streams, the most-watched YouTube clip ever by a late-night host. And since we now own both of these late-night shows, we can monetize all of this online viewing as well, a number that keeps getting bigger and bigger every week. 
Another area where we're seeing growth across platforms is with CBS News. Our flagship newscasts are growing viewers faster than at any other network. CBS This Morning is attracting the biggest morning audience we've had in 28 years. The show's averaging 1 million more viewers than it did when we launched our new format 4 years ago, making it more profitable every single year with lots of upsides in this lucrative time period. 
The CBS Evening News is also on a roll. During the quarter the show delivered its largest audience in 9 years. Plus, on the weekends, we have the #1 morning news program with CBS Sunday Morning; the #1 public affairs show with Face the Nation; and of course 60 Minutes, the #1 news program in all of television and of all time and a top 10 program nearly every single week. This includes last month's episode where Charlie Rose interviewed Sean Penn and brought in well more than 20 million viewers, leading to the largest nonsports audience for a single broadcast this season. 
As we grow our news viewers on air, we're also growing them online. CBS and our digital news network has attracted more viewers every single quarter since we launched in November of '14. During the fourth quarter we had nearly twice as many streams as we had in the third, and engagement levels are very high, which is important to advertisers, with the average viewing session now exceeding 40 minutes. Plus, these new viewers are 20 years younger than the ones on broadcast or cable news. Clearly this is where the future of news is going to be, and we are going to be there. 
Turning to cable. Showtime is doing spectacularly well, both creatively and in sub growth too. Our new series, Billions, is off to a terrific start, and I'm guessing many of you are contributing to that success. The premiere of Billions was the best-ever launch for a freshman Showtime series, and ratings have gone up dramatically each week since then. This is a genuine hit. And because of that, we've already announced that the show's been picked up for a second season. Once again, we own 100% of Billions, which has a very nice ring to it. Billions is the latest in an incredibly strong lineup of Showtime hits, with more to come, including the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks, which will debut next year. 
So from Homeland to The Affair to Ray Donovan to Masters of Sex, to Shameless, to Billions, to Twin Peaks, we have a Murderers' Row of original programming on Showtime. And each hit we launch is bringing a lift to Showtime's OTT service, which is growing its subscribers month after month. For example, when we premiered the most recent seasons of The Affair and Homeland in the fall, digital subs more than doubled, and now Billions is providing yet another surge. Growing OTT subs remains a top priority at Showtime and represents a tremendous financial opportunity for us.
At Simon & Schuster, we turned in an extremely strong quarter, also thanks to the strength of our premium content. For the year, we had 249 New York Times bestsellers, with 32 reaching #1. And in '16, we'll be putting out new titles by some of the biggest names in publishing and entertainment, including Stephen King and Amy Schumer. And as we announced today, we're very excited to have the new Born to Run book by Bruce Springsteen, which we think will be the biggest title of the year. It's good to have the Boss at CBS.
Our big-ticket content is also the success -- the key to our success at our local TV stations. Ad rates on the Super Bowl Sunday were up 45% from when we last had the game 3 years ago. And local sales for the Grammys on Monday are pacing to be up in the teens compared to last year. And of course we are preparing what looks to be a record year in terms of political advertising. The crowd of candidates remains large, and there's a lot of uncertainty, which is just the way we like it. Once again, based on Iowa and New Hampshire, this race is going on for a long, long time. And in addition to our TV stations, we also look forward to a lift from political dollars in radio this fall as well.
As others in the industry have done, we've adjusted the book value of our radio business. This is an accounting move that doesn't limit our belief in the business as a high-margin vehicle that throws off a lot of cash for our shareholders. Also in our local broadcasting segment, we have filed to have some of our television stations participate in the upcoming spectrum auction. It's a compelling option to have and could serve as a lucrative source of added cash for us down the road.
So our fourth quarter and 2015 results were terrific. But what we're really excited about is the future. What others see as challenges, we see as opportunities. This is because CBS is unique in its standing as a media company that is poised to succeed no matter how the world changes. For 8 years running now, we have had more top 20 shows than any other media outlet regardless of platforms. Add to that our major sports packages, also live events like this Monday's Grammys, and the millions and millions of viewers we have across our other dayparts, it becomes clear that CBS has to be part of any viable distribution package. In the 180-channel traditional bundle, we will be there. In the skinny bundle of 15 channels, we will be there, too. And for broadband-only homes, we will be there with All Access and Showtime OTT. So we have vast headroom to grow in the current ecosystem. And we have even bigger growth opportunities in an unbundled universe as well.
Once again, I'm extremely pleased that we had an outstanding fourth quarter and across the corporation, and I'm even more excited that we are poised to have a phenomenal 2016. As always, we appreciate your support. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, CBS capped off 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and we're building off that strength here in 2016. We are clearly firing on all cylinders. Advertising continues to benefit from a strong scatter marketplace. Retrans and reverse comp are set to hit $1 billion in revenue. International licensing has surpassed $1.5 billion and continues to grow. And our over-the-top services are expanding rapidly. We continue to set ourselves up for the future by investing in premium content and in our own distribution services. So as Les said, we are poised to succeed no matter how viewers choose to consume their content.
Now let me give you some more details about our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was up 6% to an all-time high of $3.9 billion. And all 3 of our major revenue sources grew nicely. During the quarter, advertising was up 1% despite comping against strong local political advertising from 2014. Network advertising led the way and grew 8% during the quarter and gained momentum from the third quarter. And on a full year basis, underlying network advertising was up 4%. Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was up 13% for the fourth quarter as retrans and reverse comp continues to grow with each new deal that we do. And content licensing and distribution was up 16%, driven by our new deals to license our Showtime programming internationally, which once again underscores the strength of our strategy to own more of our content across our networks and monetize it globally.
We also turned in operating income that grew 6% to $747 million, a fourth quarter record. And we achieved that increase even as we produced 14% more original programming hours at CBS Showtime and the CW. Once again, this investment in content sets us up for bigger monetization opportunities in the future. In addition, net earnings from continuing operations of $436 million was up 8% in the fourth quarter. And EPS was up 19% to $0.92, another all-time high, marking our 24th consecutive quarter of EPS growth.
In terms of our results for the quarter, our EPS was adjusted to exclude 3 items to better reflect the performance of our business. They include: an after-tax restructuring charge of $16 million, which will have a short 12-month payback to it; a noncash impairment charge of $297 million, net of tax, to reduce the book value of our local radio group; and an after-tax gain of $128 million on the sale of an interactive business in China. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. In Entertainment, fourth quarter revenue of $2.5 billion was up 9%. And just like our total company results, we posted strong growth across our key revenue sources here as well. As I mentioned, network advertising grew 8%, Retrans and reverse comp was up a strong 44%, and content and licensing increased 7%. Entertainment operating income for the fourth quarter came in at $347 million, up 37% due to strong growth in our high-margin revenue streams. As a result, our operating income margin expanded 300 basis points. 
At our Cable Networks segment, fourth quarter revenue grew 13% to $562 million, driven by Showtime's new international licensing deal, which covers 5 countries across Europe. As we continue to do more of these deals, we are creating guaranteed revenue streams that will benefit Showtime for years to come.
In addition, we're also growing in the U.S. where our Showtime subs reached an all-time high at the end of 2015 of just under 24 million. Our fourth quarter cable operating income came in at $228 million compared with $241 million in Q4 of 2014, primarily due to the mix of titles sold and the benefit of the Bell Media deal from a year ago. As we've said consistently, margins should be looked at on a full year basis. For 2015, our margin here came in at 42%. And looking ahead to 2016, we expect our operating margins to expand at our Cable Networks segment. 
In Publishing, fourth quarter revenue of $233 million was up 8% as a result of our strong titles, demonstrating that this segment too is driven by good content. In addition, as more consumers are listening to audiobooks on their mobile devices, we are seeing strong sales in digital audio, which was up 35% during the quarter. Publishing operating income for the fourth quarter grew 36% to $34 million, and the operating income margin expanded 3 points to 15%. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect to grow our operating margin here by strong title releases, led by the Bruce Springsteen book Les just mentioned.
In Local Broadcasting, fourth quarter revenue came in at $719 million compared with $785 million in the prior period when we had the midterm elections. However, nonpolitical revenue grew 1%, which is in line with what we told you on our last call. Telecom, Food and Beverage and Entertainment were the best-performing categories during the quarter. Local Broadcasting operating income for the fourth quarter was $232 million compared with $292 million a year ago. Our Local Broadcasting margin came in at 32%, and we expect our margin to expand in 2016 as a result of the cost-saving initiatives we've been implementing as well as political advertising.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. For all of 2015, free cash flow was $1.2 billion, up from $1 billion in 2014. We ended 2015 with $323 million of cash on hand and gross debt of $8.4 billion, which yields a prudent 2.7x leverage ratio. Also for the year, we repurchased nearly 52 million shares of our stock for $2.8 billion. We have $2 billion remaining on our share buyback program, which we expect to complete in 2016. Returning value to our shareholders remains a key priority for us.
Now let me give you a few observations of what we see ahead. For advertising, the momentum that started in Q3 of 2015 continues to build here in Q1 of 2016. At the network, we expect a very strong first quarter driven by an extra NFL playoff game, Super Bowl 50 and the Grammys, as well as growth in the scatter marketplace, which continues to benefit us because of the inventory we held back from last year's upfront. Local Broadcasting will also get a lift from the Super Bowl and is pacing to be up high single digits in the first quarter. 
In content licensing, we continue to replenish the pipeline. We have lots of young series across our networks that we have not yet monetized domestically, including NCIS: New Orleans, Scorpion and Limitless from CBS, as well as Ray Donovan, The Affair and Billions from Showtime. So with so much choice out there, only the best content will stand out, and we have the content that will deliver that. 
Also, as you've heard, we expect to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp this year. Up until this point, much of our growth in this category has been driven from retrans, but reverse comp is now playing a very big role in this growth story as we make our way towards exceeding $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp by 2020.
So in summary, we just completed a very strong quarter, and we are poised for a record-setting 2016. Looking beyond that, investing in our future as a content company remains the best thing we can do for our shareholders. Our ability to offer a concentrated value proposition with the best in news, sports and entertainment is what makes CBS stand out from the rest. It's the reason we can thrive in a traditional bundled universe and why we're positioned to succeed in an unbundled, à la carte world as well. And the global opportunities are huge. So we feel very good about where we're headed, and we look forward to discussing our results with you on our next call in early May.

The reason we are so encouraged, there was concern at the last upfront that the numbers, even though CPMs were up mid-single digits, volume was down. There was a little bit of nervousness: oh, gee, is the digital revolution taking over? And as we saw, beginning in the third quarter, when scatter went up in terms of high teens we're talking about, and that continued into the fourth quarter and continuing to the first quarter. So once again, we always like to say that a guy who bought ads from CBS in October paid like nearly 20% more than he would have if he would have bought from us in July. 
As this momentum continues, and once again, tightened by the great sporting events we have, the Grammy Awards, political advertising locally, but at the network the scatter is getting better every month. So as we head into the upfront we are fairly certain, and once again, Jo Ann Ross will kill me, so I don't give numbers, but I think it's going to be substantially higher than it has been before, than it has been in the past year. And I think it generally follows that when scatter is this strong the upfront continues to be strong, and we're anticipating that now. 
In terms of development, there is really nothing uniquely different now. Obviously we have a new President of Entertainment, who has slightly different tastes than Nina, and Glenn is great. We are ordering around the same number of pilots as we have in previous years. I would say we own a lot more than we ever have before. There are only a couple that we are not -- that we don't own at least half, and an awful lot of them we own 100% of that. Because, as you see, the back end becomes as important, if not more, than the front end. And the kind of shows that we're developing once again at this point, they're across the board from procedurals that have worked very well with us to more soap-y, serialized shows, which now with the SVOD players, buying them and paying more for them. 
So it really is too early to tell. I can tell you I'm very pleased with the development. We don't need that much because we have a great stability in our #1 schedule. So I've read all the scripts, and we're casting and will start production shortly."

Obviously, again, political driving it, not to the degree as it's going to benefit local television stations, but there will certainly be a benefit in that. 
We obviously in the middle of the year last year, we changed our management team as well. So again, we're expecting margin expansion and growth. Again, it's also a very, again, low capital-intensive business. And so we do benefit a lot from significant cash flow that they generate. 
As far as the cable numbers, the sub growth there, again, as we said, ended the year at an all-time high. And so if -- the benefit of owning shows obviously is high margins, so when we sell those shows and make them available, we sell a Dexter, a lot of that profit falls in that quarter. So they will have some lumpiness on the mix of those titles of what year was it sold, was there 8 seasons, 6 seasons, 2 seasons. So I think that obviously does cause some volatility to the numbers. But again, the high class problem is how high is up. And so it is in a much better position we are in generating and take that and reinvesting it into the business to do more and more original series. So that really gives us the ability to do that. 
So we like owning it. And I know you guys would like a steady growth rate and just plug it into your model and have it go every quarter. But that's why we said look at it on a full year basis and it usually evens out."

In addition, you'd see things from programmatic and you hear noise that maybe not everybody recorded is really a person, it's a machine. And I think the validity of the content, the shows that we're putting on shows that viewers are engaged and the advertising works better. So I don't think -- it hasn't been surprising.

Or will you be handling those separately? 
And then a second unrelated question. Looking at just kind of big picture, 2015 versus '14 margins being slightly down, you highlighted that the 2 main reasons were programming costs going up and investments in digital distribution. I would assume programming costs don't necessarily go down because your per episode cost probably goes up and you probably have more stuff to sell. But I would assume digital distribution investments may go down. Correct me if I'm wrong.

You see that terminology being used more for what's valuable. And I think the advertisers and the agencies are realizing that C7 is a better way of measurement. 
In terms of digital sales and cross-platform guarantees, as each day goes by we're doing a lot more cross-selling, that our digital group is working very closely with our network group. We saw an awful lot of it in the Super Bowl. And yes, guarantees can be paid off in many ways by either one of them shifting. There are times we've used network guarantees digitally.

I'm extremely pleased to tell you that CBS has turned in a phenomenal first quarter. Revenue was up 10% to $3.85 billion, the highest we've ever had in the first quarter in our history. Operating income was up 16% to $812 million, our best OI for any quarter ever. And EPS was up 32% to a new quarterly record of $1.02, marking the first-time in the history of the CBS Corporation that quarterly EPS came in above $1. 
I think you could see why we're so excited to be with you today. 
In addition to being a quarter for the record books, we had a fantastic start to what is shaping up to be an outstanding year. And beyond that, the path to our long-term success is as clear as it's ever been. 
As most of you know, we held an Investor Day during the quarter. We showed you how we outperformed our goal over the last 5 years and we laid out a road map to generate billions of dollars in new incremental revenue over the next 5 years. Each quarter going forward will represent another step in achieving this new goal, and our earnings today are just the beginning. 
As we look at today's results, it's important to note that in addition to the new incremental revenue we outlined to you on Investor Day, advertising was also way up in Q1. Advertising grew 31% overall and 49% at the CBS Television Network. Obviously, the Super Bowl played a big part in this, but even when you take out the Super Bowl and our 3 extra NFL games, underlying network advertising was up 12%, the strongest we've seen in a long, long time. 
Clearly, there's a shift in dollars coming back to network television. Part of this is because there are questions now arising about the effectiveness of certain digital advertising platforms, and as a recent study by Standard Media Index showed, there's a direct correlation between TV advertising and sales results. 
At the same time, basic cable doesn't have the reach of network television, and most of its channels are seeing bigger and bigger declines in ratings. So marketers are realizing once again that they get their best returns with broadcast television advertising. This is a big part of why you're seeing the kind of results we're talking about today. 
In addition to advertising coming back, we're also seeing significant gains in other key growth areas as well. Retrans and reverse comp are set to surpass $1 billion this year and hit $2.5 billion in 2020. Many news skinny bundles will soon be seen. The international marketplace is exploding with new opportunities for our CBS and Showtime content and our over-the-top subscription services. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are beginning to make a meaningful contribution to our revenue and our profit. 
So our base business, our new business and our future businesses have never looked better. 
At the center of all this is our content, and that starts with our primetime lineup on the CBS Television Network. We are just 3 weeks away from the end of the 2015, 2016 season. And no surprise, CBS is, once again, a dominant #1 in viewers and household. Plus, this year, we're also #1 across the board, we're #1 in 25 to 54, and in 18 to 49. This is with or without football. And when you include it, we're even #1 in 18 to 34. If these numbers hold up here in the next couple of weeks, we'll become the first network in 14 years to be #1 across all of these demographics. You don't achieve a milestone like this without the broad-based strength and unparalleled reach that we have at CBS. 
And with the Upfront upon us, we're having this remarkable success at exactly the right time. Not only do we have the #1 schedule on television, but the scatter marketplace is as hot at it's been in many, many years. Last year, those who bought their ad time early did extremely well. Since then, scatter pricing has grown dramatically, and it's clear that clients are not going to want to miss out on the opportunity to buy their time early this year. Needless to say, we feel very good about the hand we'll be playing when negotiations begin in the coming weeks. 
With these ratings, this schedule and the ad market on fire, we are salivating as we head into the Upfront season. 
We're also extremely confident that we will have the strongest programming lineup in the marketplace. Once again, we have very few holes to fill and the bark to make it on to our primetime schedule is very high. I feel great about our existing schedule, and I look forward to unveiling our new shows at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. In addition, we stand to increase the amount of primetime programming that we own. Out of 16 pilots, we have ownership in 15 of them. Meaning, we are once again looking at owning about 80% of the scripted series on our schedule next year. 
Remember, in addition to growing advertising dollars we get from our #1 lineup, every own series we launch create a new opportunity for us to monetize our programming through multiplatform content licensing around the world. 
In sports, the return of [indiscernible] football will give us a tremendous promotional platform to launch our new fall lineup. We will have 5 strong match ups early in the season at a time when all the teams will still be in contention. Plus each of our games features a team from one of our O&O markets, which will lead to significant national and local ad revenue. 
Last month, we also announced an extension of our partnership with Turner Sports to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032. That's 16 more years. Given the terms of this deal, we can say absolutely right now that we will be profitable every single year. You don't often hear that about sports deals in these days. I look forward to personally renegotiating our next extension in 2032. 
Turning to late-night. Both of our shows continue to perform very well for us. Stephen Colbert is the only late night host to post year-to-year gains in viewers and key demos. And we just brought in executive producer of CBS This Morning, Chris Leg [ph], to help build on this success. Meanwhile, James Corden at 12:30 has become the new Internet sensation passing 1 billion views on YouTube, including the 2 most-watched clips in all of late-night. And as owners of both our late-night shows, we are monetizing all of this dealing. 
In news season to date, CBS This Morning and Face the Nation [ph] have their biggest audiences in 28 years, and the CBS News has its largest audience in 10 years. Plus 60 minutes is the #1 news program in television, and Face the Nation, 48 hours and CBS Sunday morning are all #1 in their categories. 
In addition to this momentum on air, CBS News is enjoying great success in digital as well. Revenue in viewers at CBSN are growing at an extremely fast clip, including a new high of 50 million streams in Q1. And just lastly, CBSN received the prestigious Webby Award for Best News and Info Channel from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. 
We've also expanded our digital presence with CBS All Access, our direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service. CBS All Access is the only place you can get the entire stack of current the CBS shows. And this January, we will begin streaming our first original series. All Access will be home of the first original Star Trek series in 11 years. Star Trek will debut simultaneously on both All Access and the CBS Television Network with subsequent episodes available exclusively on All Access. We have one of the best creative teams behind this show, and we are confident that its large passionate fan base will lead to substantial and profitable subscriber growth. 
Going forward, we will be adding 3 to 4 original series premier. So stand by for more updates about CBS All Access soon. 
Our new Over-The-Top streaming service, Showtime, is also driving subscriber growth and becoming a meaningful contributor to our premium cable business. This new way for consumers to sign up to Showtime has vastly expanded our potential marketplace. Cord cutters and people who used to have to buy a lot of other programming before they could get Showtime, now can get Showtime directly. Of course, it also helps that Showtime has the best year round roster of hit series and premium television. This includes HOMELAND, The Affair, Ray Donovan, Masters of Sex, and now Billions. And there's more on the way, including Rodeos [indiscernible], I'm Dying Up Here from Jim Carrey and the return of the classic, Twin Peaks. 
In addition, these hit series continue to lead to lucrative international deals. During the quarter, we announced agreements to license the entire Showtime channel to Sky in Europe and Stan [ph] in Australia, including shows that we have not even launched yet. And right now, we are in discussions about a number new similar deals that we hope to announce in the quarters to come. Equally created growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime and even better economics than we used to get by selling our shows individually. 
Turning to Publishing. Great content continues to be the backbone of our success at Simon & Schuster. We're already ahead of last year's pace with 99 books on The New York Times' Bestseller List with 6 of them having made #1. It's a great start to what is sure to be a terrific year. Thanks to the big titles we have coming out in the months ahead, including the latest from Stephen King in the summer, and the highly anticipated release of Bruce Springsteen's memoir, Born to Run, in the fall. 
In Local Broadcasting, our TV stations have an outstanding quarter. We set a record for Super Bowl sales, and we had our best Grammys ever as well. Plus, first quarter political advertising was the strongest we've seen in several election cycles. Clearly, there were a lot of fireworks yet to come, and with those fireworks will come more revenue. 
Plus there stands to be a lot more spending in local elections as many candidates look to forge their own path rather than just tuck in with the top of their ticket. In fact, we believe that when it's said and done, we will have set a new record this year for political revenue in a presidential election year. Also, in local, as we previously announced, we are working towards and separating our radio business from the CBS Corporation. While we are currently, working to split off this asset, just like we did with our outdoor business, there's also been a lot of interest from outside parties. So we have a number of different options to consider, and we will continue to keep you posted on this important initiative. 
As you can see, across our company, we turned in a great quarter heading into a great '16, heading into a great next 5 years. We're looking at the future, but at the same time, we're focusing on the here and now as well, and we're hitting on numbers out of the park. As we continue to demonstrate we have the strategy to succeed no matter how consumers choose to get their content and no matter how quickly their viewing habits change, and because we have diversified our revenue streams, we can enjoy success regardless of economic cycles. 
What's especially exciting right now is we are operating in an environment where advertising has picked up remarkably. As I said earlier, the unique value of big-ticket programming is becoming more and more apparent every single day. So the advertising set of our company is extremely strong, which is terrific news as we enter the upfront marketplace. 
And on our ever-growing nonadvertising newer revenue side of our company, we're poised for continued growth as well. Because we have must-have contents at both CBS and Showtime no matter how consumers choose to watch loss. There are 3 main ways we're looking at this going forward. First, traditional MVPDs and CBS affiliates, and these deals with these partners are leading these steady continued growth in affiliate fees, including retrans and reverse comp. Next, there's the skinny bundle. You're hearing a lot of noise about these services coming to market. As they continue to take shape, and they are taking shape, it's a huge positive for us. Again, the rate we get per sub here will be even higher than we are getting from our current partners. And finally, we are also in the very early stages of disturbing our content to our in-house over-the-top services, both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, are proving to be extremely available strategic assets in this rapidly changing distributional landscape. 
So yes, we had a phenomenal quarter with record-setting revenue and record-setting EPS. One of the best quarters we've ever had. But it's not believe the short term that makes CBS so attractive right now. It's the fact that this company is set up to succeed for many years to come. 
As always, I look forward to updating you on our progress. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."
27763231,329048744,971362,"CBS Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we kicked off 2016 with a record breaking first quarter, once again proving that when you have the big-ticket programming and premium content that audiences have to have, the results will follow. Ev",1503,"Thanks, Les. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we kicked off 2016 with a record breaking first quarter, once again proving that when you have the big-ticket programming and premium content that audiences have to have, the results will follow. Even better, we delivered our highest ever quarterly profits, while we continued to invest in new programming and in our distribution services. So as we grow in the near term, we continue to position ourselves for even more growth in the long term. 
Now let me give you some more details about our first quarter results. Revenue grew 10% to $3.85 billion. Advertising was up 31% for the quarter, as Les said, the Super Bowl led the way. However, underlying network advertising continue to accelerate from the 8% growth we saw both in Q3 and Q4 of last year, and was up 12% here in Q1. That's the highest increase we've seen in 5 years. Affiliate and subscription fees grew 15%, driven by strong increases in retrans and reverse comp, which was up 42% for the quarter. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT also contributed to the growth. And as we continue to build our subscriber basis, our over-the-top subscription services will become a bigger part of this revenue stream in the quarters to come. 
Content licensing and distribution came in at $729 million compared with $1 billion in 2015 when we had the domestic streaming sales of both NCIS and CSI as well as the international sale of our Showtime programming to Bell Media in Canada.  As you know, content sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of availabilities. But with our vast pipeline of hits and huge demand around the world for our content, we are as bullish as ever about our content licensing opportunities. 
Also during the quarter, operating income was up 16% to $812 million, an all-time high. And we achieved this growth even as we produced 10% more episodes across our networks, including the launch of our latest Showtime hit series, Billions, which is certainly an investment that will pay off in the future. 
In addition, our operating income margin expanded 100 basis points to 21%, and our digital initiatives added to this margin expansion. Net earnings were up 21% to a record $474 million in the first quarter. And our first quarter EPS came in at another all-time high of $1.02, up 32% from $0.77 last year. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue in the first quarter was up 14% to $2.6 billion. Once again, this segment posted big gains in network advertising, which increased 49%, thanks to the Super Bowl and extra playoff game and 2 additional regular-season Sunday games. But as we said, underlying network advertising was up 12% driven by strong demand in scatter marketplace. In addition, we saw healthy increases in affiliate and subscription fees, which were largely driven by retrans, with an assist from CBS All Access as well. 
Entertainment operating income for the first quarter was up 30% to $449 million, and the operating income margin grew 2 points to 17%. Cable Networks revenue came in at $525 million compared with $539 million in the first quarter of 2015 when we closed our Bell Media deal. Cable affiliate and subscription fees grew 2% during the quarter. Cable Networks operating income for the first quarter was $228 million compared with $251 million last year, primarily because of the lower international licensing revenue and our investment in original programming. The operating income margin was a solid 43%, and we expect our full year margin to expand from here. 
In Publishing, revenue of $145 million was even with last year's first quarter, and digital sales represented 28% of the total revenue. Publishing operating income for the first quarter was up 8% to $13 million, driven by operating efficiencies. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $649 million grew 9% from Q1 of 2015. TV stations were up 18% led by the Super Bowl and higher political spending. Radio stations were down 2%. During the quarter, we saw a broad strength across our top advertising categories led by auto, retail and financial services. Local Broadcasting operating income was up 28% to $206 million in the first quarter as the segment continues to benefit from the efficiency created by last year's restructuring activities and favorable contract negotiations. In addition, the Local Broadcasting operating income margin grew 5 points to 32%. 
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at a record $990 million, driven by the Super Bowl and continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our stock for $500 million. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion remaining on our current share buyback program. As we have said, we expect to complete this program by the end of the year. We continue to invest in our business first and foremost, and return excess capital to shareholders. That is a key priority for us, and it will remain a key priority for us going forward as well. 
We also ended the first quarter with a leverage ratio of under 2.6x and $411 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the Radio separation. We are in the process of completing the audit of the stand-alone financial statements of Radio, and we are now preparing a registration statement that we plan to file with the SEC in the June, July time frame. We think a stand-alone public company exit is the best option available. However, if there is a transaction that can maximize the after-tax value of this business in a shorter period of time with a higher degree of certainty, we will pursue that as well. We will keep you posted on the developments in the quarters to come. 
Now let me tell you a little bit of what we see ahead. 2016 will be a strong year for broadcast network advertising. As you've heard, there is robust scatter demand as we head into the upfront. So we feel very good about our ability to increase both pricing and volume, which will benefit us in Q4 of this year and the first 3 quarters of 2017 as well. In local, our businesses are pacing to be up low single-digits in the second quarter. And as you know, political advertising will accelerate in the back half of the year with Q4 being the strongest. In affiliate and subscription fees, we see a lot of growth opportunities across the board from traditional bundles to skinny bundles to over-the-top. First, as Les said, retrans and reverse comp are on track to surpass $1 billion this year. However, this is very much a long-term growth story with 36% of our retrans and 38% of our affiliate deals expiring over the next 3 years. This gives us the opportunity to reset these contracts to fair market value and make our ways towards achieving our $2.5 billion revenue goal in 2020. 
There's also a lot of activities surrounding new skinny bundles. As we've all read recently, existing companies and new players are looking to enter this space, and CBS will be an essential part of any successful offering. So stay tuned for more on that in the coming quarters. 
In addition, our over-the-top services are also gaining momentum. As we told you, our target is to generate $800 million in annual revenue from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT over the next 5 years. While it's still early, we are on track to meet or exceed that goal. 
In content licensing and distribution, we have a large pipeline of programming from across our networks, including more than 600 episodes that we have not yet sold into domestic syndication or streaming. As you heard, we also have ownership in 15 out of the 16 of our CBS pilots. So we continue to build our pipeline every day. With strong demand for our content both domestically and internationally, we will remain prudent in how we go about licensing our hit series so that we can continue to maximize the value of every one of our franchises. 
So in summary. We came out of the gate with a record first quarter, and we expect 2016 to continue this momentum, with political ramping in the back half of the year, continued growth in retrans and reverse comp, near-term skinny bundle opportunities, a bigger contribution from our OTT services, robust global demand for our content and a strong advertising environment. So already, year 1 of our 5-year plan that we outlined for you at our Investor Day is shaping up to be a terrific start toward the path of long-term success. So it's a good time to be a CBS investor today, and we're confident there's plenty of upside from here because of the revenue opportunities we have before us. With that, and let's open the line for questions."

Yes, we probably -- our intent will be probably to sell more inventory this year. We expect to. Last year, we sold less because the pricing wasn't as high as we wanted it to be. But once again, we gambled on scatter being better than upfront, and it proved to be a great gamble. It proved to be great play.

And then second on Showtime. Number one, you showed us a lot of good content that you have coming out this year. Can you talk a little bit about how the programming budget is growing there this year? And then also, as we think about the top line growth in the near-term, kind of over the next year, how much is coming from trying to drive subscribers to the sort of legacy model?

I'm extremely pleased to tell you that CBS has turned in a phenomenal first quarter.

I'm extremely pleased to tell you that CBS has turned in a phenomenal first quarter. Revenue was up 10% to $3.85 billion, the highest we've ever had in the first quarter in our history. Operating income was up 16% to $812 million, our best OI for any quarter ever. And EPS was up 32% to a new quarterly record of $1.02, marking the first time in the history of the CBS Corporation that quarterly EPS came in above $1. I think you could see why we're so excited to be with you today. 
In addition to being a quarter for the record books, we had a fantastic start to what is shaping up to be an outstanding year. And beyond that, the path to our long-term success is as clear as it's ever been. 
As most of you know, we held an Investor Day during the quarter. We showed you how we outperformed our goal over the last 5 years, and we laid out a road map to generate billions of dollars in new incremental revenue over the next 5 years. Each quarter going forward will represent another step in achieving this new goal, and our earnings today are just the beginning. 
As we look at today's results, it's important to note that in addition to the new incremental revenue we outlined to you on Investor Day, advertising was also way up in Q1. Advertising grew 31% overall and 49% at the CBS Television Network. Obviously, the Super Bowl played a big part in this, but even when you take out the Super Bowl and our 3 extra NFL games, underlying network advertising was up 12%, the strongest we've seen in a long, long time. 
Clearly, there's a shift in dollars coming back to network television. Part of this is because there are questions now arising about the effectiveness of certain digital advertising platforms, and as a recent study by Standard Media Index showed, there is a direct correlation between TV advertising and sales results. 
At the same time, basic cable doesn't have the reach of network television, and most of its channels are seeing bigger and bigger declines in ratings. So marketers are realizing once again that they get their best returns with broadcast television advertising. This is a big part of why you're seeing the kind of results we're talking about today. 
In addition to advertising coming back, we're also seeing significant gains in other key growth areas as well. Retrans and reverse comp are set to surpass $1 billion this year and hit $2.5 billion in 2020. Many new lucrative skinny bundles will soon be seen. The international marketplace is exploding with new opportunities for our CBS and Showtime content and our over-the-top subscription services. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are beginning to make a meaningful contribution to our revenue and our profit. So our base business, our new business and our future businesses have never looked better. 
At the center of all this is our content, and that starts with our primetime lineup on the CBS Television Network. We are just 3 weeks away from the end of the 2015, 2016 season. And no surprise, CBS is, once again, a dominant #1 in viewers and households. Plus, this year, we're also #1 across the board. We're #1 in 25 to 54 and in 18 to 49. This is with or without football. And when you include it, we're even #1 in 18 to 34. If these numbers hold up here in the next couple of weeks, we'll become the first network in 14 years to be #1 across all of these demographics. You don't achieve a milestone like this without the broad-based strength and unparalleled reach that we have at CBS. 
And with the upfront upon us, we're having this remarkable success at exactly the right time. Not only do we have the #1 schedule on television, but the scatter market is as hot at it's been in many, many years. Last year, those who bought their ad time early did extremely well. Since then, scatter pricing has grown dramatically, and it's clear that clients are not going to want to miss out on the opportunity to buy their time early this year. Needless to say, we feel very good about the hand we'll be playing when negotiations begin in the coming weeks. With these ratings, this schedule and the ad market on fire, we are salivating as we head into the upfront season. 
We're also extremely confident that we will have the strongest programming lineup in the marketplace. Once again, we have very few holes to fill, and the bar to make it on to our primetime schedule is very high. I feel great about our existing schedule, and I look forward to unveiling our new shows at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. 
In addition, we stand to increase the amount of primetime programming that we own. Out of 16 pilots, we have ownership in 15 of them. Meaning, we are once again looking at owning about 80% of the scripted series on our schedule next year. Remember, in addition to growing advertising dollars we get from our #1 lineup, every owned series we launch creates a new opportunity for us to monetize our programming through multi-platform content licensing around the world. 
In sports, the return to Thursday Night Football will give us a tremendous promotional platform to launch our new fall lineup. We will have 5 strong matchups early in the season at a time when all the teams will still be in contention. Plus, each of our games features a team from one of our O&O markets, which will lead to significant national and local ad revenue. 
Last month, we also announced an extension of our partnership with Turner Sports to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032. That's 16 more years. Given the terms of this deal, we can say absolutely right now that we will be profitable every single year. You don't often hear that about sports deals these days. I look forward to personally renegotiating our next extension in 2032. 
Turning to late night. Both of our shows continue to perform very well for us. Stephen Colbert is the only late night host to post year-to-year gains in viewers and key demos. And we just brought in executive producer of CBS This Morning, Chris Licht, to help build on our success. Meanwhile, James Corden at 12:30 has become the new Internet sensation, passing 1 billion views on YouTube, including the 2 most-watched clips in all of late night. And as owners of both our late night shows, we're monetizing all of this viewing. 
In news season to date, CBS This Morning and Face the Nation have their biggest audiences in 28 years, and the CBS Evening News has its largest audience in 10 years. Plus, 60 minutes is the #1 news programming on television, and Face the Nation, 48 hours and CBS Sunday Morning are all #1 in their categories. 
In addition to this momentum on air, CBS News is enjoying great success in digital as well. Revenue in viewers at CBSN are growing at an extremely fast clip, including a new high of 50 million streams in Q1. And just last week, CBSN received the prestigious Webby Award for Best News & Info Channel from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. 
We've also expanded our digital presence with CBS All Access, our direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service. CBS All Access is the only place you can get the entire stack of current CBS shows, and this January, we will begin streaming our first original series. All Access will be home of the first original Star Trek series in 11 years. Star Trek will debut simultaneously on both All Access and the CBS Television Network, with subsequent episodes available exclusively on All Access. We have one of the best creative teams behind this show, and we're confident that its large passionate fan base will lead to substantial and profitable subscriber growth. Going forward, we will be adding 3 to 4 original series per year. So stand by for more updates about CBS All Access soon. 
Our new over-the-top streaming service at Showtime is also driving subscriber growth and becoming a meaningful contributor to our premium cable business. This new way for consumers to sign up for Showtime has vastly expanded our potential marketplace. Cord cutters and people who used to have to buy a lot of other programming before they could get Showtime now can get Showtime directly. Of course, it also helps that Showtime has the best year-round roster of hit series and premium television. This includes Homeland, The Affair, Ray Donovan, Masters of Sex and now Billions. And there's more on the way, including ROADIES from Cameron Crowe, I'm Dying Up Here from Jim Carrey and the return of the classic, Twin Peaks. 
In addition, these hit series continue to lead to lucrative international deals. During the quarter, we announced agreements to license the entire Showtime channel to Sky in Europe and Stan in Australia, including shows that we haven't even launched yet. And right now, we're in discussions about a number of new similar deals that we hope to announce in the quarters to come. Each will create a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime and even better economics than we used to get by selling our shows individually. 
Turning to Publishing. Great content continues to be the backbone of our success at Simon & Schuster. We're already ahead of last year's pace with 99 books on The New York Times bestseller list, with 6 of them having made #1. It's a great start to what is sure to be a terrific year. Thanks to the big titles we have coming out in the months ahead, including the latest from Stephen King in the summer and the highly anticipated release of Bruce Springsteen's memoir, Born to Run, in the fall. 
In Local Broadcasting, our TV stations had an outstanding quarter. We set a record for Super Bowl sales, and we had our best GRAMMYs ever as well. Plus, first quarter political advertising was the strongest we've seen in several election cycles. Clearly, there were a lot of fireworks yet to come, and with those fireworks will come more revenue. Plus, there stands to be a lot more spending in local elections as many candidates look to forge their own path rather than just tuck in with the top of their ticket. In fact, we believe that when it's said and done, we will have set a new record this year for political revenue in a presidential election year. 
Also in Local, as we've previously announced, we are working toward separating our RADIO business from the CBS Corporation. While we are currently working to split off this asset, just like we did with our outdoor business, there's also been a lot of interest from outside parties. So we have a number of different options to consider, and we will continue to keep you posted on this important initiative. 
As you can see, across our company, we turned in a great quarter, heading into a great '16, heading into a great next 5 years. We're looking at the future, but at the same time, we're focusing on the here and now as well. And we're hitting our numbers out of the park. As we continue to demonstrate we have the strategy to succeed no matter how consumers choose to get their content and no matter how quickly their viewing habits change, and because we have diversified our revenue streams, we can enjoy success regardless of economic cycles. 
What's especially exciting right now is that we're operating in an environment where advertising has picked up remarkably. As I said earlier, the unique value of big-ticket programming is becoming more and more apparent every single day. So the advertising side of our company is extremely strong, which is a terrific news as we enter the upfront marketplace. 
And on our ever-growing, non-advertising, newer revenue side of our company, we're poised for continued growth as well because we have must-have content at both CBS and Showtime no matter how consumers choose to watch us. There are 3 main ways we are looking at this going forward. First, traditional MVPDs and CBS affiliates, and these deals with these partners are leading the steady continued growth in affiliate fees, including retrans and reverse comp. 
Next, there is the skinny bundle. You're hearing a lot of noise about these services coming to market. As they continue to take shape, and they are taking shape, it's a huge positive for us. Again, the rate we get per sub here will be even higher than we're getting from our current partners. 
And finally, we are also in the very early stages of distributing our content to our in-house over-the-top services. Both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are proving to be extremely valuable strategic assets in this rapidly changing distributional landscape. 
So yes, we had a phenomenal quarter with record-setting revenue and record-setting EPS, one of the best quarters we've ever had. But it's not only the short term that makes CBS so attractive right now. It's the fact that this company is set up to succeed for many years to come. 
As always, I look forward to updating you on our progress. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."

Now let me give you some more details about our first quarter results. Revenue grew 10% to $3.85 billion. Advertising was up 31% for the quarter, as Les said, the Super Bowl led the way. However, underlying network advertising continue to accelerate from the 8% growth we saw both in Q3 and Q4 of last year and was up 12% here in Q1. That's the highest increase we've seen in 5 years. 
Affiliate and subscription fees grew 15%, driven by strong increases in retrans and reverse comp, which was up 42% for the quarter. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT also contributed to the growth. And as we continue to build our subscriber bases, our over-the-top subscription services will become a bigger part of this revenue stream in the quarters to come. 
Content licensing and distribution came in at $729 million compared with $1 billion in 2015 when we had the domestic streaming sales of both NCIS and CSI as well as the international sale of our Showtime programming to Bell Media in Canada. As you know, content sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of availabilities. But with our vast pipeline of hits and huge demand around the world for our content, we are as bullish as ever about our content licensing opportunities. 
Also during the quarter, operating income was up 16% to $812 million, an all-time high. And we achieved this growth even as we produced 10% more episodes across our networks, including the launch of our latest Showtime hit series, Billions, which is certainly an investment that will pay off in the future. In addition, our operating income margin expanded 100 basis points to 21%, and our digital initiatives added to this margin expansion. 
Net earnings were up 21% to a record $474 million in the first quarter. And our first quarter EPS came in at another all-time high of $1.02, up 32% from $0.77 last year. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue in the first quarter was up 14% to $2.6 billion. Once again, this segment posted big gains in network advertising, which increased 49%, thanks to the Super Bowl and extra playoff game and 2 additional regular season Sunday games. But as we said, underlying network advertising was up 12%, driven by strong demand in the scatter marketplace. In addition, we saw healthy increases in affiliate and subscription fees, which were largely driven by retrans, with an assist from CBS All Access as well. Entertainment operating income for the first quarter was up 30% to $449 million, and the operating income margin grew 2 points to 17%. 
Cable Networks revenue came in at $525 million compared with $539 million in the first quarter of 2015 when we closed our Bell Media deal. Cable affiliate and subscription fees grew 2% during the quarter. Cable Networks operating income for the first quarter was $228 million compared with $251 million last year, primarily because of the lower international licensing revenue and our investment in original programming. The operating income margin was a solid 43%, and we expect our full year margin to expand from here. 
In Publishing, revenue of $145 million was even with last year's first quarter, and digital sales represented 28% of the total revenue. Publishing operating income for the first quarter was up 8% to $13 million, driven by operating efficiencies. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $649 million grew 9% from Q1 of 2015. TV stations were up 18%, led by the Super Bowl and higher political spending. Radio stations were down 2%. During the quarter, we saw a broad strength across our top advertising categories, led by auto, retail and financial services. Local Broadcasting operating income was up 28% to $206 million in the first quarter as the segment continues to benefit from the efficiencies created by last year's restructuring activities and favorable contract negotiations. In addition, the Local Broadcasting operating income margin grew 5 points to 32%. 
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at a record $990 million, driven by the Super Bowl and continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our stock for $500 million. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion remaining on our current share buyback program. As we have said, we expect to complete this program by the end of the year. We continue to invest in our business first and foremost and return excess capital to shareholders. That is a key priority for us, and it will remain a key priority for us going forward as well. We also ended the first quarter with a leverage ratio of under 2.6x and $411 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the RADIO separation. We are in the process of completing the audit of the stand-alone financial statements of RADIO, and we are now preparing a registration statement that we plan to file with the SEC in the June, July time frame. We think a stand-alone public company exit is the best option available. However, if there is a transaction that can maximize the after-tax value of this business in a shorter period of time with a higher degree of certainty, we will pursue that as well. We will keep you posted on the developments in the quarters to come. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. 2016 will be a strong year for broadcast network advertising. As you heard, there is robust scatter demand as we head into the upfront. So we feel very good about our ability to increase both pricing and volume, which will benefit us in Q4 of this year and the first 3 quarters of 2017 as well. 
In local, our businesses are pacing to be up low single digits in the second quarter. And as you know, political advertising will accelerate in the back half of the year, with Q4 being the strongest. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we see a lot of growth opportunities across the board, from traditional bundles to skinny bundles to over-the-top. First, as Les said, retrans and reverse comp are on track to surpass $1 billion this year. However, this is very much a long-term growth story, with 36% of our retrans and 38% of our affiliate deals expiring over the next 3 years. This gives us the opportunity to reset these contracts to fair market value and make our ways towards achieving our $2.5 billion revenue goal in 2020. 
There's also a lot of activities surrounding new skinny bundles. As we've all read recently, existing companies and new players are looking to enter this space, and CBS will be an essential part of any successful offering. So stay tuned for more on that in the coming quarters. 
In addition, our over-the-top services are also gaining momentum. As we told you, our target is to generate $800 million in annual revenue from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT over the next 5 years. While it's still early, we are on track to meet or exceed that goal. 
In content licensing and distribution, we have a large pipeline of programming from across our networks, including more than 600 episodes that we have not yet sold into domestic syndication or streaming. As you heard, we also have ownership in 15 out of the 16 of our CBS pilots. So we continue to build our pipeline every day. With strong demand for our content both domestically and internationally, we will remain prudent in how we go about licensing our hit series so that we can continue to maximize the value of every one of our franchises. 
So in summary. We came out of the gate with a record first quarter, and we expect 2016 to continue this momentum, with political ramping in the back half of the year, continued growth in retrans and reverse comp, near-term skinny bundle opportunities, a bigger contribution from our OTT services, robust global demand for our content and a strong advertising environment. So already, year 1 of our 5-year plan that we outlined for you at our Investor Day is shaping up to be a terrific start toward the path of long-term success. So it's a good time to be a CBS investor today, and we're confident there's plenty of upside from here because of the revenue opportunities we have before us. 
With that, Anne, let's open the line for questions."

Yes, our -- we probably -- our intent will be probably to sell more inventory this year. We expect to. Last year, we sold less because the pricing wasn't as high as we wanted it to be. And once again, we gambled on scatter being better than the upfront, and it proved to be a great gamble. It proved to be a great play. This year, I think advertisers are coming in knowing that we have a stronger hand to play, that advertising for broadcast is going to be very, very strong. So I would expect the volume to be up as well as the CPMs to be up a very nice amount."

It is for us. It is for many companies in the future. Obviously, there were some kinks in the system where people were paying for a lot of fraudulent numbers of people who weren't really watching. So I think data becomes very, very important and more accurate data. In addition, what makes us confident is, by the same token digital becomes important and stays important, there is a better effect of watching a television show. There's more engagement in that. And the effectiveness of advertising of broadcast television is far superior to that, and it's been proven that digital sales that go along with broadcast sales are, by far, the most effective. So by no means are we denigrating digital sales, and we're a major part of it. But I think the bang for the buck is much higher on broadcast."

I'm extremely pleased to tell you that CBS has turned in a phenomenal first quarter. Revenue was up 10% to $3.85 billion, the highest we've ever had in the first quarter in our history. Operating income was up 16% to $812 million, our best OI for any quarter ever. And EPS was up 32% to a new quarterly record of $1.02, marking the first time in the history of the CBS Corporation that quarterly EPS came in above $1. I think you could see why we're so excited to be with you today. 
In addition to being a quarter for the record books, we had a fantastic start to what is shaping up to be an outstanding year. And beyond that, the path to our long-term success is as clear as it's ever been. 
As most of you know, we held an Investor Day during the quarter. We showed you how we outperformed our goal over the last 5 years, and we laid out a road map to generate billions of dollars in new incremental revenue over the next 5 years. Each quarter going forward will represent another step in achieving this new goal, and our earnings today are just the beginning. 
As we look at today's results, it's important to note that in addition to the new incremental revenue we outlined to you on Investor Day, advertising was also way up in Q1. Advertising grew 31% overall and 49% at the CBS Television Network. Obviously, the Super Bowl played a big part in this, but even when you take out the Super Bowl and our 3 extra NFL games, underlying network advertising was up 12%, the strongest we've seen in a long, long time. 
Clearly, there's a shift in dollars coming back to network television. Part of this is because there are questions now arising about the effectiveness of certain digital advertising platforms, and as a recent study by Standard Media Index showed, there is a direct correlation between TV advertising and sales results. 
At the same time, basic cable doesn't have the reach of network television, and most of its channels are seeing bigger and bigger declines in ratings. So marketers are realizing once again that they get their best returns with broadcast television advertising. This is a big part of why you're seeing the kind of results we're talking about today. 
In addition to advertising coming back, we're also seeing significant gains in other key growth areas as well. Retrans and reverse comp are set to surpass $1 billion this year and hit $2.5 billion in 2020. Many new lucrative skinny bundles will soon be seen. The international marketplace is exploding with new opportunities for our CBS and Showtime content and our over-the-top subscription services. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are beginning to make a meaningful contribution to our revenue and our profit. So our base business, our new business and our future businesses have never looked better. 
At the center of all this is our content, and that starts with our primetime lineup on the CBS Television Network. We are just 3 weeks away from the end of the 2015, 2016 season. And no surprise, CBS is, once again, a dominant #1 in viewers and households. Plus, this year, we're also #1 across the board. We're #1 in 25 to 54 and in 18 to 49. This is with or without football. And when you include it, we're even #1 in 18 to 34. If these numbers hold up here in the next couple of weeks, we'll become the first network in 14 years to be #1 across all of these demographics. You don't achieve a milestone like this without the broad-based strength and unparalleled reach that we have at CBS. 
And with the upfront upon us, we're having this remarkable success at exactly the right time. Not only do we have the #1 schedule on television, but the scatter market is as hot at it's been in many, many years. Last year, those who bought their ad time early did extremely well. Since then, scatter pricing has grown dramatically, and it's clear that clients are not going to want to miss out on the opportunity to buy their time early this year. Needless to say, we feel very good about the hand we'll be playing when negotiations begin in the coming weeks. With these ratings, this schedule and the ad market on fire, we are salivating as we head into the upfront season. 
We're also extremely confident that we will have the strongest programming lineup in the marketplace. Once again, we have very few holes to fill, and the bar to make it on to our primetime schedule is very high. I feel great about our existing schedule, and I look forward to unveiling our new shows at Carnegie Hall in a couple of weeks. 
In addition, we stand to increase the amount of primetime programming that we own. Out of 16 pilots, we have ownership in 15 of them. Meaning, we are once again looking at owning about 80% of the scripted series on our schedule next year. Remember, in addition to growing advertising dollars we get from our #1 lineup, every owned series we launch creates a new opportunity for us to monetize our programming through multi-platform content licensing around the world. 
In sports, the return of Thursday Night Football will give us a tremendous promotional platform to launch our new fall lineup. We will have 5 strong matchups early in the season at a time when all the teams will still be in contention. Plus, each of our games features a team from one of our O&O markets, which will lead to significant national and local ad revenue. 
Last month, we also announced an extension of our partnership with Turner Sports to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032. That's 16 more years. Given the terms of this deal, we can say absolutely right now that we will be profitable every single year. You don't often hear that about sports deals these days. I look forward to personally renegotiating our next extension in 2032. 
Turning to late night. Both of our shows continue to perform very well for us. Stephen Colbert is the only late night host to post year-to-year gains in viewers and key demos. And we just brought in executive producer of CBS This Morning, Chris Licht, to help build on our success. Meanwhile, James Corden at 12:30 has become the new Internet sensation, passing 1 billion views on YouTube, including the 2 most-watched clips in all of late night. And as owners of both our late night shows, we're monetizing all of this viewing. 
In news season to date, CBS This Morning and Face the Nation have their biggest audiences in 28 years, and the CBS Evening News has its largest audience in 10 years. Plus, 60 Minutes is the #1 news programming on television, and Face the Nation, 48 hours and CBS Sunday Morning are all #1 in their categories. 
In addition to this momentum on air, CBS News is enjoying great success in digital as well. Revenue in viewers at CBSN are growing at an extremely fast clip, including a new high of 50 million streams in Q1. And just last week, CBSN received the prestigious Webby Award for Best News & Info Channel from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. 
We've also expanded our digital presence with CBS All Access, our direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service. CBS All Access is the only place you can get the entire stack of current CBS shows, and this January, we will begin streaming our first original series. All Access will be home of the first original Star Trek series in 11 years. Star Trek will debut simultaneously on both All Access and the CBS Television Network, with subsequent episodes available exclusively on All Access. We have one of the best creative teams behind this show, and we're confident that its large, passionate fan base will lead to substantial and profitable subscriber growth. Going forward, we will be adding 3 to 4 original series per year. So stand by for more updates about CBS All Access soon. 
Our new over-the-top streaming service at Showtime is also driving subscriber growth and becoming a meaningful contributor to our premium cable business. This new way for consumers to sign up for Showtime has vastly expanded our potential marketplace. Cord cutters and people who used to have to buy a lot of other programming before they could get Showtime now can get Showtime directly. Of course, it also helps that Showtime has the best year-round roster of hit series and premium television. This includes Homeland, The Affair, Ray Donovan, Masters of Sex and now Billions. And there's more on the way, including ROADIES from Cameron Crowe, I'm Dying Up Here from Jim Carrey and the return of the classic, Twin Peaks. 
In addition, these hit series continue to lead to lucrative international deals. During the quarter, we announced agreements to license the entire Showtime channel to Sky in Europe and Stan in Australia, including shows that we haven't even launched yet. And right now, we're in discussions about a number of new similar deals that we hope to announce in the quarters to come. Each will create a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime and even better economics than we used to get by selling our shows individually. 
Turning to Publishing. Great content continues to be the backbone of our success at Simon & Schuster. We're already ahead of last year's pace with 99 books on The New York Times bestseller list, with 6 of them having made #1. It's a great start to what is sure to be a terrific year. Thanks to the big titles we have coming out in the months ahead, including the latest from Stephen King in the summer and the highly anticipated release of Bruce Springsteen's memoir, Born to Run, in the fall. 
In Local Broadcasting, our TV stations had an outstanding quarter. We set a record for Super Bowl sales, and we had our best GRAMMYs ever as well. Plus, first quarter political advertising was the strongest we've seen in several election cycles. Clearly, there are a lot of fireworks yet to come, and with those fireworks will come more revenue. Plus, there stands to be a lot more spending in local elections as many candidates look to forge their own path rather than just tuck in with the top of their ticket. In fact, we believe that when it's said and done, we will have set a new record this year for political revenue in a presidential election year. 
Also in Local, as we've previously announced, we are working toward separating our RADIO business from the CBS Corporation. While we are currently working to split off this asset, just like we did with our outdoor business, there's also been a lot of interest from outside parties. So we have a number of different options to consider, and we will continue to keep you posted on this important initiative. 
As you can see, across our company, we turned in a great quarter, heading into a great '16, heading into a great next 5 years. We're looking at the future, but at the same time, we're focusing on the here and now as well. And we're hitting our numbers out of the park. As we continue to demonstrate, we have the strategy to succeed no matter how consumers choose to get their content and no matter how quickly their viewing habits change, and because we have diversified our revenue streams, we can enjoy success regardless of economic cycles. 
What's especially exciting right now is that we're operating in an environment where advertising has picked up remarkably. As I said earlier, the unique value of big-ticket programming is becoming more and more apparent every single day. So the advertising side of our company is extremely strong, which is terrific news as we enter the upfront marketplace. 
And on our ever-growing, non-advertising, newer revenue side of our company, we're poised for continued growth as well because we have must-have content at both CBS and Showtime no matter how consumers choose to watch us. There are 3 main ways we are looking at this going forward. First, traditional MVPDs and CBS affiliates, and these deals with these partners are leading the steady continued growth in affiliate fees, including retrans and reverse comp. 
Next, there is the skinny bundle. You're hearing a lot of noise about these services coming to market. As they continue to take shape, and they are taking shape, it's a huge positive for us. Again, the rate we get per sub here will be even higher than we're getting from our current partners. 
And finally, we are also in the very early stages of distributing our content to our in-house over-the-top services. Both CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are proving to be extremely valuable strategic assets in this rapidly changing distributional landscape. 
So yes, we had a phenomenal quarter with record-setting revenue and record-setting EPS, one of the best quarters we've ever had. But it's not only the short term that makes CBS so attractive right now. It's the fact that this company is set up to succeed for many years to come. 
As always, I look forward to updating you on our progress. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."

As you heard, we kicked off 2016 with a record breaking first quarter, once again, proving that when you have the big-ticket programming and premium content that audiences have to have, the results will follow. E",1507,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we kicked off 2016 with a record breaking first quarter, once again, proving that when you have the big-ticket programming and premium content that audiences have to have, the results will follow. Even better, we delivered our highest ever quarterly profits while we continued to invest in new programming and in our distribution services. So as we grow in the near term, we continue to position ourselves for even more growth in the long term. 
Now let me give you some more details about our first quarter results. Revenue grew 10% to $3.85 billion. Advertising was up 31% for the quarter. As Les said, the Super Bowl led the way. However, underlying network advertising continued to accelerate from the 8% growth we saw both in Q3 and Q4 of last year and was up 12% here in Q1. That's the highest increase we've seen in 5 years. 
Affiliate and subscription fees grew 15%, driven by strong increases in retrans and reverse comp, which was up 42% for the quarter. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT also contributed to the growth. And as we continue to build our subscriber bases, our over-the-top subscription services will become a bigger part of this revenue stream in the quarters to come. 
Content licensing and distribution came in at $729 million compared with $1 billion in 2015 when we had the domestic streaming sales of both NCIS and CSI as well as the international sale of our Showtime programming to Bell Media in Canada. As you know, content sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of availabilities. But with our vast pipeline of hits and huge demand around the world for our content, we are as bullish as ever about our content licensing opportunities. 
Also during the quarter, operating income was up 16% to $812 million, an all-time high. And we achieved this growth even as we produced 10% more episodes across our networks, including the launch of our latest Showtime hit series, Billions, which is certainly an investment that will pay off in the future. In addition, our operating income margin expanded 100 basis points to 21%, and our digital initiatives added to this margin expansion. 
Net earnings were up 21% to a record $474 million in the first quarter. And our first quarter EPS came in at another all-time high of $1.02, up 32% from $0.77 last year. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue in the first quarter was up 14% to $2.6 billion. Once again, this segment posted big gains in network advertising, which increased 49%, thanks to the Super Bowl and extra playoff game and 2 additional regular season Sunday games. But as we said, underlying network advertising was up 12%, driven by strong demand in the scatter marketplace. In addition, we saw healthy increases in affiliate and subscription fees, which were largely driven by retrans, with an assist from CBS All Access as well. Entertainment operating income for the first quarter was up 30% to $449 million, and the operating income margin grew 2 points to 17%. 
Cable Networks revenue came in at $525 million compared with $539 million in the first quarter of 2015 when we closed our Bell Media deal. Cable affiliate and subscription fees grew 2% during the quarter. Cable Networks operating income for the first quarter was $228 million compared with $251 million last year, primarily because of the lower international licensing revenue and our investment in original programming. The operating income margin was a solid 43%, and we expect our full year margin to expand from here. 
In Publishing, revenue of $145 million was even with last year's first quarter, and digital sales represented 28% of the total revenue. Publishing operating income for the first quarter was up 8% to $13 million, driven by operating efficiencies. 
Local Broadcasting revenue of $649 million grew 9% from Q1 of 2015. TV stations were up 18%, led by the Super Bowl and higher political spending. Radio stations were down 2%. During the quarter, we saw a broad strength across our top advertising categories, led by auto, retail and financial services. Local Broadcasting operating income was up 28% to $206 million in the first quarter as the segment continues to benefit from the efficiencies created by last year's restructuring activities and favorable contract negotiations. In addition, the Local Broadcasting operating income margin grew 5 points to 32%. 
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at a record $990 million, driven by the Super Bowl and continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our stock for $500 million. At March 31, we had $1.5 billion remaining on our current share buyback program. As we have said, we expect to complete this program by the end of the year. We continue to invest in our business first and foremost and return excess capital to shareholders. That is a key priority for us, and it will remain a key priority for us going forward as well. We also ended the first quarter with a leverage ratio of under 2.6x and $411 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the RADIO separation. We are in the process of completing the audit of the stand-alone financial statements of RADIO, and we are now preparing a registration statement that we plan to file with the SEC in the June to July time frame. We think a stand-alone public company exit is the best option available. However, if there is a transaction that can maximize the after-tax value of this business in a shorter period of time with a higher degree of certainty, we will pursue that as well. We will keep you posted on the developments in the quarters to come. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. 2016 will be a strong year for broadcast network advertising. As you heard, there is robust scatter demand as we head into the upfront. So we feel very good about our ability to increase both pricing and volume, which will benefit us in Q4 of this year and the first 3 quarters of 2017 as well. 
In local, our businesses are pacing to be up low single digits in the second quarter. And as you know, political advertising will accelerate in the back half of the year, with Q4 being the strongest. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we see a lot of growth opportunities across the board, from traditional bundles to skinny bundles to over-the-top. First, as Les said, retrans and reverse comp are on track to surpass $1 billion this year. However, this is very much a long-term growth story, with 36% of our retrans and 38% of our affiliate deals expiring over the next 3 years. This gives us the opportunity to reset these contracts to fair market value and make our ways towards achieving our $2.5 billion revenue goal in 2020. 
There's also a lot of activities surrounding new skinny bundles. As we've all read recently, existing companies and new players are looking to enter this space, and CBS will be an essential part of any successful offering. So stay tuned for more on that in the coming quarters. 
In addition, our over-the-top services are also gaining momentum. As we told you, our target is to generate $800 million in annual revenue from CBS All Access and Showtime OTT over the next 5 years. While it's still early, we are on track to meet or exceed that goal. 
In content licensing and distribution, we have a large pipeline of programming from across our networks, including more than 600 episodes that we have not yet sold into domestic syndication or streaming. As you heard, we also have ownership in 15 out of the 16 of our CBS pilots. So we continue to build our pipeline every day. With strong demand for our content both domestically and internationally, we will remain prudent in how we go about licensing our hit series so that we can continue to maximize the value of every one of our franchises. 
So in summary. We came out of the gate with a record first quarter, and we expect 2016 to continue this momentum, with political ramping in the back half of the year, continued growth in retrans and reverse comp, near-term skinny bundle opportunities, a bigger contribution from our OTT services, robust global demand for our content and a strong advertising environment. So already, year 1 of our 5-year plan that we outlined for you at our Investor Day is shaping up to be a terrific start toward the path of long-term success. So it's a good time to be a CBS investor today, and we're confident there's plenty of upside from here because of the revenue opportunities we have before us.

Really, we're getting into the upfront time, and it couldn't be happening at a better time. As you heard, our ratings are doing really well. Our shows are maintaining where they were. It's going to be a very tough process because we've seen a lot of pilots and there's going to be a lot of battles in New York and L.A. over which shows get on. Yes, our -- we probably -- our intent will be probably to sell more inventory this year. We expect to. Last year, we sold less because the pricing wasn't as high as we wanted it to be. And once again, we gambled on scatter being better than the upfront, and it proved to be a great gamble. It proved to be a great play. This year, I think advertisers are coming in knowing that we have a stronger hand to play, that advertising for broadcast is going to be very, very strong. So I would expect the volume to be up as well as the CPMs to be up a very nice amount."

As you've seen in our earnings announcement, CBS turned in another outstanding quarter. Revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago and considerably better than that on an underlying basis. Operating income was up 14% to $733 million and EPS was up 26% to $0.93, the highest EPS we've ever had for  second's quarter and our 26th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Clearly, CBS continues to fire on all cylinders, and we have a number a catalyst for future growth that we're confident we'll drive earnings in the quarters and years to come. 
Just in the last few months, we have made significant strides to achieve the long-term financial goals we laid out at our Investor Day in March, and we've also taken a number of additional steps to set us up for even more success. 
Let me just touch on a few of them. One, we let the upfront marketplace with double-digit pricing increases and healthy gains in volume. 
Next, our CBS All Access and Showtime OTT streaming services have surpassed 2 million subscribers, about evenly split and well ahead of where we thought we'd be this early in the game. 
We've licensed our Star Trek franchise in the international marketplace, guaranteeing our new series will be profitable even before it launches and begins driving sub-tier in the U.S. and on CBS All Access. 
We greatly expanded our SVOD revenue for the CW, ensuring its profitability for years to come. We've just licensed our Carpool Karaoke series to Apple. This represents a significant new buyer in the SVOD marketplace. 
We filed an S-1 to move ahead with our strategy to split off our radio business through an IPO or other alternatives. And we issued $700 million of debt with the best rate in the history of our company and one of the best rates ever in our industry. 
In addition to all of this, we announced this morning that we'll be raising our dividend by 20% and we've expanded our share buyback programs to a new authorization totaling $6 billion. 
Returning cash to shareholders in a prudent manner remains a priority for us. We first invest in our business and then returned the excess cash, something we have consistently done year in and year out. 
At the same time, we are laser-focused on investing in our core competency, which is creating and distributing premium content across platforms all around the world. 
As our second quarter demonstrates, we continue to have tremendous success in this regard, and there is lots more to come. 
It all starts with the CBS Television Network where we are looking forward to launching our new primetime lineup this fall. We have an enviable mix of strong freshman series, growing young franchises and established hits. 
Very importantly, we will own more than 80% of our schedule, including ownership in every single one of our 6 new series. Each show represents another opportunity to license our content for many, many years. 
Plus these shows will have the best chance of success by virtue of launching with the promotional power of the #1 network in the world as well as Thursday Night Football. 
When it comes to recognizing the strength and stability of our primetime schedule, the advertisers has spoken. We just concluded the strongest upfront we've seen in many years. As was widely reported, significant dollars flowed back to broadcast television. Marketers realized what we've been saying for a long time that digital buys are more powerful when they complement television buys, not when they replace them. So broadcast TV had a banner upfront and CBS was at the front of the pack. 
Not only did we lead the market in pricing with double-digit increases, but we saw a very healthy gains in volume as well. We also had an extremely strong upfront across all the day parts. 
In late-night, pricing increases were even more than primetime. As we've seen during the conventions, Stephen Colbert continues to gain attention for his wit and political commentary. And in 12/30, James Corden has become a phenomenon. He hosted the highest rated Tony award in 15 years and his show just received 4 Emmy nominations. 
In addition, we are now licensing both of our late-night shows internationally for substantial revenue. Once again, our new ownership position in both of these franchises is allowing us to monetize these shows in ways we never could before. Late-night television has now become considerably more profitable with Colbert and Cordon. 
We also continue to solidify our future in big event television. Last month, we announced that the GRAMMYs will remain on CBS through 2026. When you have this extension to our current field, it means we will have the GRAMMYs for 54 consecutive years, the longest continuous partnership between an award show and a broadcaster in television history. 
Taken together with our agreement to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032, we have locked up big event programming for a long, long time. 
At CBS News, we continue to see growth in all of our key broadcast, leading to a very strong upfront in this day part as well. CBS evening news has added 1.5 million viewers since Scott Kelly became an anchor 5 years ago, that's double the growth of ABC and NBC combined and CBS This Morning have been growing its viewers month after month and during the quarter, had its highest numbers in nearly 3 decades. 
And our weekend news broadcast, 48 hours CBS Sunday Morning, Face the Nation and 60 Minutes continue to be #1 in their respective categories. 
The quality of these shows was demonstrated last week when CBS News was nominated for 37 Emmy awards more than any other news organization or cable network. 
In addition, we are also growing CBS In, our online news network. Big breaking news events in our political coverage are driving viewership, including another month of record views in June and new record high of more than 7 million streams just last week during the Republican convention. 
We've also recently broadened the reach of CBS In with the new Apple TV partnership and a deal with Twitter to stream the Republican and Democratic conventions. 
So from news, to sports, to entertainment, our base advertising business remains strong, and it's important to note that in addition to higher up front pricing, we see continued strength in advertising right through the second half of the year. 
At the same time, our non-advertising revenues, which are all the ways we monetize our programming through retrans and reverse comp, international syndication, SVOD and over the top continue to drive our results as well. One of the areas this is especially true is at the CW, where as I mentioned, we announced a new multi-year licensing agreement with Netflix that allows for full season streaming of every show 8 days after its current season finale. 
This deal allows us to maximize the value of our content, while also building for our broadcast affiliates, the CW.com, our MVPD partners and potential OTT partners as well. 
We also struck a significant international deal with Netflix through Star Trek, licensing our new series, Star Trek Discovery, to 188 Netflix countries around the world virtually everywhere but North America. 
In addition, we also licensed all 727 previous episodes of our Star Trek library. 
Plus we struck a similar deal with Bell Media for Canada. As a result, Star Trek Discovery, our new series, is profitable, and we haven't even begun production. And we still have additional windows to sell the show in second and third cycles down the road. 
It's also safe to say that Star Trek will lead through a significant bump in subscribers CBS All Access here in the U.S. 
And in addition to Star Trek, we have the upcoming Goodlife spin-off coming to All Access, along with other original programming that we will be announcing soon. 
So we're just getting started, and we're already well on our way. We're also very pleased with the progress of our Showtime Over The Top streaming product as well. 
As you recall, we set a goal of 8 million subscribers between All Access and Showtime OTT by 2020, representing $800 million in new revenue. With more than 2 million subs between them already, we're confident that this will be easily achieved. 
One of the ways we're growing our Showtime subs is by staggering the launch date of our original series. The season 4 premiere of Ray Donovan led to a significant lift in streaming subscribers here in July and looking ahead, we will have Shameless, The Affair and Homeland, all premiering in different months between now and January. 
And of course, we have the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks coming in early 2017 as well. David Lynch and Mark Frost, the creators of this franchise, have just finished shooting the new series, which includes many actors from the original cast and some terrific guest stars. 
Like Star Trek, Twin Peaks has an extremely loyal an avid fan base. So we could expect to see another surge in subs to Showtime OTT when this show premieres next year. 
Turning to Publishing. We have 2 big titles coming up that will drive our second half. Born to Run, the highly anticipated memoir by Bruce Springsteen. And the latest from comedienne, Amy Schumer, called, The Girl with a Lower Back Tattoo. 
In addition, Simon & Schuster continues to generate content that spawns new projects across our company. The latest is a movie from CBS films that is based on American assassin from the best-selling series of action thrillers by Vince Flynn. It stars Michael Keaton and will begin filming next month. 
At our TV stations, we are still in the early stages of what we are very confident will be a record presidential election year. Second quarter political sales came in higher than expected, thanks in part to primary spending in California. And right now, we're seeing big activity in many of our major market O&Os. 
As always, spending will peak in the fourth quarter, not only at the top of the ticket, but as the gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional races as well, where tickets are not quite as unified as they've been in past elections. 
In radio, we have taken a major step forward in terms of separating this business from CBS with the filing of our S-1. We are also continuing to talk about other potential alternatives. Just like we did with outdoor, our strategy is to maximize the value of this asset, while centering our company around the premium content that can best drive our results. 
So across our company, we're executing the strategy that we have laid out for our investors, and we are building on that strategy all the time. As we look ahead, every single opportunity that we evaluate has to fit the same criteria. Does it benefit CBS shareholders? From the investment of capital to the return of capital, to any potential M&A, CBS shareholders are always our priority. The good news is that we have already have the assets and the strategy to deliver on all of our financial objectives. The even better news is that there are new catalyst for growth being hatched all the time. 
The ways we can marry together our premium content with new technologies are growing every day, and we will continue to take advantage of every one of them. 
So it was a terrific quarter. Our business is thriving, and we see growth opportunities ahead that are more exciting than ever. As those opportunities unfolds, we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have laid out for you just as we always do. We are already looking forward to updating you on our next call. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
27763231,339233060,1016159,"CBS Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that, once again, reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in only more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing",1585,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that, once again, reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in only more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing our recurring revenue from places like retrans and reverse comp, SVOD, international content licensing and our over-the-top subscription services. 
As a result, we delivered healthy double-digit growth in our key profit measures even as we continue to invest in our future success. 
On the top line, we had a very strong quarter as well. Total revenue was up 2% at $3.3 billion. Although that doesn't tell the entire story. During the second quarter, we were comping against 2 significant events from last year. First, we had the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, which was the highest grossing sporting event of all time; and second, last year, we had the NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship game on CBS, which, as you know, was placed to us every other year. 
Taken together, these 2 events would have added 6 percentage points of growth to us in the second quarter. So therefore, underlying revenue was extremely healthy for the quarter. 
Now let me give you some more details about our second quarter results. As I just mentioned, we had the NCAA Men's Championship Game last year. As a result, advertising revenue for the second quarter came in at $1.55 billion compared with $1.59 billion in 2015. However, underlying network advertising grew 2% during this year second quarter. And as you heard, we recently concluded our upfront with strong pricing across all day parts. 
Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was $733 million to the quarter compared with $752 million last year. However, excluding the Mayweather fight, underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenue grew 18%. 
Retrans and reverse comp was up 44% and Showtime affiliate fees were up a solid 5%. 
As you heard, our over-the-top subscription services are also contributing to our growth and continue to track nicely above our expectations. 
Content licensing was up 16% during the second quarter, and we saw strength both domestically and internationally. 
As an example, the ways we are monetizing Star Trek demonstrate just how we can benefit from a single content franchise again and again. So the opportunities presented by owning premium content continue to be robust. 
Growth in our high-margin revenue streams led to a 14% increase in operating income, which came in at $733 million during the second quarter.  And our operating income margin expanded by more than 200 basis points to 22%. 
In addition, net earnings were up 16% to $423 million for the second quarter and EPS was up 26% to $0.93. 
Our results on a year-to-date basis were equally impressive. Revenue of $7.1 billion was up 6%, operating income of $1.5 billion was up 15% and EPS of $1.95 was up 29%. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue in the second quarter came in at $1.95 billion, up 9% with strength across the board. 
As I mentioned, underlying network advertising grew 2%. Content licensing and distribution was up 19%, thanks in part of our Star Trek deals and affiliate and subscription fees were up 59%, driven by higher retrans and reverse comp as well as growth at CBS All Access. 
Entertainment operating income of $351 million for the second quarter was up 34% due to the strong gains in our high-margin revenue streams and our entertainment operating income margin expanded 3 points to 18%. 
At our Cable Network segment, second quarter revenue came in at $536 million, down 13% from last year when we had the big pay-per-view fight, which affected the revenue comparison by 24 points. 
Underlying cable network revenue grew 11%, primarily due to the licensing of our Showtime brand and original series as well as higher affiliate and subscription fees. 
Second quarter cable operating income of $227 million was up 3%, thanks to increases in our higher-margin revenue streams, which drove operating income growth even as they continue to invest in original programming. And our cable operating income margin expanded 6 points to 42%, and we expect further margin expansion from here as we move into the back half of 2016. 
Turning to Publishing. Second quarter revenue came in at $187 million compared with $199 million last year due to the timing of releases. Best-selling titles for the second quarter included End of Watch by Stephen King and Foreign Agent by Brad Thor. And Les just mentioned, we have a strong release schedule ahead. 
Publishing operating income for the second quarter of $26 million was up 4% as a result of lower cost.  And our publishing operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points to 14%. 
In Local Broadcasting, second quarter revenue came in at $647 million compared with $654 million in 2015 with the decline entirely driven by comping against last year's NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game. 
Underlying Local Broadcasting revenue was even with 2015 with TV stations up 1% and radio stations down 1%. 
Looking ahead, we expect political spending to kick in fully during the back half of 2016 with Q4 being the strongest. 
Local Broadcasting operating income for the second quarter was up 7% to $212 million, driven by the restructuring activity we put in place last year. 
Those actions also resulted in our operating income margin expanding 3 points to a solid 33%. 
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion compared with $835 million in 2015, up 41% due to the growth in underlying advertising revenue, higher affiliate and subscription fees and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. 
Also during the first half of 2015, we bought back 19.5 million shares of our stock for $1 billion.  As we stated in the past, we expect to complete another $1 billion in share repurchases by years end. That is consistent with the quarterly pace we saw during the first half of the year for about $500 million per quarter. 
And as you probably saw, we just issued $700 million of new 10-year bonds with a 2.9% coupon. It is historic low for us. 
And we ended the second quarter with $176 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update in the separation of our radio business. As you heard, we filed our S-1 with the SEC a few weeks ago, which is in line with the timeline we laid out for you on our last call. While we moved forward with an IPO, we also continue to evaluate all opportunities. No matter what avenue we pursue, we are confident we will unlock significant value just as we did when we split off Outdoor. We will keep you posted on the developments in the month ahead. 
In addition, in preparation for the planned spin-off of radio, we will begin to separate our operations of our local TV and radio businesses so our Q3 financial statements will reflect those changes in our segment reporting and thus, we will report local TV and radio separately. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see in the back half of the year. We expected great year for advertising. Year-to-date, underlying network advertising was up 7%, and we anticipate a strong finish to 2016, led by our new upfront pricing as well as the strong marketplace for sports advertising that really begins with the kick off of the NFL season in September. 
For the third quarter, our TV stations are pacing to be up high single digits, driven by political advertising and radio is pacing to be up as well. 
Affiliate and subscription fees continue on their path of steady growth. We are set to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp by the end of 2016. 
And next year, we'll have 14% of our reverse comp and 24% of our retrans footprint coming up for renewal, giving us the opportunity to reset those deals to current fair market value. 
At the same time, our over-the-top service subscription services are growing and becoming a bigger contributor to our results. 
In content licensing and distribution, we see big opportunities ahead from across the company. As you heard at the CW, we've already concluded a new Netflix deal for in season and out of season content that will take effect in Q3. 
At Showtime, we expect to announce new agreements in the near-term to license our entire brand just as we previously done in Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. 
In addition, our Star Trek deals will benefit us, again, next year by both internationally and on CBS All Access. 
And at the CBS Television Network, we are launching 6 new shows in the fall and we have ownership in all of them, leading to even more future content licensing revenue. 
So in summary, our second quarter was very strong and with the presidential election, healthy gains in the upfront pricing market and a number of new ways to grow our high-margin revenue and the momentum is continuing into the back half of 2016. We continue to execute in the short term, while focusing on our long-term growth strategy. With all the opportunities ahead of us, we are confident as ever about our future. 
And above all, we are fully committed to delivering for our shareholders year in and year out. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

Let me just talk about how you thought about pricing versus volume. And I'll just ask my follow up in Over-the-top. The Showtime numbers implied by your disclosure shows some pretty healthy growth. I think you're kind of pacing along with HBO now, which is better than you would have thought given your distribution on traditional TV.

The upfront played out exactly what would have planned exactly as we drew up the playbook. All the blocking and tackling worked. If you recall the before the upfront began a few weeks before or a month before, I said we were looking for double-digit pricing. And if that was the case, we would attempt to sell in the high 70s percentage of our inventory, which is exactly what we did. We like holding back a little about 20%, a little over 20% for scatter because the scatter marketplaces increases to be strong. We saw an incredible scatter through first quarter, second quarter, third -- fourth quarter of last year, and we continue to do this. So as I said, we got double digits, we got the volume we wanted and as I said, we couldn't have drawn it out and a better. We were extremely pleased. It closed quickly, cleanly and in a very positive manner. So let the games begin."

So that continues to plug away. And yes, look I think we gave you the math on the revenue, so there's a direct correlation to subs and revenue in the OTT space, and it is our highest margin revenue for all these reasons. We take a larger share as opposed to our distributors getting a pretty fair taken that. So again, you should expect to see that to impact revenue."

In addition, once again, a lot more of the statistics came out about digital advertising and its effectiveness. And as I said in my remarks in the earnings call digital advertising works better, along with broadcast and broadcast, when you have a show like NCIS, which has 20 million viewers a week and Big Bang, which has 20 million a week, it is hard to duplicate that. So when you see scatter pricing like that, I think advertising agencies say, you know what, even though there's double-digit pricing at the upfront marketplace, I better get on in the game here or else I'm going to have to pay a lot more later on and because of those 2 factors, as I said, this came out where we anticipated it, where we wanted it and it all made sense to us."

As you've seen in our earnings announcement, CBS turned in another outstanding quarter. Revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago and considerably better than that on an underlying basis. Operating income was up 14% to $733 million, and EPS was up 26% to $0.93, the highest EPS we've ever had for a second quarter, and our 26th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Clearly, CBS continues to fire on all cylinders, and we have a number a catalysts for future growth that we're confident will drive earnings in the quarters and years to come. 
Just in the last few months, we have made many significant strides to achieve the long-term financial goals we laid out at our Investor Day in March, and we've also taken a number of additional steps to set us up for even more success. 
Let me just touch on a few of them. One, we led the upfront marketplace with double-digit pricing increases and healthy gains in volume. Next, our CBS All Access and Showtime OTT streaming services have surpassed 2 million subscribers, about evenly split and well ahead of where we thought we'd be this early in the game. 
We've licensed our Star Trek franchise in the international marketplace, guaranteeing our new series will be profitable even before it launches and begins driving subs here in the U.S. and on CBS All Access. 
We greatly expanded our SVOD revenue for the CW, ensuring its profitability for years to come. We've just licensed our Carpool Karaoke series to Apple. This represents a significant new buyer in the SVOD marketplace. 
We filed an S-1 to move ahead with our strategy to split off our radio business through an IPO or other alternatives. And we issued $700 million of debt with the best rate in the history of our company and one of the best rates ever in our industry. 
In addition to all of this, we announced this morning that we'd be raising our dividend by 20% and we've expanded our share buyback program to a new authorization totaling $6 billion. 
Returning cash to shareholders in a prudent manner remains a priority for us. We first invest in our business and then return the excess cash, something we have consistently done year in and year out. At the same time, we are laser-focused on investing in our core competency, which is creating and distributing premium content across platforms all around the world. 
As our second quarter demonstrates, we continue to have tremendous success in this regard, and there is lots more to come. 
It all starts with the CBS Television Network where we are looking forward to launching our new primetime lineup this fall. We have an enviable mix of strong freshman series, growing young franchises and established hits. 
Very importantly, we will own more than 80% of our schedule, including ownership in every single one of our 6 new series. Each show represents another opportunity to license our content for many, many years. Plus these shows will have the best chance of success by virtue of launching with the promotional power of the #1 network in the world as well as Thursday Night Football. 
When it comes to recognizing the strength and stability of our primetime schedule, the advertisers have spoken. We just concluded the strongest upfront we've seen in many years. As was widely reported, significant dollars flowed back to broadcast television. Marketers realized what we've been saying for a long time that digital buys are more powerful when they complement television buys, not when they replace them. So broadcast TV had a banner upfront and CBS was at the front of the pack. 
Not only did we lead the market in pricing with double-digit increases, but we saw very healthy gains in volume as well. We also had an extremely strong upfront across all the day parts. 
In late night, pricing increases were even more than primetime. As we've seen during the conventions, Stephen Colbert continues to gain attention for his wit and political commentary. And in 12:30, James Corden has become a phenomenon. He hosted the highest-rated Tony Awards in 15 years and his show just received 4 Emmy nominations. 
In addition, we are now licensing both of our late night shows internationally for substantial revenue. Once again, our new ownership position in both of these franchises is allowing us to monetize these shows in ways we never could before. Late night television has now become considerably more profitable with Colbert and Corden. 
We also continue to solidify our future in big event television. Last month, we announced that the GRAMMYs will remain on CBS through 2026. When you have this extension to our current deal, it means we will have the GRAMMYs for 54 consecutive years, the longest continuous partnership between an award show and a broadcaster in television history. 
Taken together with our agreement to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032, we have locked up big event programming for a long, long time. 
At CBS News, we continue to see growth in all of our key broadcasts, leading to a very strong upfront in this day part as well. CBS evening news has added 1.5 million viewers since Scott Kelly became anchor 5 years ago, that's double the growth of ABC and NBC combined, and CBS This Morning have been growing its viewers month after month, and during the quarter, had its highest numbers in nearly 3 decades. And our weekend news broadcast, 48 hours, CBS Sunday Morning, Face the Nation and 60 Minutes continue to be #1 in their respective categories. 
The quality of these shows was demonstrated last week when CBS News was nominated for 37 Emmy Awards more than any other news organization or cable network. 
In addition, we are also growing CBSN, our online news network. Big breaking news events and our political coverage are driving viewership, including another month of record views in June, and new record high of more than 7 million streams just last week during the Republican convention. 
We've also recently broadened the reach of CBSN with the new Apple TV partnership and a deal with Twitter to stream the Republican and Democratic conventions. 
So from news, to sports, to entertainment, our base advertising business remains strong, and it's important to note that in addition to higher upfront pricing, we see continued strength in advertising right through the second half of the year. At the same time, our non-advertising revenues, which are all the ways we monetize our programming through retrans and reverse comp, international syndication, SVOD and over-the-top continue to drive our results as well. One of the areas this is especially true is at the CW, where as I mentioned, we announced a new multiyear licensing agreement with Netflix that allows for full season streaming of every show 8 days after its current season finale. 
This deal allows us to maximize the value of our content, while also building for our broadcast affiliates, the CW.com, our MVPD partners and potential OTT partners as well. 
We also struck a significant international deal with Netflix through Star Trek, licensing our new series, Star Trek Discovery, to 188 Netflix countries around the world, virtually everywhere but North America. In addition, we also licensed all 727 previous episodes of our Star Trek library. 
Plus we struck a similar deal with Bell Media for Canada. As a result, Star Trek Discovery, our new series, is profitable, and we haven't even begun production. And we still have additional windows to sell the show in second and third cycles down the road. It's also safe to say that Star Trek will lead to a significant bump in subscribers for CBS All Access here in the U.S. And in addition to Star Trek, we have the upcoming Good Wife spinoff coming to All Access, along with other original programming that we will be announcing soon. 
So we're just getting started, and we're already well on our way. We're also very pleased with the progress of our Showtime over-the-top streaming product as well. 
As you recall, we set a goal of 8 million subscribers between All Access and Showtime OTT by 2020, representing $800 million in new revenue. With more than 2 million subs between them already, we're confident that this will be easily achieved. 
One of the ways we're growing our Showtime subs is by staggering the launch dates of our original series. The season 4 premiere of Ray Donovan led to a significant lift in streaming subscribers here in July, and looking ahead, we will have Shameless, The Affair and Homeland, all premiering in different months between now and January. And of course, we have the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks coming in early 2017 as well. David Lynch and Mark Frost, the creators of this franchise, have just finished shooting the new series, which includes many actors from the original cast and some terrific guest stars. 
Like Star Trek, Twin Peaks has an extremely loyal an avid fan base. So we could expect to see another surge in subs to Showtime OTT when this show premieres next year. 
Turning to Publishing. We have 2 big titles coming up that will drive our second half. Born to Run, the highly anticipated memoir by Bruce Springsteen, and the latest from comedienne, Amy Schumer, called, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo. 
In addition, Simon & Schuster continues to generate content that spawns new projects across our company. The latest is a movie from CBS Films that is based on American Assassin from the best-selling series of action thrillers by Vince Flynn. It stars Michael Keaton and will begin filming next month. 
At our TV stations, we are still in the early stages of what we are very confident will be a record presidential election year. Second quarter political sales came in higher than expected, thanks in part to primary spending in California. And right now, we're seeing big activity in many of our major market O&Os. 
As always, spending will peak in the fourth quarter, not only at the top of the ticket, but as the gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional races as well, where tickets are not quite as unified as they've been in past elections. 
In radio, we have taken a major step forward in terms of separating this business from CBS with the filing of our S-1. We're also continuing to talk about other potential alternatives. Just like we did with outdoor, our strategy is to maximize the value of this asset, while centering our company around the premium content that can best drive our results. 
So across our company, we're executing the strategy that we have laid out for our investors, and we are building on that strategy all the time. As we look ahead, every single opportunity that we evaluate has to fit the same criteria. Does it benefit CBS shareholders? From the investment of capital to the return of capital, to any potential M&A, CBS shareholders are always our priority. The good news is that we have already have the assets and the strategy to deliver on all of our financial objectives. The even better news is that there are new catalysts for growth being hatched all the time. 
The ways we can marry together our premium content with new technologies are growing every day, and we will continue to take advantage of every one of them. 
So it was a terrific quarter. Our business is thriving, and we see growth opportunities ahead that are more exciting than ever. As those opportunities unfold, we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have laid out for you, just as we always do. We are already looking forward to updating you on our next call. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

On the top line, we had a very strong quarter as well. Total revenue was up 2% at $3.3 billion, although that doesn't tell the entire story. During the second quarter, we were comping against 2 significant events from last year. First, we had the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, which was the highest-grossing sporting event of all time; and second, last year, we had the NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship game on CBS, which, as you know, [indiscernible] to us every other year. 
Taken together, these 2 events would have added 6 percentage points of growth to us in the second quarter. So therefore, underlying revenue was extremely healthy for the quarter. 
Now let me give you some more details about our second quarter results. As I just mentioned, we had the NCAA Men's Championship game last year. As a result, advertising revenue for the second quarter came in at $1.55 billion compared with $1.59 billion in 2015. However, underlying network advertising grew 2% during this year's second quarter. And as you've heard, we recently concluded our upfront with strong pricing across all day parts. 
Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was $733 million to the quarter compared with $752 million last year. However, excluding the Mayweather fight, underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenue grew 18%. Retrans and reverse comp was up 44%, and Showtime's affiliate fees were up a solid 5%. 
As you heard, our over-the-top subscription services are also contributing to our growth and continue to track nicely above our expectations. 
Content licensing was up 16% during the second quarter, and we saw strength both domestically and internationally. As an example, the ways we are monetizing Star Trek demonstrate just how we can benefit from a single content franchise again and again. So the opportunities presented by owning premium content continue to be robust. 
Growth in our high-margin revenue streams led to a 14% increase in operating income, which came in at $733 million during the second quarter, and our operating income margin expanded by more than 200 basis points to 22%. 
In addition, net earnings were up 16% to $423 million for the second quarter and EPS was up 26% to $0.93. Our results on a year-to-date basis were equally impressive. Revenue of $7.1 billion was up 6%, operating income of $1.5 billion was up 15%, and EPS of $1.95 was up 29%. 
Now let's turn to our operating segment. Entertainment revenue in the second quarter came in at $1.95 billion, up 9% with strength across the board. As I mentioned, underlying network advertising grew 2%. Content licensing and distribution was up 19%, thanks in part to our Star Trek deals, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 59%, driven by higher retrans and reverse comp as well as growth at CBS All Access. 
Entertainment operating income of $351 million for the second quarter was up 34% due to the strong gains in our high-margin revenue streams, and our entertainment operating income margin expanded 3 points to 18%. 
At our Cable Network segment, second quarter revenue came in at $536 million, down 13% from last year when we had the big pay-per-view fight, which affected the revenue comparison by 24 points. Underlying cable network revenue grew 11%, primarily due to the licensing of our Showtime brand and original series as well as higher affiliate and subscription fees. 
Second quarter cable operating income of $227 million was up 3%, thanks to increases in our higher-margin revenue streams, which drove operating income growth even as we continue to invest in original programming. And our cable operating income margin expanded 6 points to 42%, and we expect further margin expansion from here as we move into the back half of 2016. 
Turning to Publishing. Second quarter revenue came in at $187 million compared with $199 million last year due to the timing of releases. Best-selling titles for the second quarter included End of Watch by Stephen King and Foreign Agent by Brad Thor. And as Les just mentioned, we have a strong release schedule ahead. 
Publishing operating income for the second quarter of $26 million was up 4% as a result of lower cost. And our Publishing operating margin expanded more than 100 basis points to 14%. 
In Local Broadcasting, second quarter revenue came in at $647 million compared with $654 million in 2015, with the decline entirely driven by comping against last year's NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game. 
Underlying Local Broadcasting revenue was even with 2015 with TV stations up 1% and radio stations down 1%. 
Looking ahead, we expect political spending to kick in fully during the back half of 2016, with Q4 being the strongest. 
Local Broadcasting operating income for the second quarter was up 7% to $212 million, driven by the restructuring activity we put in place last year. Those actions also resulted in our operating income margin expanding 3 points to a solid 33%. 
Turning to cash flow on our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion compared with $835 million in 2015, up 41% due to the growth in underlying advertising revenue, higher affiliate and subscription fees and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. 
Also during the first half of 2016, we bought back 19.5 million shares of our stock for $1 billion. As we stated in the past, we expect to complete another $1 billion in share repurchases by year's end. That is consistent with the quarterly pace you saw during the first half of the year or about $500 million per quarter. 
And as you probably saw, we just issued $700 million of new 10-year bonds with a 2.9% coupon, a historic low for us. And we ended the second quarter with $176 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the separation of our radio business. As you heard, we filed our S-1 with the SEC a few weeks ago, which is in line with the timeline we laid out for you on our last call. While we move forward with an IPO, we also continue to evaluate all opportunities. No matter what avenue we pursue, we are confident we will unlock significant value, just as we did when we split off Outdoor. We will keep you posted on the developments in the months ahead. 
In addition, in preparation for the planned split off of radio, we will begin to separate our operations of our local TV and radio businesses, so our Q3 financial statements will reflect those changes in our segment reporting, and thus, we will report local TV and radio separately. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see in the back half of the year. We expect a great year for advertising. Year-to-date, underlying network advertising was up 7%, and we anticipate a strong finish to 2016, led by our new upfront pricing as well as the strong marketplace for sports advertising that really begins with the kickoff of the NFL season in September. 
For the third quarter, our TV stations are pacing to be up high single digits, driven by political advertising, and radio is pacing to be up as well. Affiliate and subscription fees continue on their path of steady growth. We are set to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp by the end of 2016. And next year, we'll have 14% of our reverse comp and 24% of our retrans footprint coming up for renewal, giving us the opportunity to reset those deals to current fair market value. At the same time, our over-the-top service subscription services are growing and becoming a bigger contributor to our results. 
In content licensing and distribution, we see big opportunities ahead from across the company. As you heard, at the CW, we've already concluded a new Netflix deal for in season and out of season content that will take effect in Q3. 
At Showtime, we expect to announce new agreements in the near-term to license our entire brand, just as we've previously done in Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. 
In addition, our Star Trek deals will benefit us again next year by both internationally and on CBS All Access. And at the CBS Television Network, we are launching 6 new shows in the fall and we have ownership in all of them, leading to even more future content licensing revenue. 
So in summary, our second quarter was very strong, and with the presidential election, healthy gains in the upfront pricing market and a number of new ways to grow our high-margin revenue, the momentum is continuing into the back half of 2016. We continue to execute in the short term, while focusing on our long-term growth strategy. With all the opportunities ahead of us, we are confident as ever about our future. 
And above all, we are fully committed to delivering for our shareholders year in and year out. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

Let me just talk about how you thought about pricing versus volume. And I'll just ask my follow up in over-the-top. The Showtime numbers implied by your disclosure shows some pretty healthy growth. And I think you're kind of pacing along with HBO now, which is better than you would have thought given your distribution on traditional TV.

If you recall, before the upfront began a few weeks before or a month before, I said we were looking for double-digit pricing. And if that was the case, we would attempt to sell in the high 70s percentage of our inventory, which is exactly what we did. We like holding back a little, about 20%, a little over 20% for scatter because the scatter marketplaces increases to be strong. We saw an incredible scatter through first quarter, second quarter, third -- fourth quarter of last year, and we continue to do this. So as I said, we got double digits, we got the volume we wanted, and as I said, we couldn't have drawn it out any better. We were extremely pleased. It closed quickly, cleanly and in a very positive manner. So let the games begin."

We take the largest share as opposed to our distributors getting a pretty share of taking that. So again, you should expect to see that to impact revenue."

In addition, once again, a lot more of the statistics came out about digital advertising and its effectiveness. And as I said in my remarks in the earnings call, digital advertising works better along with broadcast, and broadcast, when you have a show like NCIS, which has 20 million viewers a week, and Big Bang, which has 20 million a week, it is hard to duplicate that. So when you see scatter pricing like that, I think, advertising agencies say, you know what, even though there's double-digit pricing at the upfront marketplace, I better get on in the game here or else I'm going to have to pay a lot more later on. And because of those 2 factors, as I said, this came out where we anticipated it, where we wanted it and it all made sense to us."

There will eventually be a package where you can get Showtime OTT and CBS All Access together at a potential slight discount. But as of now, these 2 million are not crossed whatsoever. So they're not bundled. Regarding the weekly, I guess, you're referring to that Star Trek is going to be put out 1 episode at a time. We think that's the right way to go in this, and we think that's the better way to go. The Showtime version is the monthly as opposed to launching, in a quarter, 2 shows at the same time. We have spread it out, so that there's a new show, there's a new offering on Showtime once a month or thereabouts all the way. It's not only to help streaming, it's just to help viewership in general. I think, people want more new stuff and they'd rather have one beginning in September, one beginning in October, and then 2 beginning in September. So we're doing that. We think it's the right way to do it, and we are different than Netflix in a lot of ways."

As you've seen in our earnings announcement, CBS turned in another outstanding quarter. Revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago and considerably better than that on an underlying basis. Operating income was up 14% to $733 million, and EPS was up 26% to $0.93, the highest EPS we've ever had for a second quarter, and our 26th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Clearly, CBS continues to fire on all cylinders, and we have a number a catalysts for future growth that we're confident will drive earnings in the quarters and years to come. 
Just in the last few months, we have made many significant strides to achieve the long-term financial goals we laid out at our Investor Day in March, and we've also taken a number of additional steps to set us up for even more success. 
Let me just touch on a few of them. One, we led the upfront marketplace with double-digit pricing increases and healthy gains in volume. Next, our CBS All Access and Showtime OTT streaming services have surpassed 2 million subscribers, about evenly split and well ahead of where we thought we'd be this early in the game. 
We've licensed our Star Trek franchise in the international marketplace, guaranteeing our new series will be profitable even before it launches and begins driving subs here in the U.S. and on CBS All Access. 
We greatly expanded our SVOD revenue for the CW, ensuring its profitability for years to come. We've just licensed our Carpool Karaoke series to Apple. This represents a significant new buyer in the SVOD marketplace. 
We filed an S-1 to move ahead with our strategy to split off our radio business through an IPO or other alternatives. And we issued $700 million of debt with the best rate in the history of our company and one of the best rates ever in our industry. 
In addition to all of this, we announced this morning that we'd be raising our dividend by 20% and we've expanded our share buyback program to a new authorization totaling $6 billion. 
Returning cash to shareholders in a prudent manner remains a priority for us. We first invest in our business and then return the excess cash, something we have consistently done year in and year out. At the same time, we are laser-focused on investing in our core competency, which is creating and distributing premium content across platforms all around the world. 
As our second quarter demonstrates, we continue to have tremendous success in this regard, and there is lots more to come. 
It all starts with the CBS Television Network where we are looking forward to launching our new primetime lineup this fall. We have an enviable mix of strong freshman series, growing young franchises and established hits. 
Very importantly, we will own more than 80% of our schedule, including ownership in every single one of our 6 new series. Each show represents another opportunity to license our content for many, many years. Plus these shows will have the best chance of success by virtue of launching with the promotional power of the #1 network in the world as well as Thursday Night Football. 
When it comes to recognizing the strength and stability of our primetime schedule, the advertisers have spoken. We just concluded the strongest upfront we've seen in many years. As was widely reported, significant dollars flowed back to broadcast television. Marketers realized what we've been saying for a long time: that digital buys are more powerful when they complement television buys, not when they replace them. So broadcast TV had a banner upfront and CBS was at the front of the pack. 
Not only did we lead the market in pricing with double-digit increases, but we saw very healthy gains in volume as well. We also had an extremely strong upfront across other day parts. 
In late night, pricing increases were even more than primetime. As we've seen during the conventions, Stephen Colbert continues to gain attention for his wit and political commentary. And in 12:30, James Corden has become a phenomenon. He hosted the highest-rated Tony Awards in 15 years, and his show just received 4 Emmy nominations. 
In addition, we are now licensing both of our late night shows internationally for substantial revenue. Once again, our new ownership position in both of these franchises is allowing us to monetize these shows in ways we never could before. Late night television has now become considerably more profitable with Colbert and Corden. 
We also continue to solidify our future in big event television. Last month, we announced that the GRAMMYs will remain on CBS through 2026. When you add this extension to our current deal, it means we will have the GRAMMYs for 54 consecutive years, the longest continuous partnership between an award show and a broadcaster in television history. 
Taken together with our agreement to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032, we have locked up big event programming for a long, long time. 
At CBS News, we continue to see growth in all of our key broadcasts, leading to a very strong upfront in this day part as well. CBS evening news has added 1.5 million viewers since Scott Kelly became anchor 5 years ago, that's double the growth of ABC and NBC combined, and CBS This Morning has been growing its viewers month after month, and during the quarter, had its highest numbers in nearly 3 decades. And our weekend news broadcasts, 48 hours, CBS Sunday Morning, Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, continue to be #1 in their respective categories. 
The quality of these shows was demonstrated last week when CBS News was nominated for 37 Emmy Awards, more than any other news organization or cable network. 
In addition, we are also growing CBSN, our online news network. Big breaking news events and our political coverage are driving viewership, including another month of record views in June, and new record high of more than 7 million streams just last week during the Republican convention. 
We've also recently broadened the reach of CBSN with the new Apple TV partnership and a deal with Twitter to stream the Republican and Democratic conventions. 
So from news, to sports, to entertainment, our base advertising business remains strong, and it's important to note that in addition to higher upfront pricing, we see continued strength in advertising right through the second half of the year. At the same time, our non-advertising revenues, which are all the ways we monetize our programming through retrans and reverse comp, international syndication, SVOD and over-the-top continue to drive our results as well. One of the areas this is especially true is at the CW, where as I mentioned, we announced a new multiyear licensing agreement with Netflix that allows for full season streaming of every show 8 days after its current season finale. 
This deal allows us to maximize the value of our content, while also building for our broadcast affiliates, the CW.com, our MVPD partners and potential OTT partners as well. 
We also struck a significant international deal with Netflix through Star Trek, licensing our new series, Star Trek Discovery, to 188 Netflix countries around the world, virtually everywhere but North America. In addition, we also licensed all 727 previous episodes of our Star Trek library. 
Plus we struck a similar deal with Bell Media for Canada. As a result, Star Trek Discovery, our new series, is profitable, and we haven't even begun production. And we still have additional windows to sell the show in second and third cycles down the road. It's also safe to say that Star Trek will lead to a significant bump in subscribers for CBS All Access here in the U.S. And in addition to Star Trek, we have the upcoming Good Wife spinoff coming to All Access, along with other original programming that we will be announcing soon. 
So we're just getting started, and we're already well on our way. We're also very pleased with the progress of our Showtime over-the-top streaming product as well. 
As you recall, we set a goal of 8 million subscribers between All Access and Showtime OTT by 2020, representing $800 million in new revenue. With more than 2 million subs between them already, we're confident that this will be easily achieved. 
One of the ways we're growing our Showtime subs is by staggering the launch dates of our original series. The season 4 premiere of Ray Donovan led to a significant lift in streaming subscribers here in July, and looking ahead, we will have Shameless, The Affair and Homeland all premiering in different months between now and January. And of course, we have the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks coming in early 2017 as well. David Lynch and Mark Frost, the creators of this franchise, have just finished shooting the new series, which includes many actors from the original cast and some terrific guest stars. 
Like Star Trek, Twin Peaks has an extremely loyal and avid fan base. So we could expect to see another surge in subs to Showtime OTT when this show premieres next year. 
Turning to Publishing. We have 2 big titles coming up that will drive our second half. Born to Run, the highly anticipated memoir by Bruce Springsteen, and the latest from comedienne Amy Schumer, called The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo. 
In addition, Simon & Schuster continues to generate content that spawns new projects across our company. The latest is a movie from CBS Films that is based on American Assassin from the best-selling series of action thrillers by Vince Flynn. It stars Michael Keaton and will begin filming next month. 
At our TV stations, we are still in the early stages of what we are very confident will be a record presidential election year. Second quarter political sales came in higher than expected, thanks in part to primary spending in California. And right now, we're seeing big activity in many of our major market O&Os. 
As always, spending will peak in the fourth quarter, not only at the top of the ticket, but at the gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional races as well, where tickets are not quite as unified as they've been in past elections. 
In radio, we have taken a major step forward in terms of separating this business from CBS with the filing of our S-1. We're also continuing to talk about other potential alternatives. Just like we did with outdoor, our strategy is to maximize the value of this asset while centering our company around the premium content that can best drive our results. 
So across our company, we're executing the strategy that we have laid out for our investors, and we are building on that strategy all the time. As we look ahead, every single opportunity that we evaluate has to fit the same criteria. Does it benefit CBS shareholders? From the investment of capital to the return of capital, to any potential M&A, CBS shareholders are always our priority. The good news is that we have already have the assets and the strategy to deliver on all of our financial objectives. The even better news is that there are new catalysts for growth being hatched all the time. 
The ways we can marry together our premium content with new technologies are growing every day, and we will continue to take advantage of every one of them. 
So it was a terrific quarter. Our business is thriving, and we see growth opportunities ahead that are more exciting than ever. As those opportunities unfold, we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have laid out for you, just as we always do. We are already looking forward to updating you on our next call. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that once again reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in owning more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing",1584,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that once again reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in owning more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing our recurring revenue from places like retrans and reverse comp, SVOD, international content licensing and our over-the-top subscription services. 
As a result, we delivered healthy double-digit growth in our key profit measures, even as we continue to invest in our future success. 
On the top line, we had a very strong quarter as well. Total revenue was up 2% at $3.3 billion, although that doesn't tell the entire story. During the second quarter, we were comping against 2 significant events from last year. First, we had the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, which was the highest-grossing sporting event of all time; and second, last year, we had the NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship game on CBS, which, as you know, rotates to us every other year. 
Taken together, these 2 events would have added 6 percentage points of growth to us in the second quarter. So therefore, underlying revenue was extremely healthy for the quarter. 
Now let me give you some more details about our second quarter results. As I just mentioned, we had the NCAA Men's Championship game last year. As a result, advertising revenue for the second quarter came in at $1.55 billion compared with $1.59 billion in 2015. However, underlying network advertising grew 2% during this year's second quarter. And as you've heard, we recently concluded our upfront with strong pricing across all day parts. 
Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was $733 million for the quarter compared with $752 million last year. However, excluding the Mayweather fight, underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenue grew 18%. Retrans and reverse comp was up 44%, and Showtime's affiliate fees were up a solid 5%. 
As you heard, our over-the-top subscription services are also contributing to our growth and continue to track nicely above our expectations. 
Content licensing was up 16% during the second quarter, and we saw strength both domestically and internationally. As an example, the ways we are monetizing Star Trek demonstrate just how we can benefit from a single content franchise again and again. So the opportunities presented by owning premium content continue to be robust. 
Growth in our high-margin revenue streams led to a 14% increase in operating income, which came in at $733 million during the second quarter, and our operating income margin expanded by more than 200 basis points to 22%. 
In addition, net earnings were up 16% to $423 million for the second quarter, and EPS was up 26% to $0.93. Our results on a year-to-date basis were equally impressive. Revenue of $7.1 billion was up 6%, operating income of $1.5 billion was up 15%, and EPS of $1.95 was up 29%. 
Now let's turn to our operating segment. Entertainment revenue in the second quarter came in at $1.95 billion, up 9% with strength across the board. As I mentioned, underlying network advertising grew 2%. Content licensing and distribution was up 19%, thanks in part to our Star Trek deals, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 59%, driven by higher retrans and reverse comp as well as growth at CBS All Access. 
Entertainment operating income of $351 million for the second quarter was up 34% due to the strong gains in our high-margin revenue streams, and our entertainment operating income margin expanded 3 points to 18%. 
At our Cable Network segment, second quarter revenue came in at $536 million, down 13% from last year when we had the big pay-per-view fight, which affected the revenue comparison by 24 points. Underlying cable network revenue grew 11%, primarily due to the licensing of our Showtime brand and original series as well as higher affiliate and subscription fees. 
Second quarter cable operating income of $227 million was up 3%, thanks to increases in our higher-margin revenue streams, which drove operating income growth even as we continue to invest in original programming. And our cable operating income margin expanded 6 points to 42%, and we expect further margin expansion from here as we move into the back half of 2016. 
Turning to Publishing. Second quarter revenue came in at $187 million compared with $199 million last year due to the timing of releases. Best-selling titles for the second quarter included End of Watch by Stephen King and Foreign Agent by Brad Thor. And as Les just mentioned, we have a strong release schedule ahead. 
Publishing operating income for the second quarter of $26 million was up 4% as a result of lower cost. And our Publishing operating income margin expanded more than 100 basis points to 14%. 
In Local Broadcasting, second quarter revenue came in at $647 million compared with $654 million in 2015, with the decline entirely driven by comping against last year's NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game. 
Underlying Local Broadcasting revenue was even with 2015 with TV stations up 1% and radio stations down 1%. 
Looking ahead, we expect political spending to kick in fully during the back half of 2016, with Q4 being the strongest. 
Local Broadcasting operating income for the second quarter was up 7% to $212 million, driven by the restructuring activity we put in place last year. Those actions also resulted in our operating income margin expanding 3 points to a solid 33%. 
Turning to cash flow on our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion compared with $835 million in 2015, up 41% due to the growth in underlying advertising revenue, higher affiliate and subscription fees and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. 
Also during the first half of 2016, we bought back 19.5 million shares of our stock for $1 billion. As we stated in the past, we expect to complete another $1 billion in share repurchases by year's end. That is consistent with the quarterly pace you saw during the first half of the year or about $500 million per quarter. 
And as you probably saw, we just issued $700 million of new 10-year bonds with a 2.9% coupon, a historic low for us. And we ended the second quarter with $176 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the separation of our radio business. As you heard, we filed our S-1 with the SEC a few weeks ago, which is in line with the timeline we laid out for you on our last call. While we move forward with an IPO, we also continue to evaluate all opportunities. No matter what avenue we pursue, we are confident we will unlock significant value, just as we did when we split off Outdoor. We will keep you posted on the developments in the months ahead. 
In addition, in preparation for the planned split off of radio, we will begin to separate our operations of our local TV and radio businesses, so our Q3 financial statements will reflect those changes in our segment reporting, and thus, we will report local TV and radio separately. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see in the back half of the year. We expect a great year for advertising. Year-to-date, underlying network advertising was up 7%, and we anticipate a strong finish to 2016, led by our new upfront pricing as well as the strong marketplace for sports advertising that really begins with the kickoff of the NFL season in September. 
For the third quarter, our TV stations are pacing to be up high single digits, driven by political advertising, and radio is pacing to be up as well. Affiliate and subscription fees continue on their path of steady growth. We are set to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp by the end of 2016. And next year, we'll have 14% of our reverse comp and 24% of our retrans footprint coming up for renewal, giving us the opportunity to reset those deals to current fair market value. At the same time, our over-the-top service subscription services are growing and becoming a bigger contributor to our results. 
In content licensing and distribution, we see big opportunities ahead from across the company. As you heard, at the CW, we've already concluded a new Netflix deal for in season and out of season content that will take effect in Q3. 
At Showtime, we expect to announce new agreements in the near-term to license our entire brand, just as we've previously done in Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. 
In addition, our Star Trek deals will benefit us again next year by both internationally and on CBS All Access. And at the CBS Television Network, we are launching 6 new shows in the fall, and we have ownership in all of them, leading to even more future content licensing revenue. 
So in summary, our second quarter was very strong, and with the presidential election, healthy gains in the upfront pricing market and a number of new ways to grow our high-margin revenue, the momentum is continuing into the back half of 2016. We continue to execute in the short term, while focusing on our long-term growth strategy. With all the opportunities ahead of us, we are confident as ever about our future. 
And above all, we are fully committed to delivering for our shareholders year in and year out. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

The upfront sort of played out exactly like we would have planned, exactly as we drew up the playbook. All the blocking and tackling worked. If you recall, before the upfront began a few weeks before or a month before, I said we were looking for double-digit pricing. And if that was the case, we would attempt to sell in the high 70s percentage of our inventory, which is exactly what we did. We like holding back a little, about 20%, a little over 20% for scatter because the scatter marketplaces increases to be strong. We saw an incredible scatter through first quarter, second quarter, third -- fourth quarter of last year, and we continue to do this. So as I said, we got double digits, we got the volume we wanted, and as I said, we couldn't have drawn it out any better. We were extremely pleased. It closed quickly, cleanly and in a very positive manner. So let the games begin."

So that continues to plug away. And yes, look, I think, we gave you the math on the revenue, so there's a direct correlation to subs and revenue in the OTT space, and it is our highest margin revenue for obvious reasons. We take the largest share as opposed to our distributors getting a pretty fair take in that. So again, you should expect to see that to impact revenue."

In addition, once again, a lot more of the statistics came out about digital advertising and its effectiveness. And as I said in my remarks during the earnings call, digital advertising works better along with broadcast, and broadcast, when you have a show like NCIS, which has 20 million viewers a week, and Big Bang, which has 20 million a week, it is hard to duplicate that. So when you see scatter pricing like that, I think, advertising agencies say, you know what, even though there's double-digit pricing at the upfront marketplace, I better get on -- in the game here or else I'm going to have to pay a lot more later on. And because of those 2 factors, as I said, this came out where we anticipated it, where we wanted it and it all made sense to us."

And so it's that kind of 12 million folks, so we don't think people are cutting or switch their -- we think they added. So out of our couple million subscribers, they probably also have a Netflix subscription as well and subs.

I often point back to CSI was the 9:00 show on Friday night, and we had a show that I thought was going to be a hit at 8:00 called The Fugitive, we were doing a remake with Tim Daly. That was going to be the big hit. And by week 2, we realized CSI was the big hit. So Pure Genius is a very unusual show. It's a real quality show.

Let me just touch on a few of them. One, we led the upfront marketplace with double-digit pricing increases and healthy gains in volume. Next, our CBS All Access and Showtime OTT streaming services have surpassed 2 million subscribers, about evenly split and well ahead of where we thought we'd be this early in the game. 
We've licensed our Star Trek franchise in the international marketplace, guaranteeing our new series will be profitable even before it launches and begins driving subs here in the U.S. and on CBS All Access. 
We greatly expanded our SVOD revenue for the CW, ensuring its profitability for years to come. We've just licensed our Carpool Karaoke series to Apple. This represents a significant new buyer in the SVOD marketplace. 
We filed an S-1 to move ahead with our strategy to split off our radio business through an IPO or other alternatives. And we issued $700 million of debt with the best rate in the history of our company and one of the best rates ever in our industry. 
In addition to all of this, we announced this morning that we'd be raising our dividend by 20% and we've expanded our share buyback program to a new authorization totaling $6 billion. 
Returning cash to shareholders in a prudent manner remains a priority for us. We first invest in our business and then return the excess cash, something we have consistently done year in and year out. At the same time, we are laser-focused on investing in our core competency, which is creating and distributing premium content across platforms all around the world. 
As our second quarter demonstrates, we continue to have tremendous success in this regard, and there is lots more to come. 
It all starts with the CBS Television Network where we are looking forward to launching our new primetime lineup this fall. We have an enviable mix of strong freshman series, growing young franchises and established hits. 
Very importantly, we will own more than 80% of our schedule, including ownership in every single one of our 6 new series. Each show represents another opportunity to license our content for many, many years. Plus these shows will have the best chance of success by virtue of launching with the promotional power of the #1 network in the world as well as Thursday Night Football. 
When it comes to recognizing the strength and stability of our primetime schedule, the advertisers have spoken. We just concluded the strongest upfront we've seen in many years. As was widely reported, significant dollars flowed back to broadcast television. Marketers realized what we've been saying for a long time: that digital buys are more powerful when they complement television buys, not when they replace them. So broadcast TV had a banner upfront and CBS was at the front of the pack. 
Not only did we lead the market in pricing with double-digit increases, but we saw very healthy gains in volume as well. We also had an extremely strong upfront across other day parts. 
In late night, pricing increases were even more than primetime. As we've seen during the conventions, Stephen Colbert continues to gain attention for his wit and political commentary. And in 12:30, James Corden has become a phenomenon. He hosted the highest-rated Tony Awards in 15 years, and his show just received 4 Emmy nominations. 
In addition, we are now licensing both of our late night shows internationally for substantial revenue. Once again, our new ownership position in both of these franchises is allowing us to monetize these shows in ways we never could before. Late night television has now become considerably more profitable with Colbert and Corden. 
We also continue to solidify our future in big event television. Last month, we announced that the GRAMMYs will remain on CBS through 2026. When you add this extension to our current deal, it means we will have the GRAMMYs for 54 consecutive years, the longest continuous partnership between an award show and a broadcaster in television history. 
Taken together with our agreement to broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament until 2032, we have locked up big event programming for a long, long time. 
At CBS News, we continue to see growth in all of our key broadcasts, leading to a very strong upfront in this day part as well. CBS evening news has added 1.5 million viewers since Scott Kelly became anchor 5 years ago, that's double the growth of ABC and NBC combined, and CBS This Morning has been growing its viewers month after month, and during the quarter, had its highest numbers in nearly 3 decades. And our weekend news broadcasts, 48 hours, CBS Sunday Morning, Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, continue to be #1 in their respective categories. 
The quality of these shows was demonstrated last week when CBS News was nominated for 37 Emmy Awards, more than any other news organization or cable network. 
In addition, we are also growing CBSN, our online news network. Big breaking news events and our political coverage are driving viewership, including another month of record views in June, and new record high of more than 7 million streams just last week during the Republican convention. 
We've also recently broadened the reach of CBSN with the new Apple TV partnership and a deal with Twitter to stream the Republican and Democratic conventions. 
So from news, to sports, to entertainment, our base advertising business remains strong, and it's important to note that in addition to higher upfront pricing, we see continued strength in advertising right through the second half of the year. At the same time, our non-advertising revenues, which are all the ways we monetize our programming through retrans and reverse comp, international syndication, SVOD and over-the-top continue to drive our results as well. One of the areas this is especially true is at the CW, where as I mentioned, we announced a new multiyear licensing agreement with Netflix that allows for full season streaming of every show 8 days after its current season finale. 
This deal allows us to maximize the value of our content, while also building for our broadcast affiliates, the CW.com, our MVPD partners and potential OTT partners as well. 
We also struck a significant international deal with Netflix through Star Trek, licensing our new series, Star Trek Discovery, to 188 Netflix countries around the world, virtually everywhere but North America. In addition, we also licensed all 727 previous episodes of our Star Trek library. 
Plus we struck a similar deal with Bell Media for Canada. As a result, Star Trek Discovery, our new series, is profitable, and we haven't even begun production. And we still have additional windows to sell the show in second and third cycles down the road. It's also safe to say that Star Trek will lead to a significant bump in subscribers for CBS All Access here in the U.S. And in addition to Star Trek, we have the upcoming Good Wife spinoff coming to All Access, along with other original programming that we will be announcing soon. 
So we're just getting started, and we're already well on our way. We're also very pleased with the progress of our Showtime over-the-top streaming product as well. 
As you recall, we set a goal of 8 million subscribers between All Access and Showtime OTT by 2020, representing $800 million in new revenue. With more than 2 million subs between them already, we're confident that this will be easily achieved. 
One of the ways we're growing our Showtime subs is by staggering the launch dates of our original series. The season 4 premiere of Ray Donovan led to a significant lift in streaming subscribers here in July, and looking ahead, we will have Shameless, The Affair and Homeland all premiering in different months between now and January. And of course, we have the highly anticipated return of Twin Peaks coming in early 2017 as well. David Lynch and Mark Frost, the creators of this franchise, have just finished shooting the new series, which includes many actors from the original cast and some terrific guest stars. 
Like Star Trek, Twin Peaks has an extremely loyal and avid fan base. So we could expect to see another surge in subs to Showtime OTT when this show premieres next year. 
Turning to Publishing. We have 2 big titles coming up that will drive our second half. Born to Run, the highly anticipated memoir by Bruce Springsteen, and the latest from comedienne Amy Schumer, called The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo. 
In addition, Simon & Schuster continues to generate content that spawns new projects across our company. The latest is a movie from CBS Films that is based on American Assassin from the best-selling series of action thrillers by Vince Flynn. It stars Michael Keaton and will begin filming next month. 
At our TV stations, we are still in the early stages of what we are very confident will be a record presidential election year. Second quarter political sales came in higher than expected, thanks in part to primary spending in California. And right now, we're seeing big activity in many of our major market O&Os. 
As always, spending will peak in the fourth quarter, not only at the top of the ticket, but at the gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional races as well, where tickets are not quite as unified as they've been in past elections. 
In radio, we have taken a major step forward in terms of separating this business from CBS with the filing of our S-1. We're also continuing to talk about other potential alternatives. Just like we did with outdoor, our strategy is to maximize the value of this asset while centering our company around the premium content that can best drive our results. 
So across our company, we're executing the strategy that we have laid out for our investors, and we are building on that strategy all the time. As we look ahead, every single opportunity that we evaluate has to fit the same criteria. Does it benefit CBS shareholders? From the investment of capital to the return of capital, to any potential M&A, CBS shareholders are always our priority. The good news is that we have already have the assets and the strategy to deliver on all of our financial objectives. The even better news is that there are new catalysts for growth being hatched all the time. 
The ways we can marry together our premium content with new technologies are growing every day, and we will continue to take advantage of every one of them. 
So it was a terrific quarter. Our business is thriving, and we see growth opportunities ahead that are more exciting than ever. As those opportunities unfold, we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have laid out for you, just as we always do. We are already looking forward to updating you on our next call. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."
27763231,339233060,1017147,"CBS Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Paramount Global","Executives","Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that once again reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in owning more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing",1584,"Thanks, Les, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another terrific quarter that once again reaffirms our overall strategies. We are investing in owning more of our content, which is leading to more revenue opportunities. We are growing our recurring revenue from places like retrans and reverse comp, SVOD, international content licensing and our over-the-top subscription services. 
As a result, we delivered healthy double-digit growth in our key profit measures, even as we continue to invest in our future success. 
On the top line, we had a very strong quarter as well. Total revenue was up 2% at $3.3 billion, although that doesn't tell the entire story. During the second quarter, we were comping against 2 significant events from last year. First, we had the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, which was the highest-grossing sporting event of all time; and second, last year, we had the NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship game on CBS, which, as you know, rotates to us every other year. 
Taken together, these 2 events would have added 6 percentage points of growth to us in the second quarter. So therefore, underlying revenue was extremely healthy for the quarter. 
Now let me give you some more details about our second quarter results. As I just mentioned, we had the NCAA Men's Championship game last year. As a result, advertising revenue for the second quarter came in at $1.55 billion compared with $1.59 billion in 2015. However, underlying network advertising grew 2% during this year's second quarter. And as you've heard, we recently concluded our upfront with strong pricing across all day parts. 
Affiliate and subscription fee revenue was $733 million for the quarter compared with $752 million last year. However, excluding the Mayweather fight, underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenue grew 18%. Retrans and reverse comp was up 44%, and Showtime's affiliate fees were up a solid 5%. 
As you heard, our over-the-top subscription services are also contributing to our growth and continue to track nicely above our expectations. 
Content licensing was up 16% during the second quarter, and we saw strength both domestically and internationally. As an example, the ways we are monetizing Star Trek demonstrate just how we can benefit from a single content franchise again and again. So the opportunities presented by owning premium content continue to be robust. 
Growth in our high-margin revenue streams led to a 14% increase in operating income, which came in at $733 million during the second quarter, and our operating income margin expanded by more than 200 basis points to 22%. 
In addition, net earnings were up 16% to $423 million for the second quarter, and EPS was up 26% to $0.93. Our results on a year-to-date basis were equally impressive. Revenue of $7.1 billion was up 6%, operating income of $1.5 billion was up 15%, and EPS of $1.95 was up 29%. 
Now let's turn to our operating segment. Entertainment revenue in the second quarter came in at $1.95 billion, up 9% with strength across the board. As I mentioned, underlying network advertising grew 2%. Content licensing and distribution was up 19%, thanks in part to our Star Trek deals, and affiliate and subscription fees were up 59%, driven by higher retrans and reverse comp as well as growth at CBS All Access. 
Entertainment operating income of $351 million for the second quarter was up 34% due to the strong gains in our high-margin revenue streams, and our entertainment operating income margin expanded 3 points to 18%. 
At our Cable Network segment, second quarter revenue came in at $536 million, down 13% from last year when we had the big pay-per-view fight, which affected the revenue comparison by 24 points. Underlying cable network revenue grew 11%, primarily due to the licensing of our Showtime brand and original series as well as higher affiliate and subscription fees. 
Second quarter cable operating income of $227 million was up 3%, thanks to increases in our higher-margin revenue streams, which drove operating income growth even as we continue to invest in original programming. And our cable operating income margin expanded 6 points to 42%, and we expect further margin expansion from here as we move into the back half of 2016. 
Turning to Publishing. Second quarter revenue came in at $187 million compared with $199 million last year due to the timing of releases. Best-selling titles for the second quarter included End of Watch by Stephen King and Foreign Agent by Brad Thor. And as Les just mentioned, we have a strong release schedule ahead. 
Publishing operating income for the second quarter of $26 million was up 4% as a result of lower cost. And our Publishing operating income margin expanded more than 100 basis points to 14%. 
In Local Broadcasting, second quarter revenue came in at $647 million compared with $654 million in 2015, with the decline entirely driven by comping against last year's NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game. 
Underlying Local Broadcasting revenue was even with 2015 with TV stations up 1% and radio stations down 1%. 
Looking ahead, we expect political spending to kick in fully during the back half of 2016, with Q4 being the strongest. 
Local Broadcasting operating income for the second quarter was up 7% to $212 million, driven by the restructuring activity we put in place last year. Those actions also resulted in our operating income margin expanding 3 points to a solid 33%. 
Turning to cash flow on our balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion compared with $835 million in 2015, up 41% due to the growth in underlying advertising revenue, higher affiliate and subscription fees and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. 
Also during the first half of 2016, we bought back 19.5 million shares of our stock for $1 billion. As we stated in the past, we expect to complete another $1 billion in share repurchases by year's end. That is consistent with the quarterly pace you saw during the first half of the year or about $500 million per quarter. 
And as you probably saw, we just issued $700 million of new 10-year bonds with a 2.9% coupon, a historic low for us. And we ended the second quarter with $176 million of cash on hand. 
Now let me give you a brief update on the separation of our radio business. As you heard, we filed our S-1 with the SEC a few weeks ago, which is in line with the timeline we laid out for you on our last call. While we move forward with an IPO, we also continue to evaluate all opportunities. No matter what avenue we pursue, we are confident we will unlock significant value, just as we did when we split off Outdoor. We will keep you posted on the developments in the months ahead. 
In addition, in preparation for the planned split off of radio, we will begin to separate our operations of our local TV and radio businesses, so our Q3 financial statements will reflect those changes in our segment reporting, and thus, we will report local TV and radio separately. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see in the back half of the year. We expect a great year for advertising. Year-to-date, underlying network advertising was up 7%, and we anticipate a strong finish to 2016, led by our new upfront pricing as well as the strong marketplace for sports advertising that really begins with the kickoff of the NFL season in September. 
For the third quarter, our TV stations are pacing to be up high single digits, driven by political advertising, and radio is pacing to be up as well. Affiliate and subscription fees continue on their path of steady growth. We are set to surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp by the end of 2016. And next year, we'll have 14% of our reverse comp and 24% of our retrans footprint coming up for renewal, giving us the opportunity to reset those deals to current fair market value. At the same time, our over-the-top service subscription services are growing and becoming a bigger contributor to our results. 
In content licensing and distribution, we see big opportunities ahead from across the company. As you heard, at the CW, we've already concluded a new Netflix deal for in season and out of season content that will take effect in Q3. 
At Showtime, we expect to announce new agreements in the near-term to license our entire brand, just as we've previously done in Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. 
In addition, our Star Trek deals will benefit us again next year by both internationally and on CBS All Access. And at the CBS Television Network, we are launching 6 new shows in the fall, and we have ownership in all of them, leading to even more future content licensing revenue. 
So in summary, our second quarter was very strong, and with the presidential election, healthy gains in the upfront pricing market and a number of new ways to grow our high-margin revenue, the momentum is continuing into the back half of 2016. We continue to execute in the short term, while focusing on our long-term growth strategy. With all the opportunities ahead of us, we are confident as ever about our future. 
And above all, we are fully committed to delivering for our shareholders year in and year out. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

Let me just talk about how you thought about pricing versus volume. And I'll just ask my follow up in over-the-top. The Showtime numbers implied by your disclosure shows some pretty healthy growth. And I think you're kind of pacing along with HBO now, which is better than you would have thought given your distribution on traditional TV. Any color on what's driving the success? Any sort of distribution deals? I know you have a Hulu partnership. And Joe, should we see the revenue growth accelerate at cable on the subscription side as a result of all this success?"

The upfront sort of played out exactly like we would have planned, exactly as we drew up the playbook. All the blocking and tackling worked. If you recall, before the upfront began a few weeks before or a month before, I said we were looking for double-digit pricing. And if that was the case, we would attempt to sell in the high 70s percentage of our inventory, which is exactly what we did. We like holding back a little, about 20%, a little over 20% for scatter because the scatter marketplaces increases to be strong. We saw an incredible scatter through first quarter, second quarter, third -- fourth quarter of last year, and we continue to do this. So as I said, we got double digits, we got the volume we wanted, and as I said, we couldn't have drawn it out any better. We were extremely pleased. It closed quickly, cleanly and in a very positive manner. So let the games begin."

So that continues to plug away. And yes, look, I think, we gave you the math on the revenue, so there's a direct correlation to subs and revenue in the OTT space, and it is our highest margin revenue for obvious reasons. We take the largest share as opposed to our distributors getting a pretty fair take in that. So again, you should expect to see that to impact revenue."

In addition, once again, a lot more of the statistics came out about digital advertising and its effectiveness. And as I said in my remarks during the earnings call, digital advertising works better along with broadcast, and broadcast, when you have a show like NCIS, which has 20 million viewers a week, and Big Bang, which has 20 million a week, it is hard to duplicate that. So when you see scatter pricing like that, I think, advertising agencies say, you know what, even though there's double-digit pricing at the upfront marketplace, I better get on -- in the game here or else I'm going to have to pay a lot more later on. And because of those 2 factors, as I said, this came out where we anticipated it, where we wanted it and it all made sense to us."

Anything to be aware of in terms of what kind of numbers to look for, for TV versus radio? And then, relatedly, over the longer term, would this actually inflate pricing further on your TV assets?"

So if they can't buy -- and this is -- what we do is we'll figure out a way to -- if they want local, maybe we can sell them network.

We obviously market it within the CBS family because we reach 99% of households on a weekly basis. So I mean, that's the benefit we have of who we are and stuff. But they spend their own marketing dollars, their dedicated marketing dollars to them, and so that will continue like any business rollout."

There will eventually be a package where you can get Showtime OTT and CBS All Access together at a potential slight discount. But as of now, these 2 million are not crossed whatsoever. So they're not bundled. Regarding the weekly, I guess, you're referring to that Star Trek is going to be put out 1 episode at a time. We think that's the right way to go in this, and we think that's the better way to go. The Showtime version is the monthly as opposed to launching, in a quarter, 2 shows at the same time. We have spread it out, so that there's a new show, there's a new offering on Showtime once a month or thereabouts all the way. It's not only to help streaming, it's just to help viewership in general.

Thank you very much for joining us today. As you've seen, CBS continues to perform at a very high level, and the future for us just keeps looking better and better.

As you've seen, CBS continues to perform at a very high level, and the future for us just keeps looking better and better. Along these lines, today's results represent another terrific record-breaking quarter. Revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion, operating income was up 6% to $798 million and EPS was up 19% to $1.05, an all-time high, and our 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Everyone of our businesses grew in revenue and profit during the quarter. So we have broad-based strength across our company, and we are well on our way to another record-setting year for CBS Corporation in both revenue and profit. 
Most importantly, we are achieving these results while investing in new growth opportunities all the time. 
So the state of the CBS Corporation is extremely strong, which is more important now than ever given changes in our industry and as we consider a potential recombination with Viacom. 
As you know, our Board has formed a special committee to work with us and explore this possibility, and we are still in the very early stages. So while the timetable and outcome are unclear, our strategy is not. If it looks right and it's structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity. If not, we are very excited about our prospects on our own, and as you can see in our excellent results today. Once again, I'd like to remind you, we will only do a deal if it is in the best interest of CBS and all of its shareholders. Whatever the outcome, CBS has a very bright future ahead. 
Meanwhile, in the broader landscape, we're also seeing the increasing value of premium content, as evidenced by AT&T's proposed agreement to buy Time Warner. Clearly, all distribution always needs great content. And with the #1 network in all of television, we like our positioning in the marketplace. The fact is, all successful bundles, regardless of size or platform, have to have CBS. This is why our retrans and reverse comp revenue was growing so dramatically and is why we're ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in 2016. It's also why we're having successful negotiations with new distributors looking to carry our content over-the-top and through skinny bundles. And these growing revenue figures don't even include the excellent success we're seeing with CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, each of which, as we said, has already passed 1 million subscribers and growing. Once again, no matter how consumers want their content, we will be there, and we are in position to succeed. 
In addition to that, our base business is very healthy. Nationally, advertising accelerating here in the fourth quarter due to the higher out front prancing that kicked in with the new season and a very, very strong scatter market. And locally, political advertising is extraordinarily high with spending like we've never seen before led by down ballot races leading to near record for us at CBS. 
At the same time, advertising is growing. Our non-advertising revenue is growing even faster. In fact, this type of revenue is growing so fast that this quarter, advertising represented just 43% of our overall revenue. That's the lowest percentage we've ever had for any quarter in our history. 
And as we separate our radio business next year, this is a trend that will only continue. Joe will give you more details about the split off of radio in a little bit. But the headline is, that it's on track, and it's allowing us to return more capital to shareholders even sooner than we planned. And of course, when the separation is complete, our company will be even more focused on creating and developing premium content. 
The crown jewel of that content is the CBS Television Network which, as you know, has a long, long track record of success. We've been the #1 network for 13 of the past 14 years, including last year's first place finish across all key demos. And just to clarify, first in all demos with or without football. We followed that up this year by kicking off another outstanding season as the #1 network yet again. We won each of the first 5 weeks of the season before this huge World Series began. Kudos to our friends at Fox for televising a great World Series. Look at the power of network television. 
Going back to the season, we have the 2 most watched shows on television, with Big Bang Theory and NCIS as well as the #1 new drama, Bull, and the #1 new comedy, Kevin Can Wait. So it's no surprise, we remain strong at the CBS Television Network. The best part is we have ownership in all of our new shift series. And thanks to the way we license our content internationally these days, we are already selling these shows in hundreds of markets around the world. In fact, Bull was just licensed in 200 territories, and MacGyver, the #1 new show on Friday, has a similar global footprint. 
And here at home, we are selling our lineup into a robust advertising marketplace. This includes both broadcasting and digital advertising, which continues to work best as a complement to television, not as a replacement. This is a fact we've been saying for a long time, and studies and data continue to support it. So as we do more and more deals where broadcast and digital are sold together, we are pleased that CBS Interactive has just moved up the sixth largest Internet platform in the U.S, it's monthly unique users are only behind the 5 biggest names in all the Internet, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and then the CBS. We are ahead of every single one of our competitors in that area. 
So we're the #1 television network and the top 10 Internet business, we have a powerful combination for advertisers that no other company can match. 
Plus one of the most exciting events underway is that much more digital viewing will soon be counted together with television. By the time we negotiate next year's upfront, we believe Nielsen's new total audience ratings will be a big part of the negotiation. Total audience rating counts audiences across nearly all digital and streaming devices as well as traditional video on demand and DVR usage. This means we can get paid for the full value of the more than 20 million viewers a week we bring in for shows like Big Bang, NCIS and Bull. 
Just as we told you years ago that C3 would evolve into C7, total audience ratings represent another significant step to our getting paid for the audience we are actually delivering. And with viewing habits changing, this will become a very big number. In fact, when all platforms are counted, we have more total viewers watching our shows today than we did 15 years ago. And this year, our new Premiere Week lineup had 6.5% more total viewers than we did last year. 
One of the day parts where we see cross-platform measurement helping the most is in late night, where we continue to have great success. Stephen Colbert just posted its highest weekly ratings in more than a year and he's clearly resonating on television and online during this election season. I mean, he was able to generate millions of views by live streaming kittens watching the vice presidential debate. Next week will be another key moment in this amazing election season for Stephen when he host an election night live special on Showtime and live shows on CBS the nights before and after the election. 
Of course, the James Corden phenomenon continues as well. His brilliant Carpool Karaoke franchise has now been streamed nearly 2 billion times, thanks to the viral success of Carpool as well as James' Drop the Mic segment, we've licensed both of these bits into full shows that have been sold to Apple and CBS, respectively. And like The Late Show and the late show, the shows are being produced by CBS Television Studios, which continues to create content for all networks across all platforms. 
Turning to sports. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about NFL ratings with the bulk of the issues having to do with primetime games. As you know, we do the majority of our business on Sunday afternoon where the ratings are a lot more stable and with this past week, we were up 13%. NFL programming still remains the premier property of all of television, and we look forward to a strong second half of the season, which begins this weekend, followed by the playoffs and the AMC Championship game in Q1. 
At CBS News, our broadcast have thrived during this election season, thanks to our hard news profiles and original reporting. CBS evening news has now had 6 consecutive years of viewer increases and the CBS This Morning is delivering its best audience in nearly 3 decades. And we're #1 on Sunday as well where we recently completed a seamless transition with Jane Pauley stepping into for the retiring Charlie Osgood at CBS Sunday Morning. We're also pleased that during the quarter, CBS News was awarded more Emmys than any competing broadcast or cable outlet. 
And also thanks to our political coverage, our digital news network, CBSN, turned in an all-time high of 60 million streams in the third quarter and the momentum has continued, including another weekly streaming letter during the last presidential debate 2 weeks ago. 
So once again, we're growing our audience by delivering our content in the way that viewers wanted. 
This is also the case at CBS All Access, our subscription streaming service. During the quarter, we launched an ad-free version of all access for $9.99 a month, and we will also launch our first original program with Big Brother Over the Top. 
As a result, CBS All Access continues its steady climb in subscribers with more to come in the first half of next year with a February debut of the Good Fight, the recently titled spin-off of The Good Wife and the May premiere of Star Trek Discovery. This has been an exciting beginning for CBS All Access, and we look forward to growing this new revenue stream for years to come. 
We also have the ambitious goal for Showtime Over the Top as well. Once again, the service allows us to reach are literally tens of millions of homes we couldn't reach before with the old model. 
As a result, we're seeing growth in subscribers with each series we premier, and we expect to continue that trend when we launch new seasons of The Affair at the end of this month, Homeland in January and Billions in February. And of course, 2017 will also bring the long-awaited return of Twin Peaks, with creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and many original cast members returning. Fans can be certain that the new Twin Peaks will be just as provocative and entertaining as the first one. 
In addition, we continue to license our entire Showtime brand internationally. Following deals in Canada, Australia and several key European markets, we have now extended our footprint into Spain through a new agreement with Telefónica. Each time we do a deal like this, we are creating new fans and a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime at better economics than when we simply license individual shows overseas. 
So once again, our investment in original programming continues to pay off in new ways all the time. 
Great content is also driving our success in publishing where we had double-digit top line growth in the quarter, the most recent books from Stephen King and comedian Amy Schumer help drive our sales, but the big splurge came right at the end of September when Simon & Schuster launched what's already becoming the book of the year, Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
This book was an immediate worldwide bestseller, and it continues to fly off the shelves, which bodes very well for us as we enter into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. 
In local, the big story, of course, is political advertising. Despite what you may have heard from others station groups, 2016 will be a record-breaking year for us in terms of political spending. In fact, our total billing for this year's presidential race is on track to be 74% higher than it was 4 years ago. And while the top of the ticket may be getting more attention, it's what's happening at the local level that's really interesting. 
From prop issues in California, where we own 3 duopolies to gubernatorial Senate and House races across the country, candidates are spending more than ever before to make themselves stand out. This includes the hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, where we own stations in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which is at $140 million is already the biggest spend in Senate history. 
So from local to national, from television to mobile, this company continues to have tremendous success. We're posting record results quarter-after-quarter, and we're set up for a record 2016 and even better 2017 and a plan for significant growth right through 2020 and beyond. 
Clearly, there's a lot of talk out there about us and about others. But as you can see from our results this quarter, we continue to perform no matter what the circumstances even and especially in times of great change. 
We are absolutely focused on running our business and building on our track record of success. We are a team you can count on. 
So it's a great time to be an investor in CBS, and that I couldn't be more confident that we have a very exciting and successful future ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. If you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified reven",1814,"Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. If you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified revenue base. It's a strategy we've been working on for years, and this year is a great example. 
Let me explain what I mean. In the first quarter, we had record-setting network advertising revenue. In the second quarter, international content licensing drove our results. In the third quarter, domestic cable licensing led the way. And in the fourth quarter, we expect record local political spending. And to top it off, we've had double-digit increases in retrans and reverse comp as well as our OTT subscription revenue throughout the year. 
So we no longer rely on any single source of revenue which gives us much more visibility and stability in our results now and in the future. And it allows us to reinvest in our businesses on a consistent basis. 
Now let me give you some more details about our third quarter results. As you heard, revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion. In terms of advertising, revenue for this year's third quarter was down slightly from last year due to 10 fewer hours of advertising from political preemptions as well as the impact of the Summer Olympics. Underlying network advertising was up slightly, and local advertising at our TV stations grew strongly, thanks to political spending. 
Content licensing and distribution had a great quarter and grew 6% to $1.1 billion. The increase was driven by broad growth in domestic TV licensing of both our CBS library and our Showtime original series. 
Our content also remains strong internationally. During the quarter, we locked in deals for all of our new CBS and CW primetime series before they even aired here in the U.S. 
And as you heard, we also did a deal in Spain for an entire Showtime brand, similar to the ones we've done in several other foreign territories, making Showtime a premium, global affiliated network. 
And in affiliate and subscription fee revenue in the third quarter, it was up 13% to $753 million. Retrans and reverse comp grew 32% and our over-the-top subscription services CBS All Access and Showtime OTT continue to become a more meaningful contributor to our results each quarter. 
Operating income for the third quarter was up 6% to $798 million, once again, we grew our profit margin even as we continue to invest in more content. We now have ownership in more than 80% of our Showtime and CBS lineups. 
Net earnings for the quarter grew 10% to $467 million and diluted EPS was up 19% to $1.05. 
On a year-to-date basis, our results were equally impressive. Revenue was up 6%, operating income was up 12% and EPS was up 26% September year-to-date to $3 per share. And as you know, the fourth quarter is historically our strongest quarter. And when you consider that for all of 2015, our EPS was $3.31, you can see that we're on track for a phenomenal year at the CBS Corporation. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the third quarter of $1.95 billion was up 1%, driven by growth in retrans and reverse comp as well as CBS All Access. Content licensing was down 3% from last year when we had the first the cycle sale of Elementary, with higher sales of our library content more than offset this impact. 
In addition, as we just mentioned, underlying network advertising was up slightly during the quarter, and year-to-date, it's up over 5%. And entertainment operating income for the third quarter was up 3% to $348 million. 
Cable Networks revenue of $598 million is up 14% for the quarter. The increase was driven by domestic licensing of some of our Showtime original series, led by Penny Dreadful, demonstrating the strong demand for our content across platforms. Continued growth of Showtime OTT also contributed to our results. 
Cable Networks operating income for the third quarter was up 16% to $285 million. And once again,, we grew our operating income even as we continue to invest in more premium content. 
In addition, our Cable Networks' operating income margin for the quarter expanded by 1 point to 48%. As we said in the past, margins for Cable Networks should be looked at on a year-to-date basis. 
And for the first 9 months of 2016, operating income -- our operating income margin expanded 2 points to 45%. 
In publishing, revenue of $226 million was up 11% in the third quarter. As you heard, best-selling titles included The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer and the recently released Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
In addition, audiobooks continue to grow strongly and were up 41% for the quarter and overall digital sales grew 5%. 
Publishing operating income in the third quarter was up 2% to $44 million and our publishing operating income margin came in at a solid 19%. 
Also during the quarter, we separated out what we used to call our Local Broadcasting segment into 2 segments: Local Media, which includes our TV stations and our local digital websites and radio. Now that Local Media is a separate segment, in order to better align our results with our industry peers, we are recording 100% of our retrans revenue in Local Media, which then pays reverse comp to the network. Again, consistent with publicly traded television companies. All of this is reflected in the 8-K that we filed with the SEC last month, where we showed our last 6 quarters on a comparable basis. 
Local Media revenue in the third quarter was up 9% to $409 million, driven by strong political spending at our TV stations that you've just heard about. 
In addition, higher retrans also contributed to our results. Local Media operating income for the third quarter was $122 million, up 21% and our Local Media operating income margin expanded 3 points to 30%. 
In radio, third quarter revenue came in at $319 million, up slightly from last year. Radio operating income was up 5% to $77 million, thanks in part to the restructuring activities we put in place in 2015. 
And the operating income margin for radio expanded 100 basis points to 24%. 
Speaking of radio, let me give you a brief update on how we're progressing with the separation. 
Last month, CBS Radio issued $1.46 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.25%. And we are on track for an IPO in early 2017. 
That said, we may have a small window of opportunity to go even earlier if market conditions are favorable here in Q4. 
Similar to the outdoor playbook of years ago, the next step after the IPO will be an exchange offer sometime in 2017, resulting in more capital returns for CBS shareholders and further focusing our company on our core content businesses. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2016 came in at $1.2 billion, more than double the $546 million in 2015. The increase was driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees, higher advertising revenue and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. So while EPS growth has been strong this year, cash flow growth has been even stronger. 
We also ended the quarter with a gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.68x. 
And as you may recall, in late July, we made a series of announcements. We issued $700 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.9% due in 2027, we increased our dividend by 20% which took effect October 1, and we replenished our share buyback program to $6 billion. 
We also bought back $500 million of our stock in Q3 and here in Q4, we plan to repurchase another $500 million just as we told you we would. 
We are also accelerating our share buyback program and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our stock in Q4 using some of the debt proceeds we received from radio. 
As always, first and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in our businesses, which we have been doing consistently. This includes launching 3 OTT services in CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and CBSN, only more and more of our shows on both CBS and Showtime creating original programming for the summer and producing content for other platforms, just to name a few. 
We are fortunate that through our strong free cash flow generation, our solid investment-grade balance sheet and the benefits of the radio transaction, we are also able to return to this level of capital to our shareholders. 
And as we look ahead to 2017 with our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with the proceeds from the radio IPO and subsequent split off, investors can expect another healthy year of capital returns. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. In local advertising, we expect an extremely strong fourth quarter for Local Media, driven by political spending. Local Media is pacing to be up mid- to high teens, and radio is pacing to be up low single digits. 
And on the national front, we see underlying network advertising strengthening from third quarter levels, driven by our new upfront pricing as well as scatter pricing that is up strong double digits. 
In content licensing, we have ownership in all the new shows that we just launched on the CBS Television Network, and we've already renewed 3 of them for a full season. So we continue to fill the content pipeline with new programming that we can monetize across multiple platforms for years to come. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we will achieve a milestone in the fourth quarter when we surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp revenue for all of 2016. 
And next year, we're set to grow even more with 21% of our retrans and 14% of our reverse comp footprint coming up for renewal. 
So in summary, we turned in another terrific quarter, and we are well on our way to yet another record year. Even more importantly, as we deliver strong results, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy for our future. By creating the best content, we are driving revenue growth from sources like retrans and reverse comp, over-the-top, skinny bundles, international content sales, Dynamic Ad Insertion and more. So we are making solid progress in achieving all the goals we outlined for you at our Investor Day in Q1 of this year. And our results today should give you even more confidence that our revenue opportunities for 2020 are very achievable, and that CBS is well positioned to succeed in the ever changing media landscape. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

But when you count 2 billion streams of Carpool Karaoke and where the pricing is going with streaming, those numbers really turn into something very significant with both clips and full shows that are going on there. It's obviously expanding and, once again, the domestic syndication market, once again, may be slightly down from where it was before but, once again, enhanced. And I'm talking about off network syndication. Enhanced so much by streaming and other SVOD deals that the amount of revenue we are taking in domestically is greatly increased. So ownership of our shows becomes more and more important as we referenced. So when you add in what's happening internationally and domestically, the after life of these shows, the back end becomes more important every day than the front end. So it's good to have a good advertising marketplace, but it's also good to have good programming that we own, and we could cash in on."

So we have some really big title. I think when you hit the nail on the head though, I think what is underappreciated is the Showtime. Part of our strategy from years ago was to own more and more of Showtime. So because Showtime is only 25-ish million homes here, there's a lot of people that don't have the exposure to Showtime.

And by the way, it's certainly beneficial financially for the both of them at us, and we've always sort of insisted that they be included in these deals. And as a result, All Access is growing faster because they share in the revenue, they're pushing it, they appreciate it, and it makes so much better period meetings in the and I expect our competitors having it. Regarding the marketing, it's a very good issue and something that we deal with on our OTT platforms. Once again, we are planning in the next few months to announce the ability to sell both of them together. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Selling them together we haven't come to price point together, that once again, that ties into marketing as we head into the spring and have Star Trek and Twin Peaks coming out on those competing platforms how great will it be looking forward to be able to market them together at a slight discount if you buy them both. But that's part of our intent. The more people are exposed to these platforms, the more they like them, the more we're doing original content on them, the more they like them. So once again, having a direct relationship with our consumer is a really important thing, owning the CBS Television Network allows us to directly to promote to them, and we have a lot of exciting marketing plans for both of them as we go forward."

Moving to your next question, look, Carpool Karaoke exploded out of nowhere as did Drop the Mic that's quite that extent. What we do and as we look at the universe and the universe has changed greatly, where everything's first call is not necessarily the CBS. A show like Carpool Karaoke works much better on Apple iTunes it's going to be promoted by them it is not a show that really fits per se with CBS, it fit s better there. The same thing with Drop the Mic perhaps better on Turner. The Star Trek obviously, we could have sold the Netflix, we could have sold it Amazon. Showtime would have loved to have it. The CBS television network will love to have it. We have a wealth of opportunity, but once again, I think you've told people how important All Access was to us. I think our goal of getting 4 million subs by 2020 is greatly enhanced by the knowledge that we're taking the family jewels in a really special property that has millions of huge fans for Star Trek and putting it on CBS All Access will help give that a great boost. So once again, I love having the ability to program everything from the Showtime down to syndication game shows, soap operas, great shows on CBS. And what's happening with our production group is we are now selling, I think we have shows no with 13 other venues outside of the CBS family, and is going to be important growth opportunity for us as we look down the future."

As you've seen, CBS continues to perform at a very high level, and the future for us just keeps looking better and better. Along these lines, today's results represent another terrific record-breaking quarter. Revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion, operating income was up 6% to $798 million and EPS was up 19% to $1.05, an all-time high, and our 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Everyone of our businesses grew in revenue and profit during the quarter. So we have broad-based strength across our company, and we are well on our way to another record-setting year for CBS Corporation in both revenue and profit. 
Most importantly, we are achieving these results while investing in new growth opportunities all the time. 
So the state of the CBS Corporation is extremely strong, which is more important now than ever given changes in our industry and as we consider a potential recombination with Viacom. 
As you know, our board has formed a special committee to work with us and explore this possibility, and we are still in the very early stages. So while the timetable and outcome are unclear, our strategy is not. If it looks right and it's structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity. If not, we are very excited about our prospects on our own, and as you can see in our excellent results today. Once again, I'd like to remind you, we will only do a deal if it is in the best interest of CBS and all of its shareholders. Whatever the outcome, CBS has a very bright future ahead. 
Meanwhile, in the broader landscape, we're also seeing the increasing value of premium content, as evidenced by AT&T's proposed agreement to buy Time Warner. Clearly, all distribution always needs great content. And with the #1 network in all of television, we like our positioning in the marketplace. The fact is, all successful bundles, regardless of size or platform, have to have CBS. This is why our retrans and reverse comp revenue was growing so dramatically and is why we're ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in 2016. It's also why we're having successful negotiations with new distributors looking to carry our content over-the-top and through skinny bundles. And these growing revenue figures don't even include the excellent success we're seeing with CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, each of which, as we said, has already passed 1 million subscribers and growing. Once again, no matter how consumers want their content, we will be there, and we are in position to succeed. 
In addition to that, our base business is very healthy. Nationally, advertising accelerating here in the fourth quarter due to the higher out front prancing that kicked in with the new season and a very, very strong scatter market. And locally, political advertising is extraordinarily high with spending like we've never seen before led by down ballot races leading to near record for us at CBS. 
At the same time, advertising is growing. Our non-advertising revenue is growing even faster. In fact, this type of revenue is growing so fast that this quarter, advertising represented just 43% of our overall revenue. That's the lowest percentage we've ever had for any quarter in our history. 
And as we separate our radio business next year, this is a trend that will only continue. Joe will give you more details about the split off of radio in a little bit. But the headline is, that it's on track, and it's allowing us to return more capital to shareholders even sooner than we planned. And of course, when the separation is complete, our company will be even more focused on creating and developing premium content. 
The crown jewel of that content is the CBS Television Network which, as you know, has a long, long track record of success. We've been the #1 network for 13 of the past 14 years, including last year's first place finish across all key demos. And just to clarify, first in all demos with or without football. We followed that up this year by kicking off another outstanding season as the #1 network yet again. We won each of the first 5 weeks of the season before this huge World Series began. Kudos to our friends at Fox for televising a great World Series. Look at the power of network television. 
Going back to the season, we have the 2 most watched shows on television, with Big Bang Theory and NCIS as well as the #1 new drama, Bull, and the #1 new comedy, Kevin Can Wait. So it's no surprise, we remain strong at the CBS Television Network. The best part is we have ownership in all of our new shift series. And thanks to the way we license our content internationally these days, we are already selling these shows in hundreds of markets around the world. In fact, Bull was just licensed in 200 territories, and MacGyver, the #1 new show on Friday, has a similar global footprint. 
And here at home, we are selling our lineup into a robust advertising marketplace. This includes both broadcasting and digital advertising, which continues to work best as a complement to television, not as a replacement. This is a fact we've been saying for a long time, and studies and data continue to support it. So as we do more and more deals where broadcast and digital are sold together, we are pleased that CBS Interactive has just moved up the sixth largest Internet platform in the U.S, it's monthly unique users are only behind the 5 biggest names in all the Internet, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and then the CBS. We are ahead of every single one of our competitors in that area.
So we're the #1 television network and the top 10 Internet business, we have a powerful combination for advertisers that no other company can match. 
Plus one of the most exciting events that's underway is that much more digital viewing will soon be counted together with television. By the time we negotiate next year's upfront, we believe Nielsen's new total audience ratings will be a big part of the negotiation. Total audience rating counts audiences across nearly all digital and streaming devices as well as traditional video on demand and DVR usage. This means we can get paid for the full value of the more than 20 million viewers a week we bring in for shows like Big Bang, NCIS and Bull.
Just as we told you years ago that C3 would evolve into C7, total audience ratings represent another significant step toward getting pace of the audience we are actually delivering. And with viewing habits changing, this will become a very big number. In fact, when all platforms are counted, we have more total viewers watching our shows today than we did 15 years ago. And this year, our new Premiere Week lineup had 6.5% more total viewers than we did last year. 
One of the day parts where we see cross-platform measurement helping the most is in late night, where we continue to have great success. Stephen Colbert just posted its highest weekly ratings in more than a year, and he's clearly resonating on television and online during this election season. I mean, he was able to generate millions of views by live streaming kittens watching the vice presidential debate. Next week will be another key moment in this amazing election season for Stephen when he host an election night live special on Showtime and live shows on CBS the nights before and after the election.
Of course, the James Corden phenomenon continues as well. His brilliant Carpool Karaoke franchise has now been streamed nearly 2 billion times, thanks to the viral success of Carpool as well as James' Drop the Mic segment, we've licensed both of these bits into full shows that have been sold to Apple and CBS, respectively. And like The Late Late Show and The Late Show, these shows are being produced by CBS Television Studios, which continues to create content for all networks across all platforms. 
Turning to sports. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk about NFL ratings with the bulk of the issues having to do with primetime games. As you know, we do the majority of our business on Sunday afternoon where the ratings are a lot more stable and with this past week, we were up 13%. NFL programming still remains the premier property of all of television, and we look forward to a strong second half of the season, which begins this weekend, followed by the playoffs and the AMC Championship game in Q1. 
At CBS News, our broadcast have thrived during this election season, thanks to our hard news profiles and original reporting. CBS Evening News has now had 6 consecutive years of viewer increases and the CBS This Morning is delivering its best audiences nearly 3 decades. And we're #1 on Sunday as well where we recently completed a seamless transition with Jane Pauley stepping in for the retiring Charlie Osgood at CBS Sunday Morning. We're also pleased that during the quarter, CBS News was awarded more Emmys than any competing broadcast or cable outlet. 
And also thanks to our political coverage, our digital news network, CBSN, turned in an all-time high of 60 million streams in the third quarter and the momentum has continued, including another weekly streaming letter during the last presidential debate 2 weeks ago. 
So once again, we're growing our audience by delivering our content in the way that viewers wanted. 
This is also the case at CBS All Access, our subscription streaming service. During the quarter, we launched an ad-free version of all access for $9.99 a month, and we we've also launched our first original program with Big Brother Over the Top. 
As a result, CBS All Access continues its steady climb in subscribers with more to come in the first half of next year with a February debut of the Good Fight, the recently titled spin-off of The Good Wife and the May premiere of Star Trek Discovery. This has been an exciting beginning for CBS All Access, and we look forward to growing this new revenue stream for years to come. 
We also have ambitious goal for Showtime Over the Top as well. Once again, this service allows us to reach literally tens of millions of homes we couldn't reach before with the old model. 
As a result, we're seeing growth in subscribers with each series we premier, and we expect to continue that trend when we launch new seasons of The Affair at the end of this month, Homeland in January and Billions in February. And of course, 2017 will also bring the long-awaited return of Twin Peaks, with creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and many original cast members returning. Fans can be certain that the new Twin Peaks will be just as provocative and entertaining as the first one. 
In addition, we continue to license our entire Showtime brand internationally. Following deals in Canada, Australia and several key European markets, we have now extended our footprint into Spain through a new agreement with Telefónica. Each time we do a deal like this, we are creating new fans and a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime at better economics than when we simply licensed individual shows overseas. 
So once again, our investment in original programming continues to pay off in new ways all the time. 
Great content is also driving our success in publishing where we had double-digit top line growth in the quarter, the most recent books from Stephen King and comedian Amy Schumer help drive our sales, but the big splurge came right at the end of September when Simon & Schuster launched what's already becoming the book of the year, Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen.
This book was an immediate worldwide bestseller, and it continues to fly off the shelves, which bodes very well for us as we enter into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. 
In local, the big story, of course, is political advertising. Despite what you may have heard from others station groups, 2016 will be a record-breaking year for us in terms of political spending. In fact, our total billing for this year's presidential race is on track to be 74% higher than it was 4 years ago. And while the top of the ticket may be getting more attention, it's what's happening at the local level that's really interesting. 
From prop issues in California, where we own 3 duopolies to gubernatorial Senate and House races across the country, candidates are spending more than ever before to make themselves stand out. This includes the hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, where we own stations in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which is at $140 million is already the biggest spend in Senate history.
So from local to national, from television to mobile, this company continues to have tremendous success. We're posting record results quarter-after-quarter, and we're set up for a record 2016 and even better 2017 and a plan for significant growth right through 2020 and beyond.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk out there about us and about others. But as you can see from our results this quarter, we continue to perform no matter what the circumstances even and especially in times of great change. 
We are absolutely focused on running our business and building on our track record of success. We are a team you can count on. 
So it's a great time to be an investor in CBS, and that I couldn't be more confident that we have a very exciting and successful future ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. Now if you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified r",1814,"Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. Now if you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified revenue base. It's a strategy we've been working on for years, and this year is a great example. 
Let me explain what I mean. In the first quarter, we had record-setting network advertising revenue. In the second quarter, international content licensing drove our results. In the third quarter, domestic cable licensing led the way. And in the fourth quarter, we expect record local political spending. And to top it off, we've had double-digit increases in retrans and reverse comp as well as our OTT subscription revenue throughout the year. 
So we no longer rely on any single source of revenue which gives us much more visibility and stability in our results now and in the future. And it allows us to reinvest in our businesses on a consistent basis. 
Now let me give you some more details about our third quarter results. As you heard, revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion. In terms of advertising, revenue for this year's third quarter was down slightly from last year due to 10 fewer hours of advertising from political preemptions as well as the impact of the Summer Olympics. Underlying network advertising was up slightly, and local advertising at our TV stations grew strongly, thanks to political spending. 
Content licensing and distribution had a great quarter and grew 6% to $1.1 billion. The increase was driven by broad growth in domestic TV licensing of both our CBS library and our Showtime original series. 
Our content also remains strong internationally. During the quarter, we locked in deals for all of our new CBS and CW primetime series before they even aired here in the U.S. 
And as you heard, we also did a deal in Spain for an entire Showtime brand, similar to the ones we've done in several other foreign territories, making Showtime a premium, global affiliated network. 
And in affiliate and subscription fee revenue in the third quarter, it was up 13% to $753 million. Retrans and reverse comp grew 32% and our over-the-top subscription services CBS All Access and Showtime OTT continue to become a more meaningful contributor to our results each quarter.
Operating income for the third quarter was up 6% to $798 million, once again, we grew our profit margin even as we continue to invest in more content. We now have ownership in more than 80% of our Showtime and CBS lineups.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 10% to $467 million and diluted EPS was up 19% to $1.05. 
On a year-to-date basis, our results were equally impressive. Revenue was up 6%, operating income was up 12% and EPS was up 26% September year-to-date to $3 per share. And as you know, the fourth quarter is historically our strongest quarter. And when you consider that for all of 2015, our EPS was $3.31, you can see that we're on track for a phenomenal year at the CBS Corporation. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the third quarter of $1.95 billion was up 1%, driven by growth in retrans and reverse comp as well as CBS All Access. Content licensing was down 3% from last year when we had the first cycle sale of Elementary, with higher sales of our library content more than offset this impact. 
In addition, as we just mentioned, underlying network advertising was up slightly during the quarter, and year-to-date, it's up over 5%. And entertainment operating income for the third quarter was up 3% to $348 million. 
Cable Networks revenue of $598 million is up 14% for the quarter. The increase was driven by domestic licensing of some of our Showtime original series, led by Penny Dreadful, demonstrating the strong demand for our content across platforms. Continued growth of Showtime OTT also contributed to our results. 
Cable Networks operating income for the third quarter was up 16% to $285 million. And once again,, we grew our operating income even as we continue to invest in more premium content. 
In addition, our Cable Networks' operating income margin for the quarter expanded by 1 point to 48%. As we said in the past, margins for Cable Networks should be looked at on a year-to-date basis. 
And for the first 9 months of 2016, operating income -- our operating income margin expanded 2 points to 45%. 
In publishing, revenue of $226 million was up 11% in the third quarter. As you heard, best-selling titles included The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer and the recently released Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
In addition, audiobooks continue to grow strongly and were up 41% for the quarter and overall digital sales grew 5%. 
Publishing operating income in the third quarter was up 2% to $44 million and our publishing operating income margin came in at a solid 19%. 
Also during the quarter, we separated out what we used to call our Local Broadcasting segment into 2 segments: Local Media, which includes our TV stations and our local digital websites; and radio. Now that Local Media is a separate segment, in order to better align our results with our industry peers, we are recording 100% of our retrans revenue in Local Media, which then pays reverse comp to the network. Again, consistent with publicly traded television companies. All of this is reflected in an 8-K that we filed with the SEC last month, where we showed our last 6 quarters on a comparable basis. 
Local Media revenue in the third quarter was up 9% to $409 million, driven by strong political spending at our TV stations that you've just heard about. 
In addition, higher retrans also contributed to our results. Local Media operating income for the third quarter was $122 million, up 21% and our Local Media operating income margin expanded 3 points to 30%. 
In radio, third quarter revenue came in at $319 million, up slightly from last year. Radio operating income was up 5% to $77 million, thanks in part to the restructuring activities we put in place in 2015. 
And the operating income margin for radio expanded 100 basis points to 24%. 
Speaking of radio, let me give you a brief update on how we're progressing with the separation. 
Last month, CBS Radio issued $1.46 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.25%. And we are on track for an IPO in early 2017. 
That said, we may have a small window of opportunity to go even earlier if market conditions are favorable here in Q4. 
Similar to the outdoor playbook a few years ago, the next step after the IPO will be an exchange offer sometime in 2017, resulting in more capital returns for CBS shareholders and further focusing our company on our core content businesses. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2016 came in at $1.2 billion, more than double the $546 million in 2015. The increase was driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees, higher advertising revenue and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. So while EPS growth has been strong this year, cash flow growth has been even stronger. 
We also ended the quarter with a gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.68x. 
And as you may recall, in late July, we made a series of announcements. We issued $700 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.9% due in 2027, we increased our dividend by 20% which took effect October 1, and we replenished our share buyback program to $6 billion. 
We also bought back $500 million of our stock in Q3 and here in Q4, we plan to repurchase another $500 million just as we told you we would. 
We are also accelerating our share buyback program and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our stock in Q4 using some of the debt proceeds we received from radio. 
As always, first and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in our businesses, which we have been doing consistently. This includes launching 3 OTT services in CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and CBSN, only more and more of our shows on both CBS and Showtime creating original programming for the summer and producing content for other platforms, just to name a few. 
We are fortunate that through our strong free cash flow generation, our solid investment-grade balance sheet and the benefits of the radio transaction, we are also able to return this level of capital to our shareholders. 
And as we look ahead to 2017 with our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with the proceeds from the radio IPO and subsequent split off, investors can expect another healthy year of capital returns. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. In local advertising, we expect an extremely strong fourth quarter for Local Media, driven by political spending. Local Media is pacing to be up mid- to high teens, and radio is pacing to be up low single digits. 
And on the national front, we see underlying network advertising strengthening from third quarter levels, driven by our new upfront pricing as well as scatter pricing that is up strong double digits. 
In content licensing, we have ownership in all the new shows that we just launched on the CBS Television Network, and we've already renewed 3 of them for a full season. So we continue to fill the content pipeline with new programming that we can monetize across multiple platforms for years to come. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we will achieve a milestone in the fourth quarter when we surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp revenue for all of 2016. 
And next year, we're set to grow even more with 21% of our retrans and 14% of our reverse comp footprint coming up for renewal. 
So in summary, we turned in another terrific quarter, and we are well on our way to yet another record year. Even more importantly, as we deliver strong results, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy for our future. By creating the best content, we are driving revenue growth from sources like retrans and reverse comp, over-the-top, skinny bundles, international content sales, Dynamic Ad Insertion and more. So we are making solid progress in achieving all the goals we outlined for you at our Investor Day in Q1 of this year. And our results today should give you even more confidence that our revenue opportunities for 2020 are very achievable, and that CBS is well positioned to succeed in the ever changing media landscape. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

So",305,"Marci, regarding the affiliates, they've always been an important part of our fabric and who are. We've always had a great deal of respect for them and having their cooperation throughout time, helping us promote our shows. They're part of the family. So as we enter into the new era, we have always found it really important and beneficial. And by the way, in certain ways, beneficial financially for the both them and us, and we've always sort of insisted that they be included in these deals. And as a result, All Access has grown faster because they share in the revenue, they're pushing it, they appreciate it, and it makes for much better affiliate meetings in May than I expect our competitors having it. Regarding the marketing, it's a very good issue and something that we deal with on our OTT platforms. Once again, we are planning in the next few months to announce the ability to sell both of them together. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Selling them together, we haven't come to a price point together, but once again, that ties into marketing. As we head into the spring and have Star Trek and Twin Peaks coming out on those competing platforms, how great will it be looking forward to be able to market them together at a slight discount if you buy them both. But that's part of our intent. The more people are exposed to these platforms, the more they like them. The more we're doing original content on them, the more they like them. So once again, having a direct relationship with our consumer is a really important thing. Owning the CBS Television Network allows us to directly promote to them, and we have a lot of exciting marketing plans for both of them as we go forward."

If you're not 1 or 2 in your segment, you're out, sell it, divest it, let Joe go to town, making -- maximizing the return on capital. And then my second question -- that's sort of a programming question. My second question is also programming. I think it's really interesting that you've taken James Corden and you're developing a series for Apple, and you're taking Drop the Mic and developing a series for TBS. Could you just share sort of your programming philosophy with those entities and why not put them on CBS All Access? Or how do you think about Star Trek is going on CBS All Access, but these other 2, you're going to develop for a third party that sort of competes with you at some level?"

That's pure conjecture, and I'm not talking about -- all I'm talking about is CBS and Showtime, a little bit CW, a little bit top, a little bit CBS Sports Network. Those are the only channels that I am dealing with and I'm worrying about programming right now. And moving to your next question, look, Carpool Karaoke exploded out of nowhere, as did Drop the Mic, not quite to that extent. What we do and as we look at the universe, and the universe has changed greatly, where everything's first call is not necessarily to CBS, a show like Carpool Karaoke works much better on Apple iTunes. It's going to be promoted by them. And it's not a show that really fits per se with CBS, it fits better there. And the same thing with Drop the Mic, perhaps better on Turner. Star Trek, obviously, we could have sold to Netflix, we could have sold it Amazon. Showtime would have loved to have it. The CBS Television Network would love to have it. We had a wealth of opportunity, but once again, I think you've told people how important All Access was to us. I think our goal of getting 4 million subs by 2020 is greatly enhanced by the knowledge that we're taking the family jewels in a really special property that has millions of huge fans for Star Trek, and putting it on CBS All Access will help give that a great boost. So once again, I love having the ability to program everything from the Showtime down to syndication, game shows, soap operas, great shows on CBS. And what's happening with our production group is we are now selling. I think we have shows now with 13 other venues outside of the CBS family, and that is going to be an important growth opportunity for us as we look down the future."

As you've seen, CBS continues to perform at a very high level, and the future for us just keeps looking better and better. Along these lines, today's results represent another terrific record-breaking quarter. Revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion, operating income was up 6% to $798 million and EPS was up 19% to $1.05, an all-time high, and our 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Every one of our businesses grew in revenue and profit during the quarter. So we have broad-based strength across our company, and we are well on our way to another record-setting year at the CBS Corporation in both revenue and profit. 
Most importantly, we are achieving these results while investing in new growth opportunities all the time. 
So the state of the CBS Corporation is extremely strong, which is more important now than ever given changes in our industry and as we consider a potential recombination with Viacom. 
As you know, our board has formed a special committee to work with us and explore this possibility, and we are still in the very early stages. So while the timetable and outcome are unclear, our strategy is not. If it looks right and it is structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity. If not, we are very excited about our prospects on our own, and as you can see in our excellent results today. Once again, I'd like to remind you, we will only do a deal if it is in the best interests of CBS and all of its shareholders. Whatever the outcome, CBS has a very bright future ahead. 
Meanwhile, in the broader landscape, we're also seeing the increasing value of premium content, as evidenced by AT&T's proposed agreement to buy Time Warner. Clearly, all distribution always needs great content. And with the #1 network in all of television, we like our positioning in the marketplace. The fact is, all successful bundles, regardless of size or platform, have to have CBS. This is why our retrans and reverse comp revenue has growing so dramatically and is why we're ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in 2016. It's also why we're having successful negotiations with new distributors looking to carry our content over-the-top and through skinny bundles. And these growing revenue figures don't even include the excellent success we're seeing with CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, each of which, as we said, has already passed 1 million subscribers and growing. Once again, no matter how consumers want their content, we will be there, and we are in position to succeed. 
In addition to that, our base business is very healthy. Nationally, advertising is accelerating here in the fourth quarter due to the higher up-front pricing that kicked in with the new season and a very, very strong scatter market. And locally, political advertising is extraordinarily high, with spending like we've never seen before, led by down ballot races, leading to new records for us at CBS. 
At the same time, advertising is growing. Our non-advertising revenue is growing even faster. In fact, this type of revenue is growing so fast that, this quarter, advertising represented just 43% of our overall revenue. That's the lowest percentage we've ever had for any quarter in our history. 
And as we separate our radio business next year, this is a trend that will only continue. Joe will give you more details about the split off of radio in a little bit. But the headline is, that it's on track, and it's allowing us to return more capital to shareholders even sooner than we'd planned. And of course, when the separation is complete, our company will be even more focused on creating and developing premium content. 
The crown jewel of that content is the CBS Television Network which, as you know, has a long, long track record of success. We've been the #1 network for 13 of the past 14 years, including last year's first place finish across all key demos. And just to clarify, first in all demos with or without football. We followed that up this year by kicking off another outstanding season as the #1 network yet again. We won each of the first 5 weeks of the season before this huge World Series began. Kudos to our friends at Fox for televising a great World Series. Look at the power of network television. 
Going back to the season, we have the 2 most watched shows on television, with Big Bang Theory and NCIS as well as the #1 new drama, Bull, and the #1 new comedy, Kevin Can Wait. So it's no surprise, we remain strong at the CBS Television Network. The best part is we have ownership in all of our new series. And thanks to the way we license our content internationally these days, we are already selling these shows in hundreds of markets around the world. In fact, Bull was just licensed in 200 territories, and MacGyver, the #1 new show on Friday, has a similar global footprint. 
And here at home, we are selling our lineup into a robust advertising marketplace. This includes both broadcasting and digital advertising, which continues to work best as a complement to television, not as a replacement. This is a fact we've been saying for a long time, and studies and data continue to support it. So as we do more and more deals where broadcast and digital are sold together, we are pleased that CBS Interactive has just moved up to the sixth largest Internet platform in the U.S. It's monthly unique users are only behind the 5 biggest names in all the Internet: Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and then CBS. We are ahead of every single one of our competitors in that area.
So with the #1 television network and a top 10 Internet business, we have a powerful combination for advertisers that no other company can match. 
Plus, one of the most exciting advancements underway is that much more digital viewing will soon be counted together with television. By the time we negotiate next year's upfront, we believe Nielsen's new total audience ratings will be a big part of the negotiations. Total audience ratings counts audiences across nearly all digital and streaming devices as well as traditional video-on-demand and DVR usage. This means we can get paid for the full value of the more than 20 million viewers a week we bring in for shows like Big Bang, NCIS and Bull.
Just as we told you years ago that C3 would evolve into C7, total audience ratings represents another significant step toward getting paid for the audience we are actually delivering. And with viewing habits changing, this will become a very big number. In fact, when all platforms are counted, we have more total viewers watching our shows today than we did 15 years ago. And this year, our new Premiere Week lineup had 6.5% more total viewers than we did last year. 
One of the day parts where we see cross-platform measurement helping the most is in late night, where we continue to have great success. Stephen Colbert just posted his highest weekly ratings in more than a year, and he's clearly resonating on television and online during this election season. I mean, he was able to generate millions of views by live streaming kittens watching the vice presidential debate. Next week will be another key moment in this amazing election season for Stephen when he hosts an election night live special on Showtime and live shows on CBS the nights before and after the election.
Of course, the James Corden phenomenon continues as well. His brilliant Carpool Karaoke franchise has now been streamed nearly 2 billion times, thanks to the viral success of Carpool as well as James' Drop the Mic segment, we've licensed both of these bits into full shows that have been sold to Apple and TBS, respectively. And like The Late Late Show and The Late Show, these shows are being produced by CBS Television Studios, which continues to create content for all networks across all platforms. 
Turning to sports. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk about NFL ratings with the bulk of the issues having to do with primetime games. As you know, we do the majority of our business on Sunday afternoon where the ratings are a lot more stable and with this past week, we were up 13%. NFL programming still remains the premier property of all of television, and we look forward to a strong second half of the season, which begins this weekend, followed by the playoffs and the AFC Championship game in Q1. 
At CBS News, our broadcasts have thrived during this election season, thanks to our hard news profile and original reporting. CBS Evening News has now had 6 consecutive years of viewer increases and CBS This Morning is delivering its best audience in nearly 3 decades. And we're #1 on Sunday as well where we recently completed a seamless transition with Jane Pauley stepping in for the retiring Charlie Osgood at CBS Sunday Morning. We're also pleased that during the quarter, CBS News was awarded more Emmys than any competing broadcast or cable outlet. 
And also thanks to our political coverage, our digital news network, CBSN, turned in an all-time high of 60 million streams in the third quarter and the momentum has continued, including another weekly streaming letter during the last presidential debate 2 weeks ago. 
So once again, we're growing our audience by delivering our content in the way that viewers want it. 
This is also the case at CBS All Access, our subscription streaming service. During the quarter, we launched an ad-free version of all access for $9.99 a month, and we also launched our first original program with Big Brother: Over the Top. 
As a result, CBS All Access continues its steady climb in subscribers with more to come in the first half of next year with the February debut of the Good Fight, the recently titled spin-off of The Good Wife and the May premiere of Star Trek Discovery. This has been an exciting beginning for CBS All Access, and we look forward to growing this new revenue stream for years to come. 
We also have ambitious goal for Showtime Over the Top as well. Once again, this service allows us to reach literally tens of millions of homes we couldn't reach before with the old model. 
As a result, we're seeing growth in subscribers with each series we premier, and we expect to continue that trend when we launch new seasons of The Affair at the end of this month, Homeland in January and Billions in February. And of course, 2017 will also bring the long-awaited return of Twin Peaks, with creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and many original cast members returning. Fans can be certain that the new Twin Peaks will be just as provocative and entertaining as the first one. 
In addition, we continue to license our entire Showtime brand internationally. Following deals in Canada, Australia and several key European markets, we have now extended our footprint into Spain through a new agreement with Telefónica. Each time we do a deal like this, we are creating new fans and a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime at better economics than when we simply license individual shows overseas. 
So once again, our investment in original programming continues to pay off in new ways all the time. 
Great content is also driving our success in publishing where we had double-digit top line growth in the quarter. The most recent books from Stephen King and comedian Amy Schumer helped drive our sales, but the big splurge came right at the end of September when Simon & Schuster launched, what is already becoming the book of the year, Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen.
This book was an immediate worldwide bestseller, and it continues to fly off the shelves, which bodes very well for us as we enter into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. 
In local, the big story, of course, is political advertising. Despite what you may have heard from others station groups, 2016 will be a record-breaking year for us in terms of political spending. In fact, our total billing for this year's presidential race is on track to be 74% higher than it was 4 years ago. And while the top of the ticket may be getting more attention, it's what's happening at the local level that's really interesting. 
From prop issues in California, where we own 3 duopolies, to gubernatorial, Senate and House races across the country, candidates are spending more than ever before to make themselves stand out. This includes the hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, where we own stations in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which is at $140 million, is already the biggest spend in Senate history.
So from local to national, from television to mobile, this company continues to have tremendous success. We're posting record results quarter-after-quarter, and we're set up for a record 2016, an even better 2017 and a plan for significant growth right through 2020 and beyond.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk out there about us and about others. But as you can see from our results this quarter, we continue to perform no matter what the circumstances even, and especially, in times of great change. 
We are absolutely focused on running our business and building on our track record of success. We are a team you can count on. 
So it's a great time to be an investor in CBS, and I couldn't be more confident that we have a very exciting and successful future ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. Now if you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified revenue base. It's a strategy we've been working on for years, and this year is a great example. 
Let me explain what I mean. In the first quarter, we had record-setting network advertising revenue. In the second quarter, international content licensing drove our results. In the third quarter, domestic cable licensing led the way. And in the fourth quarter, we expect record local political spending. And to top it off, we've had double-digit increases in retrans and reverse comp as well as our OTT subscription revenue throughout the year. 
So we no longer rely on any single source of revenue which gives us much more visibility and stability in our results now and in the future. And it allows us to reinvest in our businesses on a consistent basis. 
Now let me give you some more details about our third quarter results. As you heard, revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion. In terms of advertising, revenue for this year's third quarter was down slightly from last year due to 10 fewer hours of advertising from political preemptions as well as the impact of the Summer Olympics. Underlying network advertising was up slightly, and local advertising at our TV stations grew strongly, thanks to political spending. 
Content licensing and distribution had a great quarter and grew 6% to $1.1 billion. The increase was driven by broad growth in domestic TV licensing of both our CBS library and our Showtime original series. 
Our content also remains strong internationally. During the quarter, we locked in deals for all of our new CBS and CW prime time series before they even aired here in the U.S. 
And as you heard, we also did a deal in Spain for an entire Showtime brand, similar to the ones we've done in several other foreign territories, making Showtime a premium, global affiliated network. 
And in affiliate and subscription fee revenue in the third quarter, it was up 13% to $753 million. Retrans and reverse comp grew 32% and our over-the-top subscription services, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, continue to become a more meaningful contributor to our results each quarter.
Operating income for the third quarter was up 6% to $798 million, once again, we grew our profit margin even as we continued to invest in more content. We now have ownership in more than 80% of our Showtime and CBS lineups.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 10% to $467 million and diluted EPS was up 19% to $1.05. 
On a year-to-date basis, our results were equally impressive. Revenue was up 6%, operating income was up 12% and EPS was up 26%, September year-to-date, to $3 per share. And as you know, the fourth quarter is historically our strongest quarter. And when you consider that for all of 2015, our EPS was $3.31, you can see that we're on track for a phenomenal year at the CBS Corporation. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the third quarter of $1.95 billion was up 1%, driven by growth in retrans and reverse comp as well as CBS All Access. Content licensing was down 3% from last year when we had the first cycle sale of Elementary, but higher sales of our library content more than offset this impact. 
In addition, as we just mentioned, underlying network advertising was up slightly during the quarter, and year-to-date, it's up over 5%. And entertainment operating income for the third quarter was up 3% to $348 million. 
Cable Networks revenue of $598 million was up 14% for the quarter. The increase was driven by domestic licensing of some of our Showtime original series, led by Penny Dreadful, demonstrating the strong demand for our content across platforms. Continued growth of Showtime OTT also contributed to our results. 
Cable Networks operating income for the third quarter was up 16% to $285 million. And once again, we grew our operating income even as we continued to invest in more premium content. 
In addition, our Cable Networks' operating income margin for the quarter expanded by 1 point to 48%. As we've said in the past, margins for Cable Networks should be looked at on a year-to-date basis. 
And for the first 9 months of 2016, operating income -- our operating income margin expanded 2 points to 45%. 
In publishing, revenue of $226 million was up 11% in the third quarter. As you heard, best-selling titles included The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer and the recently released Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
In addition, audiobooks continue to grow strongly and were up 41% for the quarter and overall digital sales grew 5%. 
Publishing operating income in the third quarter was up 2% to $44 million and our publishing operating income margin came in at a solid 19%. 
Also during the quarter, we separated out what we used to call our Local Broadcasting segment into 2 segments: Local Media, which includes our TV stations and our local digital websites; and radio. Now that Local Media is a separate segment, in order to better align our results with our industry peers, we are recording 100% of our retrans revenue in Local Media, which then pays reverse comp to the network. Again, consistent with publicly traded television station companies. All of this is reflected in an 8-K that we filed with the SEC last month, where we showed our last 6 quarters on a comparable basis. 
Local Media revenue in the third quarter was up 9% to $409 million, driven by strong political spending at our TV stations that you've just heard about. 
In addition, higher retrans also contributed to our results. Local Media operating income for the third quarter was $122 million, up 21% and our Local Media operating income margin expanded 3 points to 30%. 
In radio, third quarter revenue came in at $319 million, up slightly from last year. Radio operating income was up 5% to $77 million, thanks in part to the restructuring activities we put in place in 2015. 
And the operating income margin for radio expanded 100 basis points to 24%. 
Speaking of radio, let me give you a brief update on how we're progressing with the separation. 
Last month, CBS Radio issued $1.46 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.25%. And we are on track for an IPO in early 2017. 
That said, we may have a small window of opportunity to go even earlier if market conditions are favorable here in Q4. 
Similar to the outdoor playbook a few years ago, the next step after the IPO will be an exchange offer sometime in 2017, resulting in more capital returns for CBS shareholders and further focusing our company on our core content businesses. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2016 came in at $1.2 billion, more than double the $546 million in 2015. The increase was driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees, higher advertising revenue and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. So while EPS growth has been strong this year, cash flow growth has been even stronger. 
We also ended the quarter with a gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.68x. 
And as you may recall, in late July, we made a series of announcements. We issued $700 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.9% due in 2027, we increased our dividend by 20% which took effect October 1, and we replenished our share buyback program to $6 billion. 
We also bought back $500 million of our stock in Q3 and here in Q4, we plan to repurchase another $500 million just as we told you we would. 
We are also accelerating our share buyback program and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our stock in Q4 using some of the debt proceeds we received from radio. 
As always, first and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in our businesses, which we have been doing consistently. This includes launching 3 OTT services in CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and CBSN, owning more and more of our shows on both CBS and Showtime creating original programming for the summer and producing content for other platforms, just to name a few. 
We are fortunate that through our strong free cash flow generation, our solid investment-grade balance sheet and the benefits of the radio transaction, we are also able to return this level of capital to our shareholders. 
And as we look ahead to 2017 with our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with the proceeds from the radio IPO and subsequent split off, investors can expect another healthy year of capital returns. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. In local advertising, we expect an extremely strong fourth quarter for Local Media, driven by political spending. Local Media is pacing to be up mid- to high teens, and radio is pacing to be up low single digits. 
And on the national front, we see underlying network advertising strengthening from third quarter levels, driven by our new upfront pricing as well as scatter pricing that is up strong double digits. 
In content licensing, we have ownership in all the new shows that we just launched on the CBS Television Network, and we've already renewed 3 of them for a full season. So we continue to fill the content pipeline with new programming that we can monetize across multiple platforms for years to come. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we will achieve a milestone in the fourth quarter when we surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp revenue for all of 2016. 
And next year, we're set to grow even more with 21% of our retrans and 14% of our reverse comp footprint coming up for renewal. 
So in summary, we turned in another terrific quarter, and we are well on our way to yet another record year. Even more importantly, as we deliver strong results, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy for our future. By creating the best content, we are driving revenue growth from sources like retrans and reverse comp, over-the-top, skinny bundles, international content sales, Dynamic Ad Insertion and more. So we are making solid progress in achieving all the goals we outlined for you at our Investor Day in Q1 of this year. And our results today should give you even more confidence that our revenue opportunities for 2020 are very achievable, and that CBS is well positioned to succeed in the ever changing media landscape. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

Is there anything you would point out in terms of any CBS strategy shift on the programming side or shift in competitors' strategy that drove the share that you've gotten so far this season for CBS? I know it's early, but perhaps there's something to tease out there. And then one of the really interesting dynamics around the launch of virtual MVPDs is the ability for content owners to more aggressively monetize in-season stacking rights. So I'm just curious how broadly you've sold your in-season stacking rights to both the traditional MVPDs, and do you see that opportunity with the virtual MVPDs?"

Once again, it's good to be the leader of the pack again. And Fox certainly was helped by 7 days of great World Series ratings. Damn them, but good for them. And it's all very healthy.

So we have some really big titles. I think what -- you hit the nail on the head though, I think what's underappreciated is the Showtime. Part of our strategy from years ago was to own more and more of Showtime. So because Showtime is only in 25-ish million homes here, there's a lot of people that don't have the exposure to Showtime. So I think monetizing that and unlocking that because we own that intellectual property, it's huge amounts of cash flows for years to come."

We've always had a great deal of respect for them and having their cooperation throughout time, helping us promote our shows. They're part of the family. So as we enter into the new era, we have always found it really important and beneficial. And by the way, in certain ways, beneficial financially for both them and us, and we've always sort of insisted that they be included in these deals. And as a result, All Access has grown faster because they share in the revenue, they're pushing it, they appreciate it, and it makes for much better affiliate meetings in May than I expect our competitors having it. Regarding the marketing, it's a very good issue and something that we deal with on our OTT platforms. Once again, we are planning in the next few months to announce the ability to sell both of them together. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Selling them together, we haven't come to a price point together, but once again, that ties into marketing. As we head into the spring and have Star Trek and Twin Peaks coming out on those competing platforms, how great will it be looking forward to be able to market them together at a slight discount if you buy them both. But that's part of our intent. The more people are exposed to these platforms, the more they like them. The more we're doing original content on them, the more they like them. So once again, having a direct relationship with our consumer is a really important thing. Owning the CBS Television Network allows us to directly promote to them, and we have a lot of exciting marketing plans for both of them as we go forward."

If you're not 1 or 2 in your segment, you're out, sell it, divest it, let Joe go to town, making -- maximizing the return on capital. And then my second question -- that's sort of a programming question. My second question is also programming. I think it's really interesting that you've taken James Corden and you're developing a series for Apple, and you're taking Drop the Mic and developing a series for TBS. Could you just share sort of your programming philosophy with those entities? Why not put them on CBS All Access? Or how do you think about Star Trek is going on CBS All Access, but these other 2, you're going to develop for a third party that sort of competes with you at some level?"

The philosophical question, with all due respect, I cannot answer. That's pure conjecture, and I'm not talking about -- all I'm talking about is CBS and Showtime, a little bit CW, a little bit POP, a little bit CBS Sports Network. Those are the only channels that I am dealing with and I'm worrying about programming right now. And moving to your next question, look, Carpool Karaoke exploded out of nowhere, as did Drop the Mic, not quite to that extent. What we do and as we look at the universe, and the universe has changed greatly, where everything's first call is not necessarily to CBS, a show like Carpool Karaoke works much better on Apple iTunes. It's going to be promoted by them. And it's not a show that really fits per se with CBS, it fits better there. The same thing with Drop the Mic, perhaps better on Turner. Star Trek, obviously, we could have sold to Netflix, we could have sold it to Amazon. Showtime would have loved to have it. The CBS Television Network would have loved to have it. We had a wealth of opportunity, but once again, I think you've told people how important All Access was to us. I think our goal of getting 4 million subs by 2020 is greatly enhanced by the knowledge that we're taking the family jewels and a really special property that has millions of huge fans for Star Trek, and putting it on CBS All Access will help give that a great boost. So once again, I love having the ability to program everything from the Showtime down to syndication, game shows, soap operas, great shows on CBS. And what's happening with our production group is we are now selling. I think we have shows now with 13 other venues outside of the CBS family, and that's going to be an important growth opportunity for us as we look down the future."

As you've seen, CBS continues to perform at a very high level, and the future for us just keeps looking better and better. Along these lines, today's results represent another terrific record-breaking quarter. Revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion, operating income was up 6% to $798 million and EPS was up 19% to $1.05, an all-time high, and our 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. 
Every one of our businesses grew in revenue and profit during the quarter. So we have broad-based strength across our company, and we are well on our way to another record-setting year at the CBS Corporation in both revenue and profit. 
Most importantly, we are achieving these results while investing in new growth opportunities all the time. 
So the state of the CBS Corporation is extremely strong, which is more important now than ever given changes in our industry and as we consider a potential recombination with Viacom. 
As you know, our board has formed a special committee to work with us and explore this possibility, and we are still in the very early stages. So while the timetable and outcome are unclear, our strategy is not. If it looks right and it is structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity. If not, we are very excited about our prospects on our own, and as you can see in our excellent results today. Once again, I'd like to remind you, we will only do a deal if it is in the best interests of CBS and all of its shareholders. Whatever the outcome, CBS has a very bright future ahead. 
Meanwhile, in the broader landscape, we're also seeing the increasing value of premium content, as evidenced by AT&T's proposed agreement to buy Time Warner. Clearly, all distribution always needs great content. And with the #1 network in all of television, we like our positioning in the marketplace. The fact is, all successful bundles, regardless of size or platform, have to have CBS. This is why our retrans and reverse comp revenue has growing so dramatically and is why we're ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in 2016. It's also why we're having successful negotiations with new distributors looking to carry our content over-the-top and through skinny bundles. And these growing revenue figures don't even include the excellent success we're seeing with CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, each of which, as we said, has already passed 1 million subscribers and growing. Once again, no matter how consumers want their content, we will be there, and we are in position to succeed. 
In addition to that, our base business is very healthy. Nationally, advertising is accelerating here in the fourth quarter due to the higher up-front pricing that kicked in with the new season and a very, very strong scatter market. And locally, political advertising is extraordinarily high, with spending like we've never seen before, led by down ballot races, leading to new records for us at CBS. 
At the same time, advertising is growing. Our non-advertising revenue is growing even faster. In fact, this type of revenue is growing so fast that, this quarter, advertising represented just 43% of our overall revenue. That's the lowest percentage we've ever had for any quarter in our history. 
And as we separate our radio business next year, this is a trend that will only continue. Joe will give you more details about the split off of radio in a little bit. But the headline is, that it's on track, and it's allowing us to return more capital to shareholders even sooner than we'd planned. And of course, when the separation is complete, our company will be even more focused on creating and developing premium content. 
The crown jewel of that content is the CBS Television Network which, as you know, has a long, long track record of success. We've been the #1 network for 13 of the past 14 years, including last year's first place finish across all key demos. And just to clarify, first in all demos with or without football. We followed that up this year by kicking off another outstanding season as the #1 network yet again. We won each of the first 5 weeks of the season before this huge World Series began. Kudos to our friends at Fox for televising a great World Series. Look at the power of network television. 
Going back to the season, we have the 2 most watched shows on television, with Big Bang Theory and NCIS as well as the #1 new drama, Bull, and the #1 new comedy, Kevin Can Wait. So it's no surprise, we remain strong at the CBS Television Network. The best part is we have ownership in all of our new series. And thanks to the way we license our content internationally these days, we are already selling these shows in hundreds of markets around the world. In fact, Bull was just licensed in 200 territories, and MacGyver, the #1 new show on Friday, has a similar global footprint. 
And here at home, we are selling our lineup into a robust advertising marketplace. This includes both broadcasting and digital advertising, which continues to work best as a complement to television, not as a replacement. This is a fact we've been saying for a long time, and studies and data continue to support it. So as we do more and more deals where broadcast and digital are sold together, we are pleased that CBS Interactive has just moved up to the sixth largest Internet platform in the U.S. It's monthly unique users are only behind the 5 biggest names in all the Internet: Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and then CBS. We are ahead of every single one of our competitors in that area.
So with the #1 television network and a top 10 Internet business, we have a powerful combination for advertisers that no other company can match. 
Plus, one of the most exciting advancements underway is that much more digital viewing will soon be counted together with television. By the time we negotiate next year's upfront, we believe Nielsen's new total audience ratings will be a big part of the negotiations. Total audience ratings counts audiences across nearly all digital and streaming devices as well as traditional video-on-demand and DVR usage. This means we can get paid for the full value of the more than 20 million viewers a week we bring in for shows like Big Bang, NCIS and Bull.
Just as we told you years ago that C3 would evolve into C7, total audience ratings represents another significant step toward getting paid for the audience we are actually delivering. And with viewing habits changing, this will become a very big number. In fact, when all platforms are counted, we have more total viewers watching our shows today than we did 15 years ago. And this year, our new Premiere Week lineup had 6.5% more total viewers than we did last year. 
One of the day parts where we see cross-platform measurement helping the most is in late night, where we continue to have great success. Stephen Colbert just posted his highest weekly ratings in more than a year, and he's clearly resonating on television and online during this election season. I mean, he was able to generate millions of views by live streaming kittens watching the vice presidential debate. Next week will be another key moment in this amazing election season for Stephen when he hosts an election night live special on Showtime and live shows on CBS the nights before and after the election.
Of course, the James Corden phenomenon continues as well. His brilliant Carpool Karaoke franchise has now been streamed nearly 2 billion times, thanks to the viral success of Carpool as well as James' Drop the Mic segment, we've licensed both of these bits into full shows that have been sold to Apple and TBS, respectively. And like The Late Late Show and The Late Show, these shows are being produced by CBS Television Studios, which continues to create content for all networks across all platforms. 
Turning to sports. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk about NFL ratings with the bulk of the issues having to do with primetime games. As you know, we do the majority of our business on Sunday afternoon where the ratings are a lot more stable and with this past week, we were up 13%. NFL programming still remains the premier property of all of television, and we look forward to a strong second half of the season, which begins this weekend, followed by the playoffs and the AFC Championship game in Q1. 
At CBS News, our broadcasts have thrived during this election season, thanks to our hard news profile and original reporting. CBS Evening News has now had 6 consecutive years of viewer increases and CBS This Morning is delivering its best audience in nearly 3 decades. And we're #1 on Sunday as well where we recently completed a seamless transition with Jane Pauley stepping in for the retiring Charlie Osgood at CBS Sunday Morning. We're also pleased that during the quarter, CBS News was awarded more Emmys than any competing broadcast or cable outlet. 
And also thanks to our political coverage, our digital news network, CBSN, turned in an all-time high of 60 million streams in the third quarter and the momentum has continued, including another weekly streaming letter during the last presidential debate 2 weeks ago. 
So once again, we're growing our audience by delivering our content in the way that viewers want it. 
This is also the case at CBS All Access, our subscription streaming service. During the quarter, we launched an ad-free version of all access for $9.99 a month, and we also launched our first original program with Big Brother: Over the Top. 
As a result, CBS All Access continues its steady climb in subscribers with more to come in the first half of next year with the February debut of the Good Fight, the recently titled spin-off of The Good Wife and the May premiere of Star Trek Discovery. This has been an exciting beginning for CBS All Access, and we look forward to growing this new revenue stream for years to come. 
We also have ambitious goal for Showtime Over the Top as well. Once again, this service allows us to reach literally tens of millions of homes we couldn't reach before with the old model. 
As a result, we're seeing growth in subscribers with each series we premier, and we expect to continue that trend when we launch new seasons of The Affair at the end of this month, Homeland in January and Billions in February. And of course, 2017 will also bring the long-awaited return of Twin Peaks, with creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and many original cast members returning. Fans can be certain that the new Twin Peaks will be just as provocative and entertaining as the first one. 
In addition, we continue to license our entire Showtime brand internationally. Following deals in Canada, Australia and several key European markets, we have now extended our footprint into Spain through a new agreement with Telefónica. Each time we do a deal like this, we are creating new fans and a growing base of recurring revenue for Showtime at better economics than when we simply license individual shows overseas. 
So once again, our investment in original programming continues to pay off in new ways all the time. 
Great content is also driving our success in publishing where we had double-digit top line growth in the quarter. The most recent books from Stephen King and comedian Amy Schumer helped drive our sales, but the big splurge came right at the end of September when Simon & Schuster launched, what is already becoming the book of the year, Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen.
This book was an immediate worldwide bestseller, and it continues to fly off the shelves, which bodes very well for us as we enter into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. 
In local, the big story, of course, is political advertising. Despite what you may have heard from others station groups, 2016 will be a record-breaking year for us in terms of political spending. In fact, our total billing for this year's presidential race is on track to be 74% higher than it was 4 years ago. And while the top of the ticket may be getting more attention, it's what's happening at the local level that's really interesting. 
From prop issues in California, where we own 3 duopolies, to gubernatorial, Senate and House races across the country, candidates are spending more than ever before to make themselves stand out. This includes the hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, where we own stations in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which is at $140 million, is already the biggest spend in Senate history.
So from local to national, from television to mobile, this company continues to have tremendous success. We're posting record results quarter-after-quarter, and we're set up for a record 2016, an even better 2017 and a plan for significant growth right through 2020 and beyond.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk out there about us and about others. But as you can see from our results this quarter, we continue to perform no matter what the circumstances even, and especially, in times of great change. 
We are absolutely focused on running our business and building on our track record of success. We are a team you can count on. 
So it's a great time to be an investor in CBS, and I couldn't be more confident that we have a very exciting and successful future ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. Now if you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified r",1816,"Thanks, Les. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard, we turned in another outstanding quarter. Now if you step back and look at the big picture, you'll see that we're really transforming our company's business model to one that has a strong, diversified revenue base. It's a strategy we've been working on for years, and this year is a great example. 
Let me explain what I mean. In the first quarter, we had record-setting network advertising revenue. In the second quarter, international content licensing drove our results. In the third quarter, domestic cable licensing led the way. And in the fourth quarter, we expect record local political spending. And to top it off, we've had double-digit increases in retrans and reverse comp as well as our OTT subscription revenue throughout the year. 
So we no longer rely on any single source of revenue which gives us much more visibility and stability in our results now and in the future. And it allows us to reinvest in our businesses on a consistent basis. 
Now let me give you some more details about our third quarter results. As you heard, revenue was up 4% to $3.4 billion. In terms of advertising, revenue for this year's third quarter was down slightly from last year due to 10 fewer hours of advertising from political preemptions as well as the impact of the Summer Olympics. Underlying network advertising was up slightly, and local advertising at our TV stations grew strongly, thanks to political spending. 
Content licensing and distribution had a great quarter and grew 6% to $1.1 billion. The increase was driven by broad growth in domestic TV licensing of both our CBS library and our Showtime original series. 
Our content also remains strong internationally. During the quarter, we locked in deals for all of our new CBS and CW prime time series before they even aired here in the U.S. 
And as you heard, we also did a deal in Spain for an entire Showtime brand, similar to the ones we've done in several other foreign territories, making Showtime a premium, global affiliated network. 
And in affiliate and subscription fee revenue in the third quarter, it was up 13% to $753 million. Retrans and reverse comp grew 32% and our over-the-top subscription services, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, continue to become a more meaningful contributor to our results each quarter.
Operating income for the third quarter was up 6% to $798 million, once again, we grew our profit margin even as we continued to invest in more content. We now have ownership in more than 80% of our Showtime and CBS lineups.
Net earnings for the quarter grew 10% to $467 million and diluted EPS was up 19% to $1.05. 
On a year-to-date basis, our results were equally impressive. Revenue was up 6%, operating income was up 12% and EPS was up 26%, September year-to-date, to $3 per share. And as you know, the fourth quarter is historically our strongest quarter. And when you consider that for all of 2015, our EPS was $3.31, you can see that we're on track for a phenomenal year at the CBS Corporation. 
Now let's turn to our operating segments. Entertainment revenue for the third quarter of $1.95 billion was up 1%, driven by growth in retrans and reverse comp as well as CBS All Access. Content licensing was down 3% from last year when we had the first cycle sale of Elementary, but higher sales of our library content more than offset this impact. 
In addition, as we just mentioned, underlying network advertising was up slightly during the quarter, and year-to-date, it's up over 5%. And entertainment operating income for the third quarter was up 3% to $348 million. 
Cable Networks revenue of $598 million was up 14% for the quarter. The increase was driven by domestic licensing of some of our Showtime original series, led by Penny Dreadful, demonstrating the strong demand for our content across platforms. Continued growth of Showtime OTT also contributed to our results. 
Cable Networks operating income for the third quarter was up 16% to $285 million. And once again, we grew our operating income even as we continued to invest in more premium content. 
In addition, our Cable Networks' operating income margin for the quarter expanded by 1 point to 48%. As we've said in the past, margins for Cable Networks should be looked at on a year-to-date basis. 
And for the first 9 months of 2016, operating income -- our operating income margin expanded 2 points to 45%. 
In publishing, revenue of $226 million was up 11% in the third quarter. As you heard, best-selling titles included The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer and the recently released Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
In addition, audiobooks continue to grow strongly and were up 41% for the quarter and overall digital sales grew 5%. 
Publishing operating income in the third quarter was up 2% to $44 million and our publishing operating income margin came in at a solid 19%. 
Also during the quarter, we separated out what we used to call our Local Broadcasting segment into 2 segments: Local Media, which includes our TV stations and our local digital websites; and radio. Now that Local Media is a separate segment, in order to better align our results with our industry peers, we are recording 100% of our retrans revenue in Local Media, which then pays reverse comp to the network. Again, consistent with publicly traded television station companies. All of this is reflected in an 8-K that we filed with the SEC last month, where we showed our last 6 quarters on a comparable basis. 
Local Media revenue in the third quarter was up 9% to $409 million, driven by strong political spending at our TV stations that you've just heard about. 
In addition, higher retrans also contributed to our results. Local Media operating income for the third quarter was $122 million, up 21% and our Local Media operating income margin expanded 3 points to 30%. 
In radio, third quarter revenue came in at $319 million, up slightly from last year. Radio operating income was up 5% to $77 million, thanks in part to the restructuring activities we put in place in 2015. 
And the operating income margin for radio expanded 100 basis points to 24%. 
Speaking of radio, let me give you a brief update on how we're progressing with the separation. 
Last month, CBS Radio issued $1.46 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.25%. And we are on track for an IPO in early 2017. 
That said, we may have a small window of opportunity to go even earlier if market conditions are favorable here in Q4. 
Similar to the outdoor playbook a few years ago, the next step after the IPO will be an exchange offer sometime in 2017, resulting in more capital returns for CBS shareholders and further focusing our company on our core content businesses. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2016 came in at $1.2 billion, more than double the $546 million in 2015. The increase was driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees, higher advertising revenue and our first quarter broadcast of the Super Bowl. So while EPS growth has been strong this year, cash flow growth has been even stronger. 
We also ended the quarter with a gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.68x. 
And as you may recall, in late July, we made a series of announcements. We issued $700 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.9% due in 2027, we increased our dividend by 20% which took effect October 1, and we replenished our share buyback program to $6 billion. 
We also bought back $500 million of our stock in Q3 and here in Q4, we plan to repurchase another $500 million just as we told you we would. 
We are also accelerating our share buyback program and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our stock in Q4 using some of the debt proceeds we received from radio. 
As always, first and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in our businesses, which we have been doing consistently. This includes launching 3 OTT services in CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and CBSN, owning more and more of our shows on both CBS and Showtime creating original programming for the summer and producing content for other platforms, just to name a few. 
We are fortunate that through our strong free cash flow generation, our solid investment-grade balance sheet and the benefits of the radio transaction, we are also able to return this level of capital to our shareholders. 
And as we look ahead to 2017 with our ongoing share repurchase program, coupled with the proceeds from the radio IPO and subsequent split off, investors can expect another healthy year of capital returns. 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what we see ahead. In local advertising, we expect an extremely strong fourth quarter for Local Media, driven by political spending. Local Media is pacing to be up mid- to high teens, and radio is pacing to be up low single digits. 
And on the national front, we see underlying network advertising strengthening from third quarter levels, driven by our new upfront pricing as well as scatter pricing that is up strong double digits. 
In content licensing, we have ownership in all the new shows that we just launched on the CBS Television Network, and we've already renewed 3 of them for a full season. So we continue to fill the content pipeline with new programming that we can monetize across multiple platforms for years to come. 
In affiliate and subscription fees, we will achieve a milestone in the fourth quarter when we surpass $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp revenue for all of 2016. 
And next year, we're set to grow even more with 21% of our retrans and 14% of our reverse comp footprint coming up for renewal. 
So in summary, we turned in another terrific quarter, and we are well on our way to yet another record year. Even more importantly, as we deliver strong results, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy for our future. By creating the best content, we are driving revenue growth from sources like retrans and reverse comp, over-the-top, skinny bundles, international content sales, Dynamic Ad Insertion and more. So we are making solid progress in achieving all the goals we outlined for you at our Investor Day in Q1 of this year. And our results today should give you even more confidence that our revenue opportunities for 2020 are very achievable, and that CBS is well positioned to succeed in the ever changing media landscape. 
And with that, Noah, let's open the line for questions."

So it's a real growth area. Once again, we separate. You look at the ratings of Corden, I'll use that as another example, the ratings are okay. It loses to Seth Meyers. But when you count 2 billion streams of Carpool Karaoke and where the pricing is going with streaming, those numbers really turn into something very significant, with both clips and full shows that are going on there. It's obviously expanding. And once again, the domestic syndication market, once again, may be slightly down from where it was before but, once again, enhanced, and I'm talking about off-network syndication, enhanced so much by streaming and other SVOD deals, that the amount of revenue we are taking in domestically is greatly increased. So ownership of our shows becomes more and more important as we referenced. So when you add in what's happening internationally and domestically, the afterlife of these shows, the back end, becomes more important every day than the front end.

So we have some really big titles. I think what -- you hit the nail on the head though, I think what's underappreciated is the Showtime. Part of our strategy from years ago was to own more and more of Showtime. So because Showtime is only in 25-ish million homes here, there's a lot of people that don't have the exposure to Showtime.

And by the way, in certain ways, beneficial financially for both them and us, and we've always sort of insisted that they be included in these deals. And as a result, All Access has grown faster because they share in the revenue, they're pushing it, they appreciate it, and it makes for much better affiliate meetings in May than I expect our competitors having it. Regarding the marketing, it's a very good issue and something that we deal with on our OTT platforms. Once again, we are planning in the next few months to announce the ability to sell both of them together. CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Selling them together, we haven't come to a price point together, but once again, that ties into marketing. As we head into the spring and have Star Trek and Twin Peaks coming out on those competing platforms, how great will it be looking forward to be able to market them together at a slight discount if you buy them both. But that's part of our intent. The more people are exposed to these platforms, the more they like them. The more we're doing original content on them, the more they like them. So once again, having a direct relationship with our consumer is a really important thing. Owning the CBS Television Network allows us to directly promote to them, and we have a lot of exciting marketing plans for both of them as we go forward."

And then my second question -- that's sort of a programming question. My second question is also programming. I think it's really interesting that you've taken James Corden and you're developing a series for Apple, and you're taking Drop the Mic and developing a series for TBS. Could you just share sort of your programming philosophy with those entities? Why not put them on CBS All Access?

Those are the only channels that I am dealing with and I'm worrying about programming right now. And moving to your next question, look, Carpool Karaoke exploded out of nowhere, as did Drop the Mic, not quite to that extent. What we do and as we look at the universe, and the universe has changed greatly, where everything's first call is not necessarily to CBS, a show like Carpool Karaoke works much better on Apple iTunes. It's going to be promoted by them. And it's not a show that really fits per se with CBS, it fits better there. The same thing with Drop the Mic, perhaps better on Turner. Star Trek, obviously, we could have sold to Netflix, we could have sold it to Amazon. Showtime would have loved to have it. The CBS Television Network would have loved to have it. We had a wealth of opportunity, but once again, I think you've told people how important All Access was to us. I think our goal of getting 4 million subs by 2020 is greatly enhanced by the knowledge that we're taking the family jewels and a really special property that has millions of huge fans for Star Trek, and putting it on CBS All Access will help give that a great boost. So once again, I love having the ability to program everything from the Showtime down to syndication, game shows, soap operas, great shows on CBS. And what's happening with our production group is we are now selling. I think we have shows now with 13 other venues outside of the CBS family, and that's going to be an important growth opportunity for us as we look down the future."
