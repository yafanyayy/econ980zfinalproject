AMETEK delivered solid operational results in the quarter to complete another strong year. We achieved a record level of operating income, operating margins and diluted earnings per share in 2015 despite a very challenging global macroenvironment. Looking ahead, we expect these difficult conditions to persist in 2016, therefore we have taken additional realignment actions in the fourth quarter to help minimize the effects of the ongoing global softness. This realignment costs totaled $20.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share, and we expect annualized savings of approximately $35 million as a result of these actions with an approximate $20 million benefit in 2016. Before covering the financial results, please note that any references to 2014 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015 and the Zygo integration costs in 2014. 
Now on to the fourth quarter and full year results. In the fourth quarter, sales were $988 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were down 4%. Acquisitions added 3% and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. Operating income in the quarter was $229.5 million, down 1% versus 2014's comparable quarter. Operating income margin for the first quarter was very strong at 23.2%, a 50-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $150.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were flat with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, sales were $4 billion, down 1% versus 2014. Operating income was a record $944.3 million, up 3% from 2014 and full year 2015 operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 23.8%. Diluted earnings per share were up 5% over 2014, ending the year at $2.55 per diluted share, a record level. Now turning to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $628.4 million, down 2% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was down 2%, while the Surface Vision acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. So the growth in our Aerospace and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses was more than offset by weakness in our upstream oil and gas business as a result of the continued slump in oil prices. EIG's operating income increased 2% to $170.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 27.2% in the quarter, a 110-basis-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter. The electromechanical group managed well through a very difficult market environment. Sales were $359.6 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's comparable quarter with organic sales down 8%. The acquisition of Global Tubes contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation and our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses as well as soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. EMG's operating income of $70.9 million was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter, down 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. 
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. In 2015, we acquired 2 businesses, Global Tubes and Surface Vision. We deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired roughly $180 million in sales on these 2 acquisitions. 2016 is off to a solid start as we announced today the acquisitions of 2 additional businesses, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales. 
First, I will touch on Brookfield. Brookfield Engineering Laboratories is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. Brookfield provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as the instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum type products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. Brookfield is headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India. The company has annual sales of about $55 million. 
Now let me touch on ESP/SurgeX. They are a leader in Power protection. Their patented protected products operate at the level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing Power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Power business, provided on -- providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. They are headquartered in Knightdale, North Carolina, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million. Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 8 businesses, deployed over $1.1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $510 million in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us throughout the year as we see the strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value especially in low growth environments. Acquisitions will also continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities, which gives us ample liquidity to continue this strategy. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We continue to invest in development expansion of our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. Our Ultra Precision Technologies division continues to see great results from their global expansion investments with midteens organic sales growth across Asia in the fourth quarter. Their Taylor Hobson business delivered excellent growth in China and India in the quarter following recent investments to expand our sales and service infrastructure in these 2 key markets. Also, their Creaform business continues to see great growth internationally with double-digit growth in Asia in the quarter. This growth is being driven by continued development of their sales network across Asia and from strong expansion in the quality control market driven by a number of the recent new product introductions. 
Now moving on to New Products. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing New Products to serve their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets and applications. We have consistently invested in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers. As reflected in our vitality Index, we continue to see as the results from these efforts. Revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 26% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% in last year's fourth quarter. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or about 5% of sales. We are excited about some recent new product introductions. Our GMC business, the leader in precision vibration isolation systems, recently introduced the ever still K400, a compact vibration cancellation system. The ever still is ideal for small vibration sensitive instruments such as optical microscopes, scanning probe microscopes and metrology instruments. Its patented vibration cancellation technology is especially suited for the 1 to 10 hertz vibration range where precision instruments tend to be the most sensitive. The portable ever still is ideal for bench tops and work tables as it requires only a standard AC power outlet. The Lead 5000, the latest generation of atom probe microscopes from our CAMECA business, was recognized by R&D Magazine with an R&D 100 Award. Widely recognized as the Oscars of innovation, the R&D 100 Award is presently presented annually to the 100 most significant new developments in research and development as determined by independent panel of judges. This product was recognized as a breakthrough instrument which unique capabilities have enabled and generates and scientists to gain new insight into materials and processes. Lastly, AMETEK Power instruments recently added an IEC version of their Gemstar 2 electricity revenue meter for use outside North America. The Gemstar 2 is the most accurate revenue meter on the market with the broadest communication options and features the industry's first color graphic display. The meter is specifically designed for applications with the high electric usage such as utility generation and transmission substations. 
I will now touch on Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. In slow growth environment, the success of our operational excellence initiatives takes on an even greater importance as we are able to drive meaningful margin expansion while continuing to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, we realized approximately $150 million in savings in 2015 through our various use Operational Excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to the savings was our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we recognized approximately $75 million in savings for all of 2015. For 2016, we expect approximately $120 million in total savings through our Operational Excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2016. We do not anticipate a meaningful change in global economic conditions in 2016. We expect sluggish conditions across oil and gas, emerging markets and the broad industrial markets to continue. As a result, we anticipate 2016 revenue to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015, with organic growth down low single-digits for all of AMETEK. Earnings for this year are expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share, probably focused more on the lower end of that range, and that's flat to up 4% over 2015. First quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single-digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings in the first quarter to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share versus $0.63 in last year's first quarter. 
So in summary, our overall business performed well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2015. We delivered record operating results in 2015 despite persistent global economic weakness. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to continue to invest in our businesses and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our strong portfolio of businesses and commitment to driving success to our 4 growth strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent long-term growth. 
Before turning the call over to Bob Mandos to cover the financial details, I want to note that Bob has decided to retire effective May 15 of this year. Bob has done a tremendous job over his 35 years of service with AMETEK, and he will be greatly missed. I want to thank Bob for all his contributions to AMETEK and wish him all the best in his retirement. Bill Burke, who many of you know, will be assuming the CFO role on May 15. Bill has also done a superb job for AMETEK over his 28-year career and is well-suited for his new role. Now, Bob, if you could cover the financial details, please."

As Frank noted, we had a good fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down roughly in line with sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% sales. Other expense in the quarter was up approximately $6.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an insurance gain at last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus last year's fourth quarter rate of 27.1%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19% of sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter level. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $69 million for the full year. Full year 2015 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter and $150 million for the full year. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million and free cash flow was $176 million, representing 128% of net income. Excluding the $50 million contribution to our U.S.-defined-benefit pension plan in the first quarter, full year 2015 operating cash flow was $723 million and full year free cash flow was $654 million or 111% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2015, we expanded $360 million on acquisitions. And thus far in 2016, we had deployed approximately $300 million on acquisitions. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $130 million. Total debt was $1.94 billion at December 31, up approximately $230 million from 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $381 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 32.4%. At December 31, we had approximately $930 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong 2015. We are well positioned with the strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

We see significant synergy with these businesses, if I look at the ESP deal, their margins are quite good. However, we can offer significant amounts of synergy in terms of international expansion. They don't do a lot outside the United States. And also just on normal Operational Excellence initiatives can definitely create value. Our goals and how we price these deals, we look for a 10% return on invested capital in year 3. Both of these deals actually exceed that, so we're pretty confident of getting a good return for our shareholders. Following up on Brookfield, Brookfield is just a phenomenal company. Their name is well, well known in the industry, and it's almost synonymous with rheometers because they basically have a very, very strong position in that market. And their margins are lower than the AMETEK margins. So we believe over time, we can definitely put our operational excellence capabilities in place there and move those margins up to the AMETEK average and possibly beyond. So pretty excited about both of these deals. Obviously, doing deals is the primary use of our cash flow, and we're going to continue to make acquisitions throughout the year, and we think it's a very significant value creator for our shareholders."

Now in terms of how that affects the profitability, we passed the commodity prices through so that there's not a major impact from the viewpoint that the prices came down from that perspective. The issue is that because the prices were coming down and so rapidly, our customers basically stopped purchasing. They wanted to make darn sure they were purchasing at the bottom instead of at a different higher level. So the impact here was therefore on the sales line from the viewpoint that they essentially stopped buying, and that is continuing into Q1. We expect some stabilization in Q2. And probably I'm pretty sure bet would be by Q3 that those -- that will stabilize because in essence, those customers need the product. I mean, that's the fundamental issue. So they'll drive their inventories down to where there as well as they can be and then there'll be forced to basically go ahead and purchase. So, I think, that covered all of your questions, Matt."

Looking forward, what we're expecting, if you look at the total leakage that we have to oil and gas, it's about $360 million. Of that, about 1/3 is upstream, so say $120 million. And we're projecting that piece to be down around 1/3, around 30%, 35%, which is down an incremental $40 million. And then if you look at the remainder, which is mid and downstream, we expect a mid-single-digit type decline. So overall, what's in our forecast is an incremental $50 million of decline due to essentially the price of oil being down at the $30 a barrel level right now."

I think if you look back historically where AMETEK has had, say, negative organic growth is typically when the industrial cycle is down. And in my view, we are in an industrial recession right now. That's the view that the consensus of all of our managers is that we are in an industrial recession. And therefore, to get any sizable organic growth in this environment is challenging. And where AMETEK shines is that we're able to be very good on the cost side of the business, and therefore we are looking to be able to hold or slightly increase our earnings in a recessionary environment. So that's probably the best I can say. And if companies, I'll give you some examples, without specific names, but if you have a company that doesn't have oil and gas exposure or doesn't have a lot of exposure in Asia or in metals areas, they -- those companies are going to have a better opportunity to grow organically. And that's probably why you're hearing some of this I'll call it confusion in the market. We step back and we look at this kind of environment. We're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business, and we're going to look to deploy capital to increase our earnings. And remember, the guidance that I'm giving does not include any future acquisitions. So whatever we can do to deploy more capital and bring more companies into our own, we've got the operating capability that we've shown over many, many years. And over a period of time, we always create value. As a matter of fact, the way I view this environment right now is just a buying opportunity for AMETEK. We very seldom have a dip like our stock is experiencing right now. And I can tell you I'm going to increase my ownership. So that shows some commitment."

As a matter of fact, I heard -- recent board meeting the first time so he sees the multiple start to come down. So that's a good sign as well. So we're going to be aggressive to take advantage of this on the acquisitions side and you focus on costs. There isn't a lot you can do about the global macro. So you just -- you sort of have to wait that out, and when they come back, the earnings of this company are going to skyrocket. So I mean, that's the best way I can describe the situation.

And the reason is the whole economy was just crashing, everybody just stopped. It's the best way of saying it. And because nobody knew where the bottom was and I mean, that was a different kind of recession probably than I've experienced in my business career. So yes, your historical picture is exactly right. However, this recession, what I'm saying we're in now is different. It's not as deep, I'll start there. And I think in 2008 and 2009, I don't remember the actual numbers but I think we're down about 15% or something of that magnitude. We came back, we can back very strong right after that. But this is not about magnitude, and you can see that in our guidance where we're talking about organic growth for 2016 being just down low single-digits. So it's not anywhere near a significant an issue. So I would not use that as a model. Actually, if you go back to the previous recession before that, we did buy companies in that downturn. So that's what I think this is just an ideal opportunity to be aggressive, and I don't mean aggressive in the sense of buying companies that are not good. I mean, we've got the capital and we've got the manpower, and I don't know we're going to continue to look at companies rather pretty happy that already this year, we've announced deployment of about $300 million in capital. And as I said in my opening comments, over the last 24 months, we deployed $1.1 billion in capital. So I think it's going to continue. And I can't sit here and tell you exactly what we're going to acquire and what the capital outlays are going to be. I'm just telling you from a strategic viewpoint, it's a good time. That's probably the best way that I can characterize it. So, Joe, I don't know if that helps with your question."

So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and aerospace had a strong fourth quarter with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in actually all parts of that business, comme",773,"Yes, sure, I'll be glad to do that, Joe. So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and aerospace had a strong fourth quarter with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in actually all parts of that business, commercial OEM business and regional jets and our military business, believe it or not. Our EIG Aerospace business had an excellent year as they gained sizable new content on a number of attractive platforms. In 2015, they received a record $620 million in program awards on 35 different platforms, and that included Rolls-Royce for the Trent 7000 engine on the A330 neo, -- for fuel systems on the joint strike fighter and GE for the GE 9X engine, which will be on the new version of the 777. So they've done a really, really good job of getting content. Of course, when you're on these airplanes, that content must lasts for 20, 25 years. So looking to 2016, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits and that's why the continue to ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and some growth in business and regional jets mainly due to our content on new aircraft and in particular, the HondaJet. Moving to our Process, organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter obviously driven by weakness in upstream oil and gas. As I mentioned a moment ago, the weakness in upstream oil and gas in 2015 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. And for 2016, we expect sales for our Process instruments to be down low to mid-single digits organically driven by continued weakness across upstream oil and gas. The last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Their organic sales were flat versus last year's fourth quarter with solid growth in our programmable Power and Solidstate Controls business, offsetting weakness in our Power instruments business. And also for this business in 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down low to mid-single digits. So then if you look at all of EIG where you've got Aerospace up and both Process and Power & Industrial down slightly, if we then look across all EIG, we expect organic sales to be down there low to mid-single digits with our overall sales up low single digits really due to the acquisition of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX with obviously these last 2 deals being announced this morning. So that's our outlook for EIG. Moving now to EMG, and I'll start with the differentiated part of EMG. Organic sales here were down mid-single digits in the quarter driven as we have talked about by weakness in our Engineered Materials and interconnect and packaging business. And this is again the result of the commodity price deflation that I talked about. And for 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to actually be flat organically with the impact from commodity deflation within our metals business being mostly pronounced in the first half of 2016, which is again what I said in answer to 1 of the questions. And then the last part of EMG is Floorcare & Specialty Motors. They were gone actually midteens organically in the fourth quarter as a result of softer demand globally. But we actually have a pretty good outlook for that business. We expect sales for the business to be roughly flat organically. We won some content in new programs and our managers have done a great job managing that business. So that is the present outlook. So if you sum that up for EMG, overall sales are going to be up low single-digits just like EIG and in this case, it's driven by the acquisition of Global Tubes in the acquisition side. And for organic sales, we expect to be down low single-digits. And that, if you roll up then to answer your question for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting overall sales to be up low single-digits and organic sales to be down low single-digits. That's our best call at the present time. And if I can give you some flavor on our guidance, our guidance assumes these organic growth numbers that I just talked about, and the reason I pushed a little bit to the lower end is that I don't see as much upside on organic growth as possibly we could have some downside. And that's just because of the fogginess right now of the environment. It's the best way that I can say, and I'm trying to be accurate and tell you what my best thoughts are."

That investment will go more in EIG than it will in EMG. And I can give you some examples of where we're going to be putting that investment in. I mentioned in my opening talk that UPT is doing extremely well. This is a high-end measurement company. It does not have substantial exposure to some of the things that we have talked about on the negative side. And they're going to continue to invest. You may recall awhile back, we did the Creaform acquisition. That company has an just superlative in terms of organic growth. I mean, they're growing up numbers in the 15%, 20% region. These are basically instruments that can very accurately look at an object and convert it to a computer basically a CAD type of growing just by waving the instrument across an object and a very, very good marketplace, and we're going to continue to invest that business. And we're also not afraid to invest in some of the market that are down. If you look at some of our businesses that are in oil and gas, probably more in the mid-and down cycle -- down area of oil and gas, we'll probably invest more there. And we'll continue to invest in Power & Industrial. And I gave some examples of some of the products in my opening talk. So the focus on engineering investment is going to be higher in EIG. The focus on capital deployment will be higher in EMG because those businesses require more capital to grow. So that's sort of the view of how we're going to invest. I hope that helps."

So if you look at the total commercial build, it's roughly flat. However, if you look at the new aircraft, those are growing at a very, very nice rate. And we have significant content on the new aircraft. And in particular, Airbus. If you look at historically, more have much more content on Boeing aircraft but with the new aircraft Airbus is bring into the market, we now have a sizable content on those aircraft. And therefore, our projections are higher than the total build rate for all aircraft because of the new aircraft in our content wins."

31860,321835994,928059,"Ametek Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","AMETEK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.

AMETEK delivered solid operational results in the quarter to complete another strong year. We achieved a record level of operating income, operating margins and diluted earnings per share in 2015, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Looking ahead, we expect these difficult conditions to persist in 2016. Therefore, we have taken additional realignment actions in the fourth quarter to help minimize the effects of the ongoing global softness. These realignment costs totaled $20.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share, and we expect annualized savings of approximately $35 million as a result of these actions with an approximate $20 million benefit in 2016. Before covering the financial results, please note that any references to 2014 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015 and the Zygo integration costs in 2014. 
Now on to the fourth quarter and full year results. In the fourth quarter, sales were $988 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were down 4%. Acquisitions added 3% and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. Operating income in the quarter was $229.5 million, down 1% versus 2014's comparable quarter. Operating income margin for the fourth quarter was very strong at 23.2%, a 50-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $150.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were flat with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, sales were $4 billion, down 1% versus 2014. Operating income was a record $944.3 million, up 3% from 2014 and full year 2015 operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 23.8%. Diluted earnings per share were up 5% over 2014, ending the year at $2.55 per diluted share, a record level. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $628.4 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was down 2%, while the Surface Vision acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Solid growth in our Aerospace and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses was more than offset by weakness in our upstream oil and gas business, as a result of the continued slump in oil prices. EIG's operating income increased 2% to $170.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 27.2% in the quarter, a 110-basis-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group managed well through a very difficult market environment. Sales were $359.6 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's comparable quarter with organic sales down 8%. The acquisition of Global Tubes contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses as well as soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. EMG's operating income of $70.9 million was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter, down 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. 
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. In 2015, we acquired 2 businesses, Global Tubes and Surface Vision. We deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired roughly $180 million in sales on these 2 acquisitions. 2016 is off to a solid start as we announced today the acquisition of 2 additional businesses, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales. 
First, I will touch on Brookfield. Brookfield Engineering Laboratories is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. Brookfield provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers, as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum type products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. Brookfield is headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India. The company has annual sales of about $55 million. 
Now let me touch on ESP/SurgeX. They are a leader in power protection. Their patented protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing Power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Power business, provided on -- providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. They are headquartered in Knightdale, North Carolina, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million. 
Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 8 businesses, deployed over $1.1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $510 million in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us throughout the year, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially in low growth environments. Acquisitions will also continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities, which gives us ample liquidity to continue this strategy. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We continue to invest in development and expansion of our global sales channels, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. Our Ultra Precision Technologies division continues to see great results from their global expansion investments with mid-teens organic sales growth across Asia in the fourth quarter. Their Taylor Hobson business delivered excellent growth in China and India in the quarter, following recent investments to expand their sales and service infrastructure in these 2 key markets. Also, their Creaform business continues to see great growth internationally with double-digit growth in Asia in the quarter. This growth is being driven by continued development of their sales network across Asia and from strong expansion in the quality control market, driven by a number of recent new product introductions. 
Now moving on to New Products. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing New Products to serve their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets and applications. We have consistently invested in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers. As reflected in our vitality Index, we continue to see excellent results from these efforts. Revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 26% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% in last year's fourth quarter. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or about 5% of sales. We are excited about some recent new product introductions. Our GMC business, the leader in precision vibration isolation systems, recently introduced the Everstill K-400, a compact vibration cancellation system. The Everstill is ideal for the small vibration-sensitive instruments such as optical microscopes, scanning probe microscopes and metrology instruments. It's patented vibration cancellation technology is especially suited for the 1 to 10 hertz vibration range, where precision instruments tend to be the most sensitive. The portable Everstill is ideal for bench tops and work tables, as it requires only a standard AC power outlet. The LEAP 5000, the latest generation of atom probe microscopes from our CAMECA business, was recognized by R&D Magazine with an R&D 100 Award. Widely recognized as the Oscars of innovation, the R&D 100 Award is presently presented annually to the 100 most significant new developments in research and development, as determined by an independent panel of judges. This product was recognized as a breakthrough instrument, whose unique capabilities have enabled engineers and scientists to gain new insight into materials and processes. 
Lastly, AMETEK Power instruments recently added an IEC version of their JEMStar II electricity revenue meter for use outside North America. The JEMStar II is the most accurate revenue meter on the market with the broadest communication options and features the industry's first color graphic display. The meter is specifically designed for applications with a high electric usage, such as utility generation and transmission in substations. 
I will now touch on Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. In slow growth environments, the success of our operational excellence initiatives takes on an even greater importance as we were able to drive meaningful margin expansion while continuing to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, we realized approximately $150 million in savings in 2015 through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to the savings was our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we recognized approximately $75 million in savings for all of 2015. For 2016, we expect approximately $120 million in total savings through our Operational Excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2016. We do not anticipate a meaningful change in global economic conditions in 2016. We expect sluggish conditions across oil and gas, emerging markets and the broad industrial markets to continue. As a result, we anticipate 2016 revenue to be up low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015, with organic growth down low single digits for all of AMETEK. Earnings for this year are expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share, probably focused more on the lower end of that range, and that's flat to up 4% over 2015. First quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings in the first quarter to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share, versus $0.63 in last year's first quarter. 
So in summary, our overall business performed well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2015. We delivered record operating results in 2015, despite persistent global economic weakness. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to continue to invest in our businesses and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our strong portfolio of businesses and commitment to driving success through our 4 growth strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent long-term growth. 
Before turning the call over to Bob Mandos to cover the financial details, I wanted to note that Bob has decided to retire effective May 15 of this year. Bob has done a tremendous job over his 35 years of service with AMETEK, and he will be greatly missed. I want to thank Bob for all of his contributions to AMETEK, and wish him all the best in his retirement. Bill Burke, who many of you know, will be assuming the CFO role on May 15. Bill has also done a superb job for AMETEK over his 28-year career and is well-suited for his new role. Now, Bob, if you could cover the financial details, please."

As Frank noted, we had a good fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down roughly in line with sales on a percentage basis. General administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% sales. Other expense in the quarter was up approximately $6.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an insurance gain at last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus last year's fourth quarter rate of 27.1%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables, was 19% of sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter level. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $69 million for the full year. Full year 2015 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2016 capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter and $150 million for the full year. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million and free cash flow was $176 million, representing 128% of net income. Excluding the $50 million contribution to our U.S.-defined-benefit pension plan in the first quarter, full year 2015 operating cash flow was $723 million and full year free cash flow was $654 million or 111% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2015, we spent $360 million on acquisitions. And thus far in 2016, we had deployed approximately $300 million on acquisitions. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $130 million. Total debt was $1.94 billion at December 31, up approximately $230 million from 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $381 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 32.4%. At December 31, we had approximately $930 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong 2015. We are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

Our goals and how we price these deals, we look for a 10% return on invested capital in year 3. Both of these deals actually exceed that. So we're pretty confident of getting a good return for our shareholders. Following up on Brookfield, Brookfield is just a phenomenal company. Their name is a well, well known in the industry, and it's almost synonymous with rheometers, because they basically have a very, very strong position in that market. And their margins are lower than the AMETEK margins. So we believe over time, we can definitely put our operational excellence capabilities in place there and move those margins up to the AMETEK average and possibly beyond. So pretty excited about both of these deals. Obviously, doing deals is the primary use of our cash flow, and we're going to continue to make acquisitions throughout the year, and we think it's a very significant value creator for our shareholders."

But what happened during the Q4 is that there was a significant decline in metal prices. A few examples, nickel was down 13%; copper just in the quarter was down 17%; and vanadium was down 23%. Now in terms of how that affects the profitability, we passed the commodity prices through, so that there is not a major impact from the viewpoint that the prices came down from that perspective. The issue is that because the prices were coming down and so rapidly, our customers basically stopped purchasing. They just wanted to make darn sure they were purchasing at the bottom, instead of at a different higher level. So the impact here was, therefore, on the sales line from the viewpoint that they essentially stopped buying, and that is continuing into Q1. We expect some stabilization in Q2. And probably pretty sure about would be by Q3 that those -- that will stabilize because in essence, those customers need the product. I mean, that's the fundamental issue. So they'll drive their inventories down to where there as well as they can be and then there'll be forced to basically go ahead and purchase. So, I think, that covered all of your questions, Matt."

I think if you look back historically where AMETEK has had, say, negative organic growth is typically when the industrial cycle is down. And in my view, we are in an industrial recession right now. That's the view that the consensus of all of our managers is that we are in an industrial recession. And therefore, to get any sizable organic growth in this environment is challenging. And where AMETEK shines is that we're able to be very good on the cost side of the business, and therefore, we are looking to be able to hold or slightly increase our earnings in a recessionary environment. So that's probably the best I can say. And if companies -- I'll give you some examples, without specific names, but if you have a company that doesn't have oil and gas exposure or doesn't have a lot of exposure in Asia or in metals areas, they -- those companies are going to have a better opportunity to grow organically. And that's probably why you're hearing some of this, call it, confusion in the market. We step back and we look at these kind of environments, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business, and we're going to look to deploy capital to increase our earnings. 
And remember, the guidance that I'm giving does not include any future acquisitions. So whatever we can do to deploy more capital and bring more companies into our own, we've got the operating capability that we've shown over many, many years. And over a period of time, we always create value. A matter of fact, the way I view this environment right now, this is a buying opportunity for AMETEK. We very seldom have a dip like our stock is experiencing right now. And I can tell you, I'm going to increase my ownership. So that shows some commitment."

You take advantage of this on the acquisitions side, and you focus on costs. There isn't a lot you can do about the global macro. So you just -- you sort of have to wait that out, and when they come back, the earnings of this company are going to skyrocket. So I mean, that's the best way I can describe the situation.

And the reason is that the whole economy was just crashing, everybody just stopped. It's the best way of saying it. And because nobody knew where the bottom was and I mean, that was a different kind of recession, probably, than I've experienced in my business career. So yes, your historical picture is exactly right. However, this recession, what I'm saying, we're in now is different. It's not as deep, I'll start there. And I think in 2008 and 2009, I don't remember the actual numbers, but I think we're down about 15% or something of that magnitude. We came back, we came back very strong right after that. But this is not about magnitude, and you can see that in our guidance where we're talking about organic growth for 2016 being just down low single digits. So it's not anywhere near a significant an issue. So I would not use that as a model. Actually, if you go back to the previous recession before that, we did buy companies in that downturn. So that's why I think this is just an ideal opportunity to be aggressive. And I don't mean aggressive in the sense of buying companies that are not good. I mean, we've got the capital. And we've got the manpower. And I don't know, we're going to continue to look at companies. We're actually pretty happy that, already this year, we've announced the deployment of about $300 million in capital. And as I said in my opening comments, over the last 24 months, we deployed $1.1 billion in capital. So I think it's going to continue. Now I can't sit here and tell you exactly what we're going to acquire and what the capital outlays are going to be. I'm just telling you, from a strategic viewpoint, it's a good time.

So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in, actually, all parts of that business: co",780,"Yes, sure, I'll be glad to do that, Joe. So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in, actually, all parts of that business: commercial OEM, business and regional jets and our military business, believe it or not. Our EIG aerospace business had an excellent year as they gained sizable new content on a number of attractive platforms. In 2015, they received a record $620 million in life or program awards on 35 different platforms, and that included Rolls-Royce for the Trent 7000 engine on the A330neo; Parker Hannifin for fuel systems on the Joint Strike Fighter; and GE for the GE9X engine, which will be on the new version of the 777. So they've done a really, really good job of getting content. And of course, when you're on these airplanes, that content lasts for 20, 25 years. So looking to 2016, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, and that's why the continued to ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and some growth in business and regional jets, mainly due to our content in -- on new aircraft and in particular, the HondaJet. Moving to our Process, organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, obviously, driven by weakness in upstream oil and gas. As I mentioned a moment ago, the weakness in upstream oil and gas in 2015 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. And for 2016, we expect sales for our Process instruments to be down low to mid-single digits organically, driven by continued weakness across upstream oil and gas. The last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Their organic sales were flat versus last year's fourth quarter, with solid growth in our programmable Power and Solidstate Controls business, offsetting weakness in our Power instruments business. And also, for this business, in 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down low to mid-single digits. So then, if you look at all of EIG where you've got Aerospace up and both Process and Power & Industrial down slightly, if we then look across all EIG, we expect organic sales to be down there low to mid-single digits, with overall sales up low single digits really due to the acquisition of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX, with, obviously, these last 2 deals being announced this morning. So that's our outlook for EIG. Moving now to EMG, and I'll start with the differentiated part of EMG. Organic sales here were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven, as we have talked about, by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. And this is, again, the result of the commodity price deflation that I talked about. And for 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to actually be flat organically, with the impact from commodity deflation within our metals business being mostly pronounced in the first half of 2016, which is, again, what I said in answer to 1 of the questions. And then the last part of EMG is Floorcare & Specialty Motors. They were down, actually, mid-teens organically in the fourth quarter as a result of softer demand globally. But we actually have a pretty good outlook for that business. We expect the sales for the business to be roughly flat organically. We won some content in new programs, and our managers had done a great job managing that business. So that is the present outlook. So if you sum that up for EMG, overall sales are going to be up low single digits just like EIG and in this case, it's driven by the acquisition of Global Tubes on the acquisition side. And for organic sales, we expect to be down low single digits. And that, if you roll up and to answer your question for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting overall sales to be up low single digits and organic sales to be down low single digits. That's our best call at the present time. And if I can give you some flavor on our guidance, our guidance assumes these organic growth numbers that I just talked about, and the reason I pushed a little bit to the lower end is that I don't see as much upside on organic growth as possibly we could have some downside. And that's just because of the fogginess right now of the environment. It's the best way that I can say it, and I'm trying to be accurate and tell you what my best thoughts are."

What's in my guidance and in our guidance, I should say, is that price minus inflation will be flat. And again, we're looking at the global macro, and we're just not going to assume that we're going to get any pricing above inflation. But we have a lot of pressure on our operating managers to, at a minimum, cover inflation, and maybe we'll end up with some positive there. But that's what's included in the guidance, Rick."

And so we would never go to the point where we are not investment grade. So capital and leverage is not the determinant in our acquisition strategy. It's finding really good businesses like the 2 we announced this morning. And we just have the capital to deploy, and I just don't have to worry about leverage. I mean, just to give you another statistic, with the budget or the guidance I gave you, the operating cash flow of AMETEK will be about $800 million. Our capital deployment, as Bob indicated in his talk, is going to be in the $70 million, $75 million region. So the free cash flow, I don't know what your percentage was in there, Bob, it's about 119% of net income. So you can just see that the cash flow of the company is incredible, and that's why acquisitions are very important, because we think that's the best utilization of capital to get you a good return."

That investment will go more in EIG than it will in EMG. And I can give you some examples of where we're going to be putting that investment in. I mentioned in my opening talk that UPT is doing extremely well. This is a high-end measurement company. It does not have substantial exposure to some of the things that we have talked about on the negative side. And they're going to continue to invest. You may recall awhile back, we did the Creaform acquisition. That company has been just superlative in terms of organic growth. I mean, they're growing at numbers in the 15%, 20% region. These are basically instruments that can very accurately look at an object and convert it to a computer, basically, a CAD-type of drawing, just by waving the instrument across an object; and a very, very good marketplace. And we're going to continue to invest in that business. And we're also not afraid to invest in some of the markets that are down. If you look at some of our businesses that are in oil and gas, probably, more in the mid and downside -- down area of oil and gas, we'll probably invest more there. And we'll continue to invest in Power & Industrial. And I gave some examples of some of the products in my opening talk. So the focus on engineering investment is going to be higher in EIG. The focus on capital deployment will be higher in EMG because those businesses require more capital to grow. So that's sort of the view of how we're going to invest. I hope that helps."

And therefore, the return on invested capital is excellent. Also, with those smaller deals, the multiples tend to be lower, so that you're not paying quite as much as you will for a larger deal. So I would say that sweet spot is in that sort of $75 million to $200 million area in terms of sales. And when I look at the backlog, we have a fair number of deals that are in our backlog that fit that size range. We also have some deals that are larger, and we also have some deals that are smaller.

On your first question, there is not a substantial impact for the year or in the first quarter. In our guidance, actually, there are some costs that are going through the first quarter, which is included in our guidance, and there's about $0.005 of costs that are going through the P&L. And as we go through the year, we'll probably recapture that cost downside. But there's not a substantial EPS positive in 2016, where we're going to see the impacts will be more in 2017 from an EPS viewpoint. And in terms of some of the announcements around Boeing, if you look at the outlook for Boeing for 2016, their total builds are going to be down about 2%, but offsetting that, Airbus is going to be up about 2%. So if you look at the total commercial build, it's roughly flat. However, if you look at the new aircraft, those are growing at a very, very nice rate. And we have significant content on the new aircraft. And in particular, Airbus, if you look historically, AMETEK has been much more -- have much more content on Boeing aircraft. But with the new aircraft that Airbus is bringing into the market, we now have sizable content on those aircraft. And therefore, our projections are higher than the total build rate for all aircraft because of the new aircraft and our content wins."

AMETEK delivered solid operational results in the quarter to complete another strong year. We achieved a record level of operating income, operating margins and diluted earnings per share in 2015, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Looking ahead, we expect these difficult conditions to persist in 2016. Therefore, we have taken additional realignment actions in the fourth quarter to help minimize the effects of the ongoing global softness. These realignment costs totaled $20.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share, and we expect annualized savings of approximately $35 million as a result of these actions with an approximate $20 million benefit in 2016. Before covering the financial results, please note that any references to 2014 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015 and the Zygo integration costs in 2014. 
Now on to the fourth quarter and full year results. In the fourth quarter, sales were $988 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were down 4%. Acquisitions added 3% and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. Operating income in the quarter was $229.5 million, down 1% versus 2014's comparable quarter. Operating income margin for the fourth quarter was very strong at 23.2%, a 50-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $150.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were flat with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, sales were $4 billion, down 1% versus 2014. Operating income was a record $944.3 million, up 3% from 2014 and full year 2015 operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 23.8%. Diluted earnings per share were up 5% over 2014, ending the year at $2.55 per diluted share, a record level. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $628.4 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was down 2%, while the Surface Vision acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Solid growth in our Aerospace and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses was more than offset by weakness in our upstream oil and gas business, as a result of the continued slump in oil prices. EIG's operating income increased 2% to $170.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 27.2% in the quarter, a 110-basis-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group managed well through a very difficult market environment. Sales were $359.6 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's comparable quarter with organic sales down 8%. The acquisition of Global Tubes contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses as well as soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. EMG's operating income of $70.9 million was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter, down 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. 
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. In 2015, we acquired 2 businesses, Global Tubes and Surface Vision. We deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired roughly $180 million in sales on these 2 acquisitions. 2016 is off to a solid start as we announced today the acquisition of 2 additional businesses, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales. 
First, I will touch on Brookfield. Brookfield Engineering Laboratories is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. Brookfield provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers, as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum type products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. Brookfield is headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India. The company has annual sales of about $55 million. 
Now let me touch on ESP/SurgeX. They are a leader in power protection. Their patented protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing Power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, provided on -- providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. They are headquartered in Knightdale, North Carolina, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million. 
Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 8 businesses, deployed over $1.1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $510 million in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us throughout the year, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially in low growth environments. Acquisitions will also continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities, which gives us ample liquidity to continue this strategy. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We continue to invest in development and expansion of our global sales channels, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. Our Ultra Precision Technologies division continues to see great results from their global expansion investments with mid-teens organic sales growth across Asia in the fourth quarter. Their Taylor Hobson business delivered excellent growth in China and India in the quarter, following recent investments to expand their sales and service infrastructure in these 2 key markets. Also, their Creaform business continues to see great growth internationally with double-digit growth in Asia in the quarter. This growth is being driven by continued development of their sales network across Asia and from strong expansion in the quality control market, driven by a number of recent new product introductions. 
Now moving on to New Products. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing New Products to serve their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets and applications. We have consistently invested in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers. As reflected in our vitality Index, we continue to see excellent results from these efforts. Revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 26% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% in last year's fourth quarter. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or about 5% of sales. We are excited about some recent new product introductions. Our TMC business, the leader in precision vibration isolation systems, recently introduced the Everstill K-400, a compact vibration cancellation system. The Everstill is ideal for small vibration-sensitive instruments such as optical microscopes, scanning probe microscopes and metrology instruments. Its patented vibration cancellation technology is especially suited for the 1 to 10 hertz vibration range, where precision instruments tend to be the most sensitive. The portable Everstill is ideal for bench tops and work tables, as it requires only a standard AC power outlet. The LEAP 5000, the latest generation of atom probe microscopes from our CAMECA business, was recognized by R&D Magazine with an R&D 100 Award. Widely recognized as the Oscars of innovation, the R&D 100 Award is presently presented annually to the 100 most significant new developments in research and development, as determined by an independent panel of judges. This product was recognized as a breakthrough instrument, whose unique capabilities have enabled engineers and scientists to gain new insight into materials and processes. 
Lastly, AMETEK Power instruments recently added an IEC version of their JEMStar II electricity revenue meter for use outside North America. The JEMStar II is the most accurate revenue meter on the market with the broadest communication options and features the industry's first color graphic display. The meter is specifically designed for applications with a high electric usage, such as utility generation and transmission in substations. 
I will now touch on Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. In slow growth environments, the success of our operational excellence initiatives takes on an even greater importance as we were able to drive meaningful margin expansion while continuing to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, we realized approximately $150 million in savings in 2015 through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to these savings was our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we recognized approximately $75 million in savings for all of 2015. For 2016, we expect approximately $120 million in total savings through our Operational Excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2016. We do not anticipate a meaningful change in global economic conditions in 2016. We expect sluggish conditions across oil and gas, emerging markets and the broad industrial markets to continue. As a result, we anticipate 2016 revenue to be up low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015, with organic growth down low single digits for all of AMETEK. Earnings for this year are expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share, probably focused more on the lower end of that range, and that's flat to up 4% over 2015. First quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings in the first quarter to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share, versus $0.63 in last year's first quarter. 
So in summary, our overall business performed well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2015. We delivered record operating results in 2015, despite persistent global economic weakness. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to continue to invest in our businesses and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our strong portfolio of businesses and commitment to driving success through our 4 growth strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent long-term growth. 
Before turning the call over to Bob Mandos to cover the financial details, I wanted to note that Bob has decided to retire effective May 15 of this year. Bob has done a tremendous job over his 35 years of service with AMETEK, and he will be greatly missed. I want to thank Bob for all of his contributions to AMETEK, and wish him all the best in his retirement. Bill Burke, who many of you know, will be assuming the CFO role on May 15. Bill has also done a superb job for AMETEK over his 28-year career and is well-suited for his new role. Now, Bob, if you could cover the financial details, please."

As Frank noted, we had a good fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down roughly in line with sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was up approximately $6.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an insurance gain at last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus last year's fourth quarter rate of 27.1%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables, was 19% of sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter level. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $69 million for the full year. Full year 2015 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2016 capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter and $150 million for the full year. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million and free cash flow was $176 million, representing 128% of net income. Excluding the $50 million contribution to our U.S.-defined-benefit pension plan in the first quarter, full year 2015 operating cash flow was $723 million and full year free cash flow was $654 million or 111% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2015, we expended $360 million on acquisitions. And thus far in 2016, we had deployed approximately $300 million on acquisitions. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $130 million. Total debt was $1.94 billion at December 31, up approximately $230 million from 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $381 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 32.4%.

Our goals and how we price these deals, we look for a 10% return on invested capital in year 3. Both of these deals actually exceed that. So we're pretty confident of getting a good return for our shareholders. Following up on Brookfield, Brookfield is just a phenomenal company. Their name is well, well known in the industry, and it's almost synonymous with rheometers, because they basically have a very, very strong position in that market. And their margins are lower than the AMETEK margins. So we believe over time, we can definitely put our operational excellence capabilities in place there and move those margins up to the AMETEK average and possibly beyond. So pretty excited about both of these deals. Obviously, doing deals is the primary use of our cash flow, and we're going to continue to make acquisitions throughout the year, and we think it's a very significant value creator for our shareholders."

But what happened during the Q4 is that there was a significant decline in metal prices. A few examples, nickel was down 13%; copper just in the quarter was down 17%; and vanadium was down 23%. Now in terms of how that affects the profitability, we passed the commodity prices through, so that there is not a major impact from the viewpoint that the prices came down from that perspective. The issue is that because the prices were coming down and so rapidly, our customers basically stopped purchasing. They just wanted to make darn sure they were purchasing at the bottom, instead of at a different higher level. So the impact here was, therefore, on the sales line from the viewpoint that they essentially stopped buying, and that is continuing into Q1. We expect some stabilization in Q2. And probably a pretty sure bet would be by Q3 that those -- that will stabilize because in essence, those customers need the product. I mean, that's the fundamental issue. So they'll drive their inventories down to where there -- as low as they can be and then they'll be forced to basically go ahead and purchase. So I think that covered all of your questions, Matt."

I think if you look back historically where AMETEK has had, say, negative organic growth, it is typically when the industrial cycle is down. And in my view, we are in an industrial recession right now. That's the view that -- the consensus of all of our managers is that we are in an industrial recession. And therefore, to get any sizable organic growth in this environment is challenging. And where AMETEK shines is that we're able to be very good on the cost side of the business, and therefore, we are looking to be able to hold or slightly increase our earnings in a recessionary environment. So that's probably the best I can say. And if companies -- I'll give you some examples, without specific names, but if you have a company that doesn't have oil and gas exposure or doesn't have a lot of exposure in Asia or in metals areas, they -- those companies are going to have a better opportunity to grow organically. And that's probably why you're hearing some of this, call it, confusion in the market. We step back and we look at these kind of environments, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business, and we're going to look to deploy capital to increase our earnings. 
And remember, the guidance that I'm giving does not include any future acquisitions. So whatever we can do to deploy more capital and bring more companies into our realm, we've got the operating capability that we've shown over many, many years. And over a period of time, we always create value. A matter of fact, the way I view this environment right now, this is a buying opportunity for AMETEK. We very seldom have a dip like our stock is experiencing right now. And I can tell you, I'm going to increase my ownership. So that shows some commitment."

And the reason is that the whole economy was just crashing, everybody just stopped. It's the best way of saying it. And because nobody knew where the bottom was and I mean, that was a different kind of recession, probably, than I've experienced in my business career. So yes, your historical picture is exactly right. However, this recession, what I'm saying, we're in now is different. It's not as deep, I'll start there. And I think in 2008 and 2009, I don't remember the actual numbers, but I think we're down about 15% or something of that magnitude. We came back, we came back very strong right after that. But this is not of that magnitude, and you can see that in our guidance where we're talking about organic growth for 2016 being just down low single digits. So it's not anywhere near as significant an issue. So I would not use that as a model. Actually, if you go back to the previous recession before that, we did buy companies in that downturn. So that's why I think this is just an ideal opportunity to be aggressive. And I don't mean aggressive in the sense of buying companies that are not good. I mean, we've got the capital. And we've got the manpower. And I don't know, we're going to continue to look at companies. We're actually pretty happy that, already this year, we've announced the deployment of about $300 million in capital. And as I said in my opening comments, over the last 24 months, we deployed $1.1 billion in capital. So I think it's going to continue. Now I can't sit here and tell you exactly what we're going to acquire and what the capital outlays are going to be. I'm just telling you, from a strategic viewpoint, it's a good time.

So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in, actually, all parts of that business: co",779,"Yes, sure, I'll be glad to do that, Joe. So let me start with EIG and Aerospace. EIG and Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength in, actually, all parts of that business: commercial OEM, business and regional jets and our military business, believe it or not. Our EIG aerospace business had an excellent year as they gained sizable new content on a number of attractive platforms. In 2015, they received a record $620 million in life or program awards on 35 different platforms, and that included Rolls-Royce for the Trent 7000 engine on the A330neo; Parker Hannifin for fuel systems on the Joint Strike Fighter; and GE for the GE9X engine, which will be on the new version of the 777. So they've done a really, really good job of getting content. And of course, when you're on these airplanes, that content lasts for 20, 25 years. So looking to 2016, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, and that's why the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and some growth in business and regional jets, mainly due to our content in -- on new aircraft and in particular, the HondaJet. Moving to our Process, organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, obviously, driven by weakness in upstream oil and gas. As I mentioned a moment ago, the weakness in upstream oil and gas in 2015 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. And for 2016, we expect sales for our Process instruments to be down low to mid-single digits organically, driven by continued weakness across upstream oil and gas. The last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There, organic sales were flat versus last year's fourth quarter, with solid growth in our programmable Power and Solidstate Controls business, offsetting weakness in our Power instruments business. And also, for this business, in 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down low to mid-single digits. So then, if you look at all of EIG where you've got Aerospace up and both Process and Power & Industrial down slightly, if we then look across all EIG, we expect organic sales to be down there low to mid-single digits, with overall sales up low single digits really due to the acquisition of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX, with, obviously, these last 2 deals being announced this morning. So that's our outlook for EIG. Moving now to EMG, and I'll start with the differentiated part of EMG. Organic sales here were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven, as we have talked about, by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. And this is, again, the result of the commodity price deflation that I talked about. And for 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to actually be flat organically, with the impact from commodity deflation within our metals business being mostly pronounced in the first half of 2016, which is, again, what I said in answer to 1 of the questions. And then the last part of EMG is Floorcare & Specialty Motors. They were down, actually, mid-teens organically in the fourth quarter as a result of softer demand globally. But we actually have a pretty good outlook for that business. We expect the sales for the business to be roughly flat organically. We won some content in new programs, and our managers had done a great job managing that business. So that is the present outlook. So if you sum that up for EMG, overall sales are going to be up low single digits just like EIG and in this case, it's driven by the acquisition of Global Tubes on the acquisition side. And for organic sales, we expect to be down low single digits. And that, if you roll up and to answer your question for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting overall sales to be up low single digits and organic sales to be down low single digits. That's our best call at the present time. And if I can give you some flavor on our guidance, our guidance assumes these organic growth numbers that I just talked about, and the reason I pushed a little bit to the lower end is that I don't see as much upside on organic growth as possibly we could have some downside.

It's finding really good businesses like the 2 we announced this morning. And we just have the capital to deploy, and I just don't have to worry about leverage. I mean, just to give you another statistic, with the budget or the guidance I gave you, the operating cash flow of AMETEK will be about $800 million. Our capital deployment, as Bob indicated in his talk, is going to be in the $70 million, $75 million region. So the free cash flow, I don't know what your percentage was in there, Bob, it's about 119% of net income.

I mentioned in my opening talk that UPT is doing extremely well. This is a high-end measurement company. It does not have substantial exposure to some of the things that we have talked about on the negative side. And they're going to continue to invest. You may recall a while back, we did the Creaform acquisition. That company has been just superlative in terms of organic growth. I mean, they're growing at numbers in the 15%, 20% region. These are basically instruments that can very accurately look at an object and convert it to a computer, basically, a CAD-type of drawing, just by waving the instrument across an object; and a very, very good marketplace.

And whomever we decide, most likely Dave, obviously, who will take over, they'll be dealing, obviously, with all of the day-to-day issues."

On your first question, there is not a substantial impact for the year or in the first quarter. In our guidance, actually, there are some costs that are going through the first quarter, which is included in our guidance, and there's about $0.005 of costs that are going through the P&L. And as we go through the year, we'll probably recapture that cost downside. But there's not a substantial EPS positive in 2016, where we're going to see the impacts will be more in 2017 from an EPS viewpoint. And in terms of some of the announcements around Boeing, if you look at the outlook for Boeing for 2016, their total builds are going to be down about 2%, but offsetting that, Airbus is going to be up about 2%. So if you look at the total commercial build, it's roughly flat. However, if you look at the new aircraft, those are growing at a very, very nice rate. And we have significant content on the new aircraft. And in particular, Airbus, if you look historically, AMETEK has been much more -- have much more content on Boeing aircraft. But with the new aircraft that Airbus is bringing into the market, we now have sizable content on those aircraft. And therefore, our projections are higher than the total build rate for all aircraft because of the new aircraft and our content wins."

AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we are seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets.
These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remained confident in the long-term positioning and the growth prospects for our business. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. Now onto the financial results.
In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter.
Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57, or down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance.
Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.
Now turning to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter, organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision Brookfield Engineering and ESP/SurgeX contributed  5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind.
The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process business which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We are seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream and in the mid and downstream markets.
EIGs operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year's first quarter.
Electromechanical Group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, the acquisition of Global Tubes added 6% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind.
The lower sales were driven largely by the impact in commodity prices deflation and our engineered materials and packaging business as well as from soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. EMGs operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
I'll now provide some updates on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions.
Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We are focused on consistently executing on each of the strategies over the business cycle. However, in slow growth environments,  we increased our focus on Strategic Acquisitions and Operational Excellence initiatives, while ensuring we continue to make targeted investments in research and development in global expansion.
First, let me touch on acquisitions.
We've got a good start of the year, acquiring 2 business in the first quarter, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.
ESP/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, project, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site.
In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired power of our business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion.
The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina.
Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of discometers [ph] and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum products.
The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They are headquartered in Middleborrough [ph] Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany and the United Kingdom, China and India and of annual sales of approximately $55 million.
The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first 6 months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration.
Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active and so we are quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value.
Now turning to Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees are doing a great job driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tools.
Our Operational Excellence initiatives take on even greater importance and become more of a focus in slow growth environments. For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total Operational Excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic impairment initiatives driving approximately $60 million of the total savings.
The total Operational Excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams.
Now moving on to new products. We're pleased with the continued success of our new product development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding and existing markets and penetrating adjacent markets.
Despite the slow growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our new product development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year.
We continue to see excellent results from these investment as our vitality index, which measures revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years, was 22% of sales in the quarter. We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The newsy post energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our Spectro Analytical Instruments business  is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact, benchtop unit incorporates a number of advances that allow it to perform rapid, multielement analysis with greater accuracy and precision.
The instruments and enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research as well as precise outline quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing and pharmaceutical production.
The new extreme performance series of [indiscernible] from AMETEK delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military aerospace and industrial environments. The new fans features shockproof, middle spec construction and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone are stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks and personnel and airborne land-based and sea born installations. 
Our Zygo business provided high-precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitation waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein's 1915 Theory of Relativity. The international team of scientist that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced detectors that incorporated very high precision optical components manufactured by Zygo. The optics manufactured to some sub-nanometer tolerances are among the most precise optics ever made. I'd like to recognize the Zygo team on their
contribution to the success of this important, global, scientific project. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 33% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence and attractive higher growth regions in market segments to continued investments in our sales and service capabilities and through the expansion of our technology into a new adjacent market segments. Want to highlight one of the recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. 
Our process instruments business has pioneered near infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production. The process instruments business is now adapting the TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing through modifying its existing model 5100 series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drawing.
The use of this technology as an online analysis tool allows manufacturers to obtain a clear picture of the drawing process in real-time. It is an economical and efficient technique for determining driver endpoint detection since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze and restart the drying process.
The process instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology.
Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end-market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015 with organic sales down low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2015. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year.
Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter.
In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes the point of capital on strategic acquisitions making growth investments in new product development and global expansion and executing on our operational excellence initiatives.
Our strong cash flow and improving operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

I will provide further details.In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down in line with organic sales on an organic basis. General and administrative expenses w",455,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid first quarter. I will provide further details.
In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down in line with organic sales on an organic basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 28.1% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives.
For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from its full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remained a key priority.
Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million.
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income.
For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income.
The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisition of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million.
Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year end. Offsetting that debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio for March 31 of 35.7%.
At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increasing the side of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million, and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a large financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives.
Our highest priority is our capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, our business has performed well in the first quarter, despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

The key issue is that we have exposure on both sides of our company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our company and we had just seen, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas in terms of the downturn last year, when we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on and the conditions are worse. If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought for 2016 with respect to 2015, we'd be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million and that changed. There was an inflection point, actually, right around the time of our last earnings call when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happens, we just saw a large number of projects just moved to the right and -- that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen, but they're going to be moved and probably moved, many of them into next year. So we missed all that particular business and is simply because the changes have been so dramatic and it's very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we are operating the company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing. And I would say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company with the issue with medals pricing and the deflation that happened when we talked about this in the fourth quarter, in a way, a similar thing happened, that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remain soft through the first quarter. And now the good news in that particular market is we are starting to feel improvements. We're -- actually, our order intake is improving so we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we're not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is, really, a market related issue with dramatic changes on each side of the company that's causing this problem. Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we're actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We've met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good. One of the better ones in the industry. So we are managing a difficult situation as well as, I believe, anybody could manage it. But that's fundamentally what happened. I hope that helps."

And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So when I think about -- when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that probably for the last 4 or 5 quarters, and clearly that didn't materialize, but I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS to the 20 -- to your new guidance of -- the new guidance range that you provided today."

The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at for the year, we think -- and our guidance assumes that we're going to be 2 points less on organic growth and that's a result of the 2 factors predominantly that I've talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that's $80 million. $80 million detrimental -- detrimental, excuse me, they are detrimental too, I guess, detrimental margins of this company, similarly to when they -- when volume goes up on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it, I'll take it to make the a number easy 50%, you got $40 million of pretax operating income and that's $0.12 or $0.13 a share. Yes, we haven't put it through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions over what we talked about last year or last quarter, excuse me, and you take that and what happens in many businesses when the economic environment gets tough is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio so that the overall sort of mix of the company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset the $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation and that's still our expectation. So that is a very high level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes, but that's the overall thought process, and you take that and that is the reduction in the guidance essentially."

But we also put a range on our guidance, so -- and the guidance is to be very clear. The guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It's not a conservative estimate. It's what we really believe is going to happen. And if things do get a little weaker, we're going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little bit stronger, we're going to be at the high-end of guidance. So we think we got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do. But with our best people and our best thought process and it's fairly consistent with what other companies are saying. The only release that I saw that hinted at improvement in oil and gas at the latter part of this year was in GE's report.

And it comes back to one of the original or initial questions that you don't want to destroy these businesses, these are phenomenal businesses and you don't want to go in and take so much cost out that you then will not be able to recoup. So we think we've done the appropriate amount, we're pleased with it. You can see it in the overall performance of the company. And we're talking about earnings being down here, if you take the average of our estimates, about 32%. So it's not like we're going to be down 10% or 15% on earnings. So we're actually pretty happy with that, although I know it's not good from the change in guidance point."

So I guess my question is, one of your 4 operational model points, lays of the chair, if you will, is in fact new products and has there been thought given to maybe finding a way to bump up the cost reduction target a little bit more to let's say fund a little bit more organic growth? Because there's got to be some reason why the organic has been kind of weak for really 6 quarters now.

If you look at the organic growth of AMETEK, Kevin has done this analysis over the last, almost any periods you pick, say a year, 3 years, 5 years and it even has a 10 year chart, our organic growth lines up quite well with our peers. But obviously, when you've got the impact of these 2 market conditions that I'm talking about, it's not -- just not -- you can't overcome that. It's basically what happens. Your number, if you really look at it, isn't as significant as you think. It's not a 4% to 5%. It's a lower number than that. But it's running slightly negative, I would say, for the rest of the company and that's what's in our guidance. But the overwhelming impact is really from those 2 areas, and that'll change when those markets change. So in terms of tweaking the model, yes, we do that all the time and as I mentioned to Allyson's question, that's why we're keeping the RD&E expense up when the top line is weak.

EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against the difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business",524,"Sure, Scott, I'd be glad to do that. So let me start with EIG. EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against the difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter, but it was offset by difficult comparison in our business and regional business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, again, driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. Our process businesses, organic sales and process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting, obviously, what we've talked about in terms of greater than expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push outs also impacted our mid-and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our process businesses to be down mid-single digits organically. And the last part of the EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter. Overall sales are up 10% driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Organic sales were down low single digits and for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be done a mid-single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we're expecting overall sales to be roughly flat and that's obviously driven by the acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX with organic sales down to mid-single digit kind of region. Moving to the other half of the company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our engineered materials and interconnect and packaging business and the weakness, as I've already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, we do expect sequential improvement over the rest of 2016 and we're really facing that on current order trends, which have had strengthened and thus, we really do expect the stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of software global market conditions and for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those 2 parts of EMG. So overall, then, for EMG, we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you saw EIG and EMG and that's where we get to the flat overall sales and organic sales down in the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis."

Can you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now of what size and then ultimately, how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments how you're looking at a variety of deals and then clearly, there's some priority all things being equal to do a larger deal, could you talk about that particularly the context of I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound in your capacity right now?"

If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at the size of deal that we are focused on, it's really between in volume between $50 million and a couple hundred million dollars and if a larger deal comes along up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we would consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we have discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve, on a yearly basis -- it's not going to be every year, but on average, 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that's the basic model we've talked about for years, you take the upper end of that and it's $400 million, right? We're $4 billion right now, so we're going to take the  upper end, 10%, you need to do $400 million in a volume and there's different ways you could say what's the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.5 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy, they got to deploy $800 million a year in capital, on average to make -- to get to the high end of that range. What's our capacity? Right now, our capacity is, with everything we've got, we are well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow where our CapEx at around $70 million is around $700 million, so -- and when you buy companies, you got an EBITDA upstream. So basically, we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably $1.3 billion at the numbers recently without affecting significantly the leverage of the company. We will remain investment grade. That's an absolutely our thrust. We don't intend to flow equity. We don't need to based on the numbers that I just told you. So we're in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity from a management viewpoint, the way we have put the -- made changes in the company, really, over the last number of years, is to basically put enough resource in the company, which is already there now, it's already done so that we can handle 3 deals a year -- or 3 deals, simultaneously, excuse me. And if you take on average, how long it takes to do a deal, you could easily do 10  deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is, we don't have to do that larger deal. We can get that $400 million number by doing a bunch of small deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something and we looked at a few and we're actually very close on, one of the best larger we will do that. So we're not management constrained. We are not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we've got a lot of effort going in. The backlog is good. We're looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can't tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we're fairly optimistic that we're going to do well. And that's the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the company and create value for you. So I don't know if I answered your question, I try to bundle them all together, but is that good?"

It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about and for some of our mature businesses, where we've already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on targeting to build material from an engineering view point so we've taken our building materials, focused on the highest cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that. And very quickly, go through projects and we're introducing cost out designs in a matter 3 or 6 months. And we've done that across the company and we've institutionalized it as one of our Operational Excellence tools and now it's the largest driver of our material cost savings, so if you think about it, we bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big saving. Often it can 25% out of the company's material cost because of our global sourcing. While we've owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we had to find other avenues to take material cost out and that's where the value analysis, value engineering comes in and institutionalize across the whole business and as I mentioned, it's the largest driver of the material cost now so wer'e very happy about that."

The second thing is that, in one of our oil and gas division's thermal process management, they have actually one market share with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog and they've done that, really, through several initiatives. The first was increase penetration in the Middle East and also a partnership that we have with [indiscernible]. So the first factor is, we expect the process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors.The second factor is, what we've already talked about in terms of EMIT, that we believe that situation and we are already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year and therefore, we will see incremental improvements from that volume and we're very confident in that.

So you've got to be careful on that side of the equation. So we always put cycles in our acquisition models. We actually have an approach Monte Carlo analysis and change the magnitude of the cycles, change the timing of the cycles, et cetera, so that we make sure that we're paying the correct amount for the assets."

I mean, that's a great point and if you recall what I said in one of the questions at that somebody asked in this meeting, right around the time we released guidance, I don't remember exactly when oil hit $26 a barrel, but we were starting to feel that. And so therefore, when I came out or we came out with guidance a quarter ago, I pushed you towards the low end and I did that because of the concern that did in fact materialize. Actually, I don't think I've ever done that before in my 16 you being the CEO. Normally, we come out with a very balanced view of the guidance, not the to push it one way or the other. And as I've already mentioned on this call, the guidance we're giving you now is balanced. Another words, we think there's as much upside potential as there is downside risk. So if things are weaker than what I'm saying, you could end up at the low end. If things are better, you're going to be at the high-end. So it's a balanced view. And it's not weighted in either of the direction. And so -- which is much more consistent with what we've done in the past."

31860,331029476,966748,"Ametek Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","AMETEK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.

AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we are seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets.  
These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remain confident in the long-term positioning and growth prospects for our business. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. 
Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter.
Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57, or down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance. Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.  
Now turning to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter, organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield Engineering and ESP/SurgeX contributed 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process businesses, which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We are seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream and in the mid and downstream markets.  
EIG's operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, the acquisition of Global Tubes added 6% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact in commodity price deflation and our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business as well as from soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. 
EMG's operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
I'll now provide some updates on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We are focused on consistently executing on each of these strategies over the business cycle. However, in slow growth environments, we increased our focus on Strategic Acquisitions and Operational Excellence initiatives, while ensuring we continue to make targeted investments in research and development in global expansion.  
First, let me touch on acquisitions. We've got a good start to the year, acquiring 2 business in the first quarter: Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.
ESP/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their patent protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, project, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina. 
Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They are headquartered in Middleborough, Massachusetts, with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India; and have annual sales of approximately $55 million.
The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first 6 months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration.
Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active and so we are quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value.
Now turning to Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees are doing a great job driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tools.
Our Operational Excellence initiatives take on even greater importance and become more of a focus in slow growth environments. For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total Operational Excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic impairment initiatives, driving approximately $60 million of the total savings. The total Operational Excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams.
Now moving on to new products. We're pleased with the continued success of our new product development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding and existing markets and penetrating adjacent markets.
Despite the slow growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our new product development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year.
We continue to see excellent results from this investment as our vitality index, which measures revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years, was 22% of sales in the quarter. We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The new XEPOS energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact, benchtop unit incorporates a number of advances that allow it to perform rapid, multielement analysis, with greater accuracy and precision.
The instrument's enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research as well as precise outline quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing and pharmaceutical production.  
The new and extreme performance series of MIL-XTM Fans from AMETEK Rotron delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military aerospace and industrial environments. The new fans features shockproof, MIL spec construction and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone or stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks and personnel and airborne, land-based and seaborne installations. 
Our Zygo business provided high-precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitational waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein's 1915 General Theory of Relativity. The international team of scientist that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced LIGO detectors that incorporated very high precision optical components manufactured by Zygo. The optics manufactured to some sub-nanometer tolerances are among the most precise optics ever made. I'd like to recognize the Zygo team on their contribution to the success of this important, global, scientific project. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence in attractive higher growth regions in market segments through continued investments in our sales and service capabilities and through the expansion of our technology into new, adjacent market segments. 
I want to highlight one recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. Our process instruments business has pioneered near infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production. The process instruments business is now adapting the TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing through modifying its existing Model 5100 series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drawing.
The use of this technology as an online analysis tool allows manufacturers to obtain a clear picture of the drawing process in real-time. It is an economical and efficient technique for determining dryer endpoint detection since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze and restart the drying process.
The Process Instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology.
Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end-market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015, with organic sales down low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2015. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year.
Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter.
In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes deploying capital on strategic acquisitions; making growth investments in new product development and global expansion; and executing on our operational excellence initiatives.
Our strong cash flow and proven operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details. And then, we will be glad to take your questions."

In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales.  
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 28.1% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives.
For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from its full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority.
Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. 
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income.  
The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisition of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million.  
Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio for March 31 of 35.7%.  
At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increasing the size of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million, and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a large financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

The key issue is that we have exposure on both sides of our company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our company and we have just seen, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas in terms of the downturn last year, when we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on and the conditions are worse. If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought, for 2016, with respect to 2015, we'd be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million and that changed. There was an inflection point, actually, right around the time of our last earnings call when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happens, we just saw a large number of projects just move to the right and -- that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen, but they're going to be moved and probably moved, many of them into next year. So we missed all that particular business and is simply because the changes have been so dramatic and it's very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we're operating the company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing. And I would say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company, with EMIP, with the issue with metals pricing and the deflation that happened when we talked about this in the fourth quarter, in a way, a similar thing happened, that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remained soft through the first quarter. And now the good news in that particular market is we are starting to feel improvements. We're -- actually, our order intake is improving so we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we're not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is, really, a market-related issue with dramatic changes on each side of the company that's causing this problem. Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we're actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We've met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good. One of the better ones in the industry. So we're managing a difficult situation as well as, I believe, anybody could manage it. So -- but that's fundamentally what's happened. I hope that helps."

I guess prices offset the inflation by a modest amount, still. And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So when I think about -- when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that, probably, for the last 4 or 5 quarters, and clearly that didn't materialize, but I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS to the -- to your new guidance of -- the new guidance range that you provided today."

The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at for the year, we think we -- and our guidance assumes that we're going to be 2 points less on organic growth and that's as a result of the 2 factors predominantly that I talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that's $80 million. $80 million, the detrimental -- decremental, excuse me -- they are detrimental too, I guess. Decremental margins of this company, similarly to when they -- when volume goes up on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it, I'll take -- make the numbers easy, 50%. You got $40 million of pretax operating income and that's $0.12 or $0.13 a share. Yes, we haven't put it through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions over what we talked about last year or last quarter, excuse me, and you take that and what happens in many businesses when the economic environment gets tough is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio so that the overall sort of mix of the company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset that $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation and that's still our expectation. So that is a very high level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes, but that's the overall thought process, and you take that and that is the reduction in the guidance essentially."

But we also put a range on our guidance, so -- and the guidance, just to be very clear. The guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It's not a conservative estimate. It's what we really believe is going to happen. And if things do get a little weaker, we're going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little bit stronger, we're going to be at the high-end of the guidance. So we think we got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do. But with our best people and our best thought process and it's fairly consistent with what other companies are saying.

EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter, but it was offset by difficult comparison in our business and regional jet business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, again, driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. Our process businesses, organic sales and process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting, obviously, what we've talked about in terms of greater than expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push outs also impacted our mid- and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our process businesses to be down mid-single digits organically. And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter. Overall sales are up 10% driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Organic sales were down low single digits and for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down a mid-single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we're expecting overall sales to be roughly flat and that's obviously driven by the acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX, with organic sales down to mid-single digit kind of region. Moving to the other half of the company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business, and the weakness, as I've already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, here, we do expect sequential improvements over the rest of 2016 and we're really facing that on current order trends, which have -- have strengthened and thus, we really do expect a stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of softer global market conditions and for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those 2 parts of EMG. So overall, then, for EMG, we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you saw EIG and EMG and that's where we get to the flat overall sales and organic sales down the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis."

I mean, one question that has come up from an investor is just thinking about, maybe drilling down on this question about size of deal. I think investors have been concerned about perhaps in the context of a lower structural organic growth and some of the challenges there, that doing a larger deal is kind of a priority just given the law of large numbers. Can you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now of what size and then, ultimately, how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments how you're looking at a variety of deals and then clearly, there's a priority, all things being equal, to do a larger deal. But could you just -- could you talk about that particularly in the context of -- I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound in your capacity right now?"
31860,331029476,966748,"Ametek Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","AMETEK, Inc.","Executives","Yes, sure. You got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at t",676,"Yes, sure. You got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at the size of deal that we are focused on, it's really between -- in volume between $50 million and a couple of hundred million dollars and if a larger deal comes along up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we would consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we have discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve, on a yearly basis -- it's not going to be every year, but on average, 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that's the basic model we've talked about for years. You take the upper end of that and it's $400 million, right? We're $4 billion right now. So you're going to take the upper end of 10%, you need to do $400 million in a volume and there's different ways you can say what's the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.5 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy, you've got to deploy $800 million a year in capital, on average to make -- to get to the high end of that range. What's our capacity? Right now, our capacity is, with everything we've got, we are well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow of the company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow with our CapEx at around $70 million is around $700 million, so -- and when you buy companies, you got an EBITDA upstream. So basically, we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably $1.3 billion at the numbers recently without affecting significantly the leverage of the company. We will remain investment grade. That's absolutely our thrust. We don't intend to flow equity. We don't need to, based on the numbers that I just told you. So we're in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity from a management viewpoint, the way we have put the -- made changes in the company, really, over the last number of years, is to basically put enough resource in the company, which is already there now, it's already done. So that we can handle 3 deals a year -- or 3 deals, simultaneously, excuse me. And if you take on average, how long it takes to do a deal, that means, you could easily do 10 deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is, we don't have to do that larger deal. We can get that $400 million number by doing a bunch of small deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something and we've looked at a few and we're actually very close on one a few quarters ago that we [indiscernible]. That's larger, we will do that. So we're not management constrained. We're not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we've got a lot of effort going in. And if the backlog is good. We're looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can't tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we're fairly optimistic that we're going to do well. And that's the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the company and create value for you. So I don't know if I've answered all of your questions. I tried to bundle them all together, but does get at them?"

And therefore, that's an ongoing cost. In terms of any, what I would call, major restructuring of the company, no, we're not envisioning that. And we have to modify these strategies as time goes on. And I'd give you an example, and Dave, maybe you can speak to this.

It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about and for some of our mature businesses, where we've already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on targeting to build material from an engineering view point. So we've taken our building materials, focused on the highest cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that. And very quickly, go through projects and we're introducing cost out designs in a matter 3 or 6 months. And we've done that across the company and we've institutionalized it as one of our Operational Excellence tools and now it's the largest driver of our material cost savings. So if you think about it, would it bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big savings. We often can take 25% out of a company's material cost because of our global sourcing. While we've owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we had to find other avenues to take material cost out and that's where the value analysis, value engineering comes in and now has institutionalized across the whole business. And as I mentioned, this is the largest driver of the material cost now. So we're very happy about that."

The good news is that we're feeling a stabilization in China, and if you look at the numbers we've provided over the last 3 quarters on China, they're not the best in the world, but the key thing is the orders in the first quarter were flat organically. So -- and in talking with our people there, they are feeling a bit of stabilization, I would say, is probably the best word. So we're feeling a little bit better about China.

We feel pretty comfortable as we move through the year in terms of the improvements and I'm going to talk of sort of about the overall improvements in EPS. And there's 3 drivers for this. The first is that in our process businesses, there's a seasonality impact of several of our non-oil and gas related businesses, where they always have a stronger second half than first half. The second thing is that, in one of our oil and gas division's thermal process managements, they have actually won market share with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog and they've done that, really, through several initiatives. The first was increase penetration in the Middle East and also a partnership that we have with Pentair. So the first factor is, we expect the process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors.The second factor is, what we've already talked about in terms of EMIP, that we believe that, that situation and we're already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year and therefore, we will see incremental improvements from that volume and we're very confident in that. And then the third thing is, really, the cost improvements. And if you look at how the cost improvements layer in, they become much more significant in the latter quarters in the year. So you take the organic growth of the first 2 reasons I outlined and obviously, when that goes to the bottom line, that improves your margins because of our very high contribution margins and then you put these incremental cost improvements through the business, that's why we feel those margins will, in fact, improve.

AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we are seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets.  
These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remain confident in the long-term positioning and growth prospects for our business. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. 
Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter.
Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance. Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.  
Now turning to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter. Organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield Engineering and ESP/SurgeX contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process businesses, which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We are seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream and in the mid and downstream markets.  
EIG's operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, the acquisition of Global Tubes added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business as well as from soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. 
EMG's operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter, and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
I'll now provide some updates on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We are focused on consistently executing on each of these strategies over the business cycle. However, in slow-growth environments, we increase our focus on Strategic Acquisitions and Operational Excellence initiatives, while ensuring we continue to make targeted investments in research and development in global expansion.  
First, let me touch on acquisitions. We've got a good start to the year, acquiring 2 business in the first quarter: Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.
ESP/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their patent-protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina. 
Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They are headquartered in Middleborough, Massachusetts, with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India, and have annual sales of approximately $55 million.
The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first 6 months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy, as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration.
Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active, and so we are quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value.
Now turning to Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees are doing a great job driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tools.
Our Operational Excellence initiatives take on even greater importance and become more of a focus in slow-growth environments. For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total Operational Excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic impairment initiatives, driving approximately $60 million of the total savings. The total Operational Excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams.
Now moving on to New Products. We're pleased with the continued success of our New Product Development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding in existing markets and penetrating adjacent markets.
Despite the slow-growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our New Product Development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year.
We continue to see excellent results from this investment as our vitality index, which measures revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years, was 22% of sales in the quarter. We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The new XEPOS energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact, benchtop unit incorporates a number of advances that allow it to perform rapid, multielement analysis, with greater accuracy and precision.
The instrument's enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research as well as precise at-line quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing and pharmaceutical production.  
The new and extreme performance series of MIL-XTM Fans from AMETEK Rotron delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military, aerospace and industrial environments. The new fans feature shockproof, MIL-spec construction and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone or stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks and personnel in airborne, land-based and seaborne installations. 
Our Zygo business provided high-precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitational waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein's 1915 General Theory of Relativity. The international team of scientists that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced LIGO detectors that incorporated very high-precision optical components manufactured by Zygo. The optics, manufactured to some sub-nanometer tolerances, are among the most precise optics ever made. I'd like to recognize the Zygo team on their contribution to the success of this important, global, scientific project. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence in attractive higher-growth regions and market segments through continued investments in our sales and service capabilities and through the expansion of our technology into new, adjacent market segments. 
I want to highlight one recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. Our Process Instruments business has pioneered near-infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production. The Process Instruments business is now adapting the TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing through modifying its existing Model 5100 series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drying.
The use of this technology as an online analysis tool allows manufacturers to obtain a clear picture of the drying process in real-time. It is an economical and efficient technique for determining dryer endpoint detection since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze and restart the drying process.
The Process Instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology.
Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end-market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015, with organic sales down low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2015. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year.
Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter.
In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes deploying capital on strategic acquisitions, making growth investments in new product development and global expansion, and executing on our Operational Excellence initiatives.
Our strong cash flow and proven operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details. And then, we will be glad to take your questions."

In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales.  
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 28.1% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives.
For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from its full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority.
Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. 
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income.  
The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisition of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million.  
Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio for March 31 of 35.7%.  
At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increasing the size of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million, and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a large financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

Just thinking about how you're thinking when you go into the planning process for guidance, what is it that's changed that it's becoming a lot more difficult to guide in this market? We know, obviously, things are difficult, but we're not used to AMETEK falling short, like it has over the last few quarters. Have you cut it too close to the bone, potentially, where it's becoming a little bit more difficult to guard against some of the shocks in the market?

The key issue is that we have exposure on both sides of our company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our company and we have just seen, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas in terms of the downturn last year. When we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on and the conditions are worse. If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought, for 2016, with respect to 2015, we'd be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million, and that changed. There was an inflection point, actually, right around the time of our last earnings call when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happens, we just saw a large number of projects just move to the right and -- that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen, but they're going to be moved and probably moved, many of them, into next year. So we mis-called that particular business, and it's simply because the changes have been so dramatic and it's very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we're operating the company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing. And I would say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company, with EMIP, with the issue with metals pricing and the deflation that happened, and we talked about this in the fourth quarter, in a way, a similar thing happened, that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remained soft through the first quarter. And now the good news in that particular market is we are starting to feel improvements. We're -- actually, our order intake is improving, so we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we're not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is, really, a market-related issue with dramatic changes on each side of the company that's causing this problem. Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we're actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We've met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good. One of the better ones in the industry. So we're managing a difficult situation as well as, I believe, anybody could manage it. So -- but that's fundamentally what's happened. I hope that helps."

I presume there hasn't been a change in the assumption on price and inflation. I guess prices offset the inflation by a modest amount, still. And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So when I think about -- when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that, probably, for the last 4 or 5 quarters, and clearly that didn't materialize, but I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS to the -- to your new guidance of -- the new guidance range that you provided today."

The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at for the year, we think we -- and our guidance assumes that we're going to be 2 points less on organic growth, and that's as a result of the 2 factors, predominantly, that I talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that's $80 million. $80 million, the detrimental -- decremental, excuse me -- they are detrimental too, I guess. Decremental margins of this company, similarly to when they -- when volume goes up, are on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it, I'll take -- make the numbers easy, 50%. You got $40 million of pretax operating income, and that's $0.12 or $0.13 a share. Yes, we have been putting through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions over what we talked about last year -- or last quarter, excuse me. And you take that, and what happens in many businesses when the economic environment gets tough is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio so that the overall sort of mix of the company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset that $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation, and that's still our expectation. So that is a very high-level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes, but that's the overall thought process, and you take that and that is the reduction in the guidance, essentially."

But we also put a range on our guidance, so -- and the guidance, just to be very clear, the guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It's not a conservative estimate. It's what we really believe is going to happen. And if things do get a little weaker, we're going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little bit stronger, we're going to be at the high-end of the guidance. So we think we got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do. But with our best people and our best thought process -- and it's really consistent with what other companies are saying.

And has there been thought given to maybe finding a way to bump up the cost-reduction target a little bit more to let's say fund a little bit more organic growth?

But it's running slightly negative, I would say, for the rest of the company and that's what's in our guidance. But the overwhelming impact is really from those 2 areas, and that'll change when those markets change. So in terms of tweaking the model, yes, we do that all the time. And as I mentioned to Allison's question, that's why we're keeping the RD&E expense up when the top line is weak.

EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business i",525,"Sure, Scott, I'd be glad to do that. So let me start with EIG. EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter, but it was offset by a difficult comparison in our business and regional jet business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, again, driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. Our Process businesses, organic sales in Process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting, obviously, what we've talked about in terms of greater-than-expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push-outs also impacted our mid- and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our Process businesses to be down mid-single digits organically. And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter. Overall sales are up 10%, driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Organic sales were down low single digits and for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down a mid-single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we're expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, and that's obviously driven by the acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX, with organic sales down a mid-single digit kind of a region. Moving to the other half of the company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business. And the weakness, as I've already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, here, we do expect sequential improvements over the rest of 2016 and we're really facing that on current order trends, which have strengthened and thus, we really do expect a stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of softer global market conditions. And for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those 2 parts of EMG. So overall, then, for EMG, we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you still have EIG and EMG, and that's where we get to the flat overall sales and organic sales down the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis."

Can you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now, of what size, and then, ultimately, how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments how you're looking at a variety of deals and then clearly, there's a priority, all things being equal, to do a larger deal. But could you just -- could you talk about that, particularly in the context of -- I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound in your capacity right now?"

Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at t",681,"Yes, sure. You got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at the size of deal that we are focused on, it's really between -- in volume between $50 million and a couple of hundred million dollars. And if a larger deal comes along up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we would consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we have discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve, on a yearly basis -- it's not going to be every year, but on average, 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that's the basic model we've talked about for years. You take the upper end of that and it's $400 million, right? We're $4 billion right now. So you're going to take the upper end, 10%, you need to do $400 million in a volume. And there's different ways you can say what's the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.5 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy. You've got to deploy $800 million a year in capital, on average, to make -- to get to the high end of that range. What's our capacity? Right now, our capacity is, with everything we've got, we are well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow of the company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow with our CapEx at around $70 million is around $700 million, so -- and when you buy companies, you get an EBITDA stream. So basically, we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably $1.3 billion -- I haven't run the numbers recently -- without affecting significantly the leverage of the company. We will remain investment grade. That's absolutely our thrust. We don't intend to float equity. We don't need to, based on the numbers that I just told you. So we're in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity from a management viewpoint, the way we have put the -- made changes in the company, really, over the last number of years, is to basically put enough resource in the company, which is already there now, it's already done, so that we can handle 3 deals a year -- or 3 deals, simultaneously, excuse me. And if you take on average, how long it takes to do a deal, that means you could easily do 10 deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is, we don't have to do that larger deal. We can get that $400 million number by doing a bunch of small deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something -- and we've looked at a few and we were actually very close on one a few quarters ago that we [indiscernible] -- that's larger, we will do that. So we're not management constrained. We're not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint, and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we've got a lot of effort going in. And the backlog is good. We're looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can't tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we're fairly optimistic that we're going to do well. And that's the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the company and create value for you. So I don't know if I've answered all of your questions. I tried to bundle them all together, but does get at them?"

We've put the infrastructure in the company to do that and we believe that can continue for a substantial amount of time. And the majority of that is sort of built in to our revenue and our guidance as we give it to you guys and ladies. And the reason for that is the structure that we have put in place. As you know, we are an operationally-focused company, so in terms of just our normal Operational Excellence strategies, we can get $50 million to $70 million a year, and in terms of our materials strategy, we're in that same ballpark. And therefore, that's an ongoing cost. In terms of any, what I would call, major restructuring of the company, no, we're not envisioning that. And we have to modify these strategies as time goes on. And I'll give you an example, and Dave, maybe you can speak to this. On the material side, we had to change the strategy a bit and we've done it incrementally over the last number of years and we've added a value analysis tool into our toolbox. And Dave, why don't you speak to that a little bit. You've really led that activity and done a great job with it."

It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about. And for some of our mature businesses, where we've already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on targeting the bill of material from an engineering viewpoint. So we've taken our bill of materials, focused on the highest-cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that. And very quickly go through projects, and we're introducing cost-out designs in a matter 3 or 6 months. And we've done that across the company and we've institutionalized it as one of our Operational Excellence tools, and now it's the largest driver of our material cost savings. So if you think about it, when we bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big savings. We often can take 25% out of a company's material cost because of our global sourcing. While if we've owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we had to find other avenues to take material cost out and that's where the value analysis, value engineering comes in, and now that's institutionalized across the whole business. And as I mentioned, this is the largest driver of the material cost now. So we're very happy about that."

But, obviously, the driver here is China. And I should mention, India is good. That's the one that was good last quarter and it remains good. We had mid-single-digit kind of organic growth in India. The good news is that we're feeling a stabilization in China. And if you look at the numbers we've provided over the last 3 quarters on China, they're not the best in the world, but the key thing is the orders in the first quarter were flat organically. So -- and in talking with our people there, they are feeling a bit of stabilization, I would say, is probably the best word. So we're feeling a little bit better about China. But obviously, the BRIC countries, which, for a while for us, were growing at 25%, 30% overall, are now more of a challenge. But hopefully, what we saw in orders in China is an indication that things are going to get better there."

So we don't have an impact on our cost because we pass basically the price of the raw material on. So we're not sort of -- we don't have an issue from that viewpoint. The issue from us is when metal prices are very low, our customers are just going to hold off as long as they possibly can and -- before they start buying.

We feel pretty comfortable as we move through the year in terms of the improvements, and I'm going to talk of sort of about the overall improvements in EPS. And there's 3 drivers for this. The first is that in our Process businesses, there's a seasonality impact of several of our non-oil and gas-related businesses, where they always have a stronger second half than first half. The second thing is that, in one of our oil and gas divisions, thermal process management, they have actually won market share, with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog. And they've done that, really, through several initiatives. The first was increased penetration in the Middle East and also a partnership that we have with Pentair. So the first factor is, we expect the Process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors. The second factor is what we've already talked about in terms of EMIP, that we believe that, that situation, and we're already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year and therefore, we will see incremental improvements from that volume, and we're very confident in that. And then the third thing is, really, the cost improvements. And if you look at how the cost improvements layer in, they become much more significant in the latter quarters in the year. So you take the organic growth of the first 2 reasons I outlined and obviously, when that goes to the bottom line, that improves your margins because of our very high contribution margins. And then you put these incremental cost improvements through the business, that's why we feel those margins will, in fact, improve. Does that help?"

But I think it's reasonable to assume that it's going to get back to a healthier level. So we're not afraid to buy assets. And you can get extremely -- potentially extremely good pricing because you got businesses in distress. And -- but it's not -- I wouldn't say we're focused on oil and gas, and I don't think I said that. I just said we -- we're not afraid to buy a business in the down cycle. Actually you have there almost a reverse problem. If you're in a very strong up cycle and you look at the sellers who are selling that business, they of course will take where they are at the top of the cycle and say they're going to grow organically from that point and they'll never put a cycle -- down cycle in their estimates. So you've got to be careful on that side of the equation. So we always put cycles in our acquisition models. We actually have an approach where we can do Monte Carlo analysis and change the magnitudes of the cycles, change the timing of the cycles, et cetera, so that we make sure we're paying the correct amount for the assets."

Actually, I don't think I've ever done that before in my 16 years of being a CEO. Normally, we come out with a very balanced view on the guidance, not trying to push it one way or the other. And as I've already mentioned on this call, the guidance we're giving you now is balanced. In other words, we think there's as much upside potential as there is downside risk. So if things are weaker than what I'm saying, you could end up at the low end. If things are better, you're going to be at the high end. So it's a balanced view.

AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we are seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets.  
These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remain confident in the long-term positioning and growth prospects for our business. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. 
Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter.
Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter of $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance. Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.  
Now turning to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter. Organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield Engineering and ESP/SurgeX contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process businesses, which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We are seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream and in the mid and downstream markets.  
EIG's operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, the acquisition of Global Tubes added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business as well as from soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. 
EMG's operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter, and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
I'll now provide some updates on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We are focused on consistently executing on each of these strategies over the business cycle. However, in slow-growth environments, we increase our focus on Strategic Acquisitions and Operational Excellence initiatives, while ensuring we continue to make targeted investments in research and development in global expansion.  
First, let me touch on acquisitions. We've got a good start to the year, acquiring 2 business in the first quarter: Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.
ESP/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their patent-protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission-critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina. 
Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They are headquartered in Middleborough, Massachusetts, with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India, and have annual sales of approximately $55 million.
The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first 6 months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy, as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration.
Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active, and so we are quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value.
Now turning to Operational Excellence. Our management teams and employees are doing a great job driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tools.
Our Operational Excellence initiatives take on even greater importance and become more of a focus in slow-growth environments. For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total Operational Excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic impairment initiatives, driving approximately $60 million of the total savings. The total Operational Excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams.
Now moving on to New Products. We're pleased with the continued success of our New Product Development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding in existing markets and penetrating adjacent markets.
Despite the slow-growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our New Product Development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year.
We continue to see excellent results from this investment as our vitality index, which measures revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years, was 22% of sales in the quarter. We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The new XEPOS energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact, benchtop unit incorporates a number of advances that allow it to perform rapid, multielement analysis, with greater accuracy and precision.
The instrument's enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research as well as precise at-line quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing and pharmaceutical production.  
The new and extreme performance series of MIL-XTM Fans from AMETEK Rotron delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military, aerospace and industrial environments. The new fans feature shockproof, MIL-spec construction and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone or stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks and personnel in airborne, land-based and seaborne installations. 
Our Zygo business provided high-precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitational waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein's 1915 General Theory of Relativity. The international team of scientists that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced LIGO detectors that incorporated very high-precision optical components manufactured by Zygo. The optics, manufactured to some sub-nanometer tolerances, are among the most precise optics ever made. I'd like to recognize the Zygo team on their contribution to the success of this important, global, scientific project. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence in attractive higher-growth regions and market segments through continued investments in our sales and service capabilities and through the expansion of our technology into new, adjacent market segments. 
I want to highlight one recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. Our Process Instruments business has pioneered near-infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production. The Process Instruments business is now adapting the TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing through modifying its existing Model 5100 series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drying.
The use of this technology as an online analysis tool allows manufacturers to obtain a clear picture of the drying process in real-time. It is an economical and efficient technique for determining dryer endpoint detection since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze and restart the drying process.
The Process Instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology.
Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end-market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015, with organic sales down low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2015. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year.
Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter.
In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes deploying capital on strategic acquisitions, making growth investments in new product development and global expansion, and executing on our Operational Excellence initiatives.
Our strong cash flow and proven operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details. And then, we will be glad to take your questions."

In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales.  
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 28.1% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives.
For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from its full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority.
Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. 
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income.  
The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisition of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX. In addition, in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million.  
Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio for March 31 of 35.7%.  
At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increasing the size of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million, and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a large financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives."

So Q1 marks this -- maybe the second or third quarter in a row where you fell short of expectations on an operational basis. Just thinking about how you're thinking when you go into the planning process for guidance, what is it that's changed that it's becoming a lot more difficult to guide in this market? We know, obviously, things are difficult, but we're not used to AMETEK falling short, like it has over the last few quarters. Have you cut it too close to the bone, potentially, where it's becoming a little bit more difficult to guard against some of the shocks in the market? Or are there other issues at play that you could maybe discuss?"

The key issue is that we have exposure on both sides of our company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our company and we have just seen, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas in terms of the downturn last year. When we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on and the conditions are worse. If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought, for 2016, with respect to 2015, we'd be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million, and that changed. There was an inflection point, actually, right around the time of our last earnings call when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happens, we just saw a large number of projects just move to the right and -- that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen, but they're going to be moved and probably moved, many of them, into next year. So we mis-called that particular business, and it's simply because the changes have been so dramatic and it's very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we're operating the company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing. And I would say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company, with EMIP, with the issue with metals pricing and the deflation that happened, and we talked about this in the fourth quarter, in a way, a similar thing happened, that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remained soft through the first quarter. And now the good news in that particular market is we are starting to feel improvements. We're -- actually, our order intake is improving, so we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we're not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is, really, a market-related issue with dramatic changes on each side of the company that's causing this problem. Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we're actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We've met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good. One of the better ones in the industry. So we're managing a difficult situation as well as, I believe, anybody could manage it. So -- but that's fundamentally what's happened. I hope that helps."

When I just look at your bridge, talking about flat sales for the year, obviously, 4, 5, 6 percentage points of acquisition contribution, organic down. I presume there hasn't been a change in the assumption on price and inflation. I guess prices offset the inflation by a modest amount, still. And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So when I think about -- when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that, probably, for the last 4 or 5 quarters, and clearly that didn't materialize, but I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS to the -- to your new guidance of -- the new guidance range that you provided today."

The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at for the year, we think we -- and our guidance assumes that we're going to be 2 points less on organic growth, and that's as a result of the 2 factors, predominantly, that I talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that's $80 million. $80 million, the detrimental -- decremental, excuse me -- they are detrimental too, I guess. Decremental margins of this company, similarly to when they -- when volume goes up, are on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it, I'll take -- make the numbers easy, 50%. You got $40 million of pretax operating income, and that's $0.12 or $0.13 a share. Yes, we have been putting through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions over what we talked about last year -- or last quarter, excuse me. And you take that, and what happens in many businesses when the economic environment gets tough is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio so that the overall sort of mix of the company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset that $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation, and that's still our expectation. So that is a very high-level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes, but that's the overall thought process, and you take that and that is the reduction in the guidance, essentially."

But we also put a range on our guidance, so -- and the guidance, just to be very clear, the guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It's not a conservative estimate. It's what we really believe is going to happen. And if things do get a little weaker, we're going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little bit stronger, we're going to be at the high-end of the guidance. So we think we got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do. But with our best people and our best thought process -- and it's really consistent with what other companies are saying.

So I guess my question is, one of your 4 operational model points, legs of the chair, if you will, is in fact new products. And has there been thought given to maybe finding a way to bump up the cost-reduction target a little bit more to let's say fund a little bit more organic growth?

If you look at the organic growth of AMETEK, Kevin has done this analysis over the last, almost any periods you pick, say a year, 3 years, 5 years and I think he even has a 10-year chart, our organic growth lines up quite well with our peers. But obviously, when you've got the impact of these 2 market conditions that I'm talking about, it's not -- just not -- you can't overcome that. It's basically what happens. Your number, if you really look at it, isn't as significant as you think. It's not a 4% to 5%. It's a lower number than that. But it's running slightly negative, I would say, for the rest of the company and that's what's in our guidance. But the overwhelming impact is really from those 2 areas, and that'll change when those markets change. So in terms of tweaking the model, yes, we do that all the time. And as I mentioned to Allison's question, that's why we're keeping the RD&E expense up when the top line is weak.

EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business i",525,"Sure, Scott, I'd be glad to do that. So let me start with EIG. EIG Aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year's first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter, but it was offset by a difficult comparison in our business and regional jet business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low to mid-single digits, again, driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. Our Process businesses, organic sales in Process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting, obviously, what we've talked about in terms of greater-than-expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push-outs also impacted our mid- and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our Process businesses to be down mid-single digits organically. And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter. Overall sales are up 10%, driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Organic sales were down low single digits and for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down a mid-single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we're expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, and that's obviously driven by the acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX, with organic sales down a mid-single digit kind of a region. Moving to the other half of the company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business. And the weakness, as I've already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, here, we do expect sequential improvements over the rest of 2016 and we're really facing that on current order trends, which have strengthened and thus, we really do expect a stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of softer global market conditions. And for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those 2 parts of EMG. So overall, then, for EMG, we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you still have EIG and EMG, and that's where we get to the flat overall sales and organic sales down the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis."

I think investors have been concerned about, perhaps in the context of lower structural organic growth and some of the challenges there, that doing a larger deal is kind of a priority just given the law of large numbers. Can you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now, of what size, and then, ultimately, how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments how you're looking at a variety of deals and then clearly, there's a priority, all things being equal, to do a larger deal. But could you just -- could you talk about that, particularly in the context of -- I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound in your capacity right now?"

Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at t",681,"Yes, sure. You got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we are not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don't create shareholder value. So when we look at the size of deal that we are focused on, it's really between -- in volume between $50 million and a couple of hundred million dollars. And if a larger deal comes along up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we would consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we have discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve, on a yearly basis -- it's not going to be every year, but on average, 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that's the basic model we've talked about for years. You take the upper end of that and it's $400 million, right? We're $4 billion right now. So you're going to take the upper end, 10%, you need to do $400 million in a volume. And there's different ways you can say what's the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.5 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy. You've got to deploy $800 million a year in capital, on average, to make -- to get to the high end of that range. What's our capacity? Right now, our capacity is, with everything we've got, we are well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow of the company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow with our CapEx at around $70 million is around $700 million, so -- and when you buy companies, you get an EBITDA stream. So basically, we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably $1.3 billion -- I haven't run the numbers recently -- without affecting significantly the leverage of the company. We will remain investment grade. That's absolutely our thrust. We don't intend to float equity. We don't need to, based on the numbers that I just told you. So we're in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity from a management viewpoint, the way we have put the -- made changes in the company, really, over the last number of years, is to basically put enough resource in the company, which is already there now, it's already done, so that we can handle 3 deals a year -- or 3 deals, simultaneously, excuse me. And if you take on average, how long it takes to do a deal, that means you could easily do 10 deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is, we don't have to do that larger deal. We can get that $400 million number by doing a bunch of small deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something -- and we've looked at a few and we were actually very close on one a few quarters ago that we [indiscernible] -- that's larger, we will do that. So we're not management constrained. We're not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint, and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we've got a lot of effort going in. And the backlog is good. We're looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can't tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we're fairly optimistic that we're going to do well. And that's the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the company and create value for you. So I don't know if I've answered all of your questions.

It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about. And for some of our mature businesses, where we've already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on targeting the bill of material from an engineering viewpoint. So we've taken our bill of materials, focused on the highest-cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that. And very quickly go through projects, and we're introducing cost-out designs in a matter 3 or 6 months. And we've done that across the company and we've institutionalized it as one of our Operational Excellence tools, and now it's the largest driver of our material cost savings. So if you think about it, when we bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big savings. We often can take 25% out of a company's material cost because of our global sourcing. While if we've owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we had to find other avenues to take material cost out and that's where the value analysis, value engineering comes in, and now that's institutionalized across the whole business.

If you look at the other countries, Russia continues to be weak. Brazil, weak. Well actually a little bit better than it was doing in terms of decremental organic growth versus last year. But, obviously, the driver here is China. And I should mention, India is good. That's the one that was good last quarter and it remains good. We had mid-single-digit kind of organic growth in India. The good news is that we're feeling a stabilization in China. And if you look at the numbers we've provided over the last 3 quarters on China, they're not the best in the world, but the key thing is the orders in the first quarter were flat organically. So -- and in talking with our people there, they are feeling a bit of stabilization, I would say, is probably the best word. So we're feeling a little bit better about China. But obviously, the BRIC countries, which, for a while for us, were growing at 25%, 30% overall, are now more of a challenge. But hopefully, what we saw in orders in China is an indication that things are going to get better there."

And if you actually looked at those 3 metals, they're down and they have not come back. And that's why, when they do come back, our customers -- right now, they don't want to buy when they're very low, right? So we don't have an impact on our cost because we pass basically the price of the raw material on. So we're not sort of -- we don't have an issue from that viewpoint. The issue from us is when metal prices are very low, our customers are just going to hold off as long as they possibly can and -- before they start buying. And that's what's really happening right now. And it was -- and the fact that those metals have not rebounded yet is the issue.

We feel pretty comfortable as we move through the year in terms of the improvements, and I'm going to talk of sort of about the overall improvements in EPS. And there's 3 drivers for this. The first is that in our Process businesses, there's a seasonality impact of several of our non-oil and gas-related businesses, where they always have a stronger second half than first half. The second thing is that, in one of our oil and gas divisions, thermal process management, they have actually won market share, with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog. And they've done that, really, through several initiatives. The first was increased penetration in the Middle East and also a partnership that we have with Pentair. So the first factor is, we expect the Process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors. The second factor is what we've already talked about in terms of EMIP, that we believe that, that situation, and we're already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year and therefore, we will see incremental improvements from that volume, and we're very confident in that. And then the third thing is, really, the cost improvements. And if you look at how the cost improvements layer in, they become much more significant in the latter quarters in the year. So you take the organic growth of the first 2 reasons I outlined and obviously, when that goes to the bottom line, that improves your margins because of our very high contribution margins. And then you put these incremental cost improvements through the business, that's why we feel those margins will, in fact, improve. Does that help?"

We believe oil and gas is going to be a good place to play on the longer term, and we are in a substantial down cycle. Now is oil going to get back to $125 a barrel? No, I don't think so. But I think it's reasonable to assume that it's going to get back to a healthier level. So we're not afraid to buy assets. And you can get extremely -- potentially extremely good pricing because you got businesses in distress. And -- but it's not -- I wouldn't say we're focused on oil and gas, and I don't think I said that. I just said we -- we're not afraid to buy a business in the down cycle. Actually you have there almost a reverse problem. If you're in a very strong up cycle and you look at the sellers who are selling that business, they of course will take where they are at the top of the cycle and say they're going to grow organically from that point and they'll never put a cycle -- down cycle in their estimates. So you've got to be careful on that side of the equation. So we always put cycles in our acquisition models. We actually have an approach where we can do Monte Carlo analysis and change the magnitudes of the cycles, change the timing of the cycles, et cetera, so that we make sure we're paying the correct amount for the assets."

Actually, I don't think I've ever done that before in my 16 years of being a CEO. Normally, we come out with a very balanced view on the guidance, not trying to push it one way or the other. And as I've already mentioned on this call, the guidance we're giving you now is balanced. In other words, we think there's as much upside potential as there is downside risk. So if things are weaker than what I'm saying, you could end up at the low end. If things are better, you're going to be at the high end. So it's a balanced view. And it's not weighted in either direction. And so -- which is much more consistent with what we've done in the past."

AMETEK delivered second quarter results that were in line with our expectation, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses in managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired 2 businesses, New Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers, and , a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I will talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.
Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%. Organic sales were down 7%, where acquisitions added 4%. The impact from in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from last year's second quarter. Free cash flow converged into net income was a strong 126%.
Now turning to the individual operating groups. 
First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 6%. Acquisitions contributed 6%. And foreign currency was flat. The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continued to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from its February lows, customers remain cautious. They continued to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated.
EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $152.1 million, and operating margins were strong 25.5%.
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%. Acquisitions contributed 2%. And foreign currency was flat. EMG sales remain pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials and packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our specialty metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected.
EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter, and operating margins were a solid 21%.
Now let me provide background on the 2 acquisitions we announced this morning. 
First, New Instruments. New Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometers used for elemental and isotropic analysis. News mass spectrometers utilized the magnetic field to separate isotopes of elements and over to analyze the material characterization of the sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within Earth and Environmental Sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. New is an excellent strategic fit with our advanced elemental analysis business.
New's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offering will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets are opening up opportunities to expand in new and attractive market segments. In addition, New will be able to leverage to strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.
New Instruments is headquartered in Brixton in the U.K. with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million.
The second acquisition is. H foils develops and produces key components used in radiation detectors. Each component includes ultrathin radiation windows, silicon drift detectors and x-ray filters. H is where it is technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with, unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology, as well as extensive knowledge in silicon pin and silicon drift detector manufacturing.
HS world technology will enable world-class instrument performance across many of our materials analysis businesses, including AMETEK, spectro and.
In addition, H operates out of a state-of-the-art semiconductor flat in Helsinki Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives.
With these 2 acquisitions, we have now deployed approximately $360 million capital and acquired over $150 million in revenue on 4 acquisitions so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.
Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013.
which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry's leader in standalone portable 3D scanners.
Free to form is optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within The Aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products and reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing.
Free to form has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition. Operating margins have more than doubled. Working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level of approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40% to now nearly 65%.
This new product capability has been an important driver of success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products which help them penetrate new markets and capture additional share in their existing markets.
Most recently, new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious best of the best award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 years, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world, so this is a great honor.
Specifically, products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new products recognize [indiscernible] 3D and the C.
Within Global & Market Expansion, the team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing the strong market presence and quality control in reverse engineering into new markets, such as nondestructive testing and healthcare. has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to the customer while also leveraging tran-9's global footprint to expand the direct sales activities in the U.S., Brazil and Southeast Asia.
I would like to congratulate the team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business through the execution of our growth strategies.
Now let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on the outlook for 2016. 
We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment given our mix of end market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas and metals market, have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year.
Visibility have remain limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels and capital spending plans.
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half.
As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low-single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits.
We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share.
In summary, we remain focused on executing our 4 growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We will continue to aggressively manage our business in the short term, while ensuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flows that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.
Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability. We have raised the cost structure, and we'll realize meaningful incremental margins as the current market headwinds subside.
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our our earnings expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end market conditions. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. 
In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27% as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter, and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $40 million -- $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million.
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter. And as a percent of net income, free cash flow was 126% for the second quarter, and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income.
Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 33.4%. At June 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow, with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, HS Foils and New Instruments, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million. And as well on the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million.
In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We are well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows.

In our Process businesses, they were very successful in expanding in the emerging markets, also very successful in the oil and gas market. So that is one point that we're seeing issues. Certainly, with the strong U.S. dollar when we're manufacturing in the U.S., we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low-cost locations. And in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that give us an advantage. But in terms of the translation and transaction affects, now we're in a relatively stable environment, we're not seeing much effect, and we are naturally hedged in most of our markets.

EIG Aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw a continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by a weakness in the business of regional jet market. For all of 2016,",528,"Sure, Rob. I'll start with EIG Aerospace. EIG Aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw a continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by a weakness in the business of regional jet market. For all of 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business in regional jets. This business continues to draw -- deliver strong new program wins. These wins are across a wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business in regional jets, military. And year-to-date, they have already won $230 million in program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market, and you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business. Next up segment will be Process. Organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by a weakness across our oil and gas business. Our ultra precision technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down mid to high-single digits, driven by the weakness in oil and gas. Going to the EIG Power & Industrial subsegment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits, driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back in 2016 for all of EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits. And if we switch to EMG, first, the differentiated parts of our EMG business. Organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by a continued weakness across our Engineered Materials interconnects and packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016. As a result, we expect second half sales across our EMG businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business, we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. And finally, our forecast in specialty motors business, although a small part of AMETEK, organic sales in our 4[ph] current specialty motors business were down low teens in the second quarter, a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016, we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically as a comparison eased to the back half of the year. So if you look at all EMG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits. And for AMETEK, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Hope that helps."

So we agreed that the environment is tough, but we're still getting it done. The second point is we're bullish on our pipeline. We talked about expanding our pipeline past couple of quarters, and we're starting to benefit from the efforts of this pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned, you will recall, our sweet spot is that 4[ph] -- $50 million to $200 million deal, but we've expanded our horizons now. We're looking for deals up to $500 million in revenue, and we're looking at both private and public companies, and we're really optimistic because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline. So in terms of acquisitions, it is a tougher environment. We're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline. We end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can have the most value to, and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement. So I'm really optimistic. We have plenty of firepower, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million. Free cash flow, about $670 million. And I think this can be a significant driver for the balance of 2016 and 2017 performance."

Really, if you look at, it can explained really easily economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas and metals. That results in a 50% decremental, the oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses, so you take that $50 million and you look at the numbers of shares we have, it turns out of $0.16, which fits right in the midpoint of the guidance range. So that's what happened economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our business, we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally, we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2, and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year. In terms of our oil and gas business, it drops lower than we initially anticipated and we had modest improvements on that business, and now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary you heard from Halliburton, Schlumberger where what bottoms in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed. To your point how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I talked a little bit about the first half being the second half being similar, and really, embedded within our guidance is really our Q4 is really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2. So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact, Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer and we have normal seasonality in Q4, but really, Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and how we're accurate, how we feels more confident, I mean many of you who follow AMETEK for quite a while. And in the past, our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results, and it happened the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have visibility from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets. Customers are delaying capital projects. Customers are managing inventory very aggressively. The emerging markets are challenged. But all that said, we need to do a better job of forecasting our environment. And I asked Bill and the group presidents to take a look at our forecasting products process with the focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting. We got an entire executive office involved. We took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecasts and to better assess potential risk. We had conversations with the financial communities, so we understood what's happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it's the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leader running our niche businesses who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view. We applied a consensus to the risk. It's reflected in our guidance. And the final point, this is a rigorous process and I feel confident in the results."

We have 5% of our sales in the U.K., We're balanced in revenues and expenses, so we have a natural hedge, so not going to have any translation action or translation surprise, so we expect the short-term impact to be minimal. We've been checking with our U.K. businesses on a weekly basis. We haven't seen any downturn in orders yet, mainly because we're in a market that's maybe be tied to the consumer there. And you're right, longer-term impact, driven with the an economic growth on the European and the global growth, and this uncertainty is going to go on for some time, but we are feeling pretty good about our exposure, and there are weak global macro conditions. I mean, we highlighted oil and gas and metals, but certainly, the global economy is not good, and yet, the spillover effect from oil and gas into the other markets. So all the markets are tough. Again, what the first half and the second half, they're essentially carbon copies of each other, and we are very comfortable with it."

This business, we take metals, metals such as titanium, vanadium, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and process them with very unique processing capabilities into specialty alloys, powders, components, and we're very -- we have strong niche positions, and we feel very good about this business. What's happening is 2 things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be 4 or 5 levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So as a result, the visibility is limited. And we can get misaligned with the broader end market demand given the inventory buildup in the channel. And we're seeing this play out right now. To give you a tangible example, we produced specialized master alloys, which is a critical component in the making of titanium part of a aircraft. We're one of the few producers who can make the specialized alloy, but we're far down removed on the food chain. So we sell to a titanium melter who sales to an good maker who sells to a part manufacturer who sales to SMB -- subassembly manufacture who adventure gets to the airplane. So we're quite far away removed from this business different than most of our businesses, and we really -- we identify some secondary inventory locations who had some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloys in this case in aircraft is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloy is being impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain."

And our capital deployments been excellent. We're using our free cash flow to acquire good businesses and make them better. But in my role, the only question, organic growth is important. And certainly, over the next few years when the environment can be slower, we can deal with flatter markets, I'm taking the current aftermarket headwinds aside with the oil and gas and metals, but separate from that, when we return to more flattish stabilized markets, we look at that our strategy to potential new reality of the marketplace. And really, when I look at it, to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next 5 years by low to mid single-digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job with the organic growth. And our organic growth, we've been average. We've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our Operational Excellence token, and put more tools in that tool kit to focus on our sales and marketing processes, really making the front end of our business as good as our operations, and that's going to be an area of focus for me and my.

And China was down mid-single digits, so there is a little bit of an improvement in China, better trend for Asia where we were down double digits for 3 quarters in a row, and now we're down mid-single digits and China was a negative 4%.

Good morning.AMETEK delivered second quarter results that were in line with our expectation, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses and managing in a challenging global environment.

AMETEK delivered second quarter results that were in line with our expectation, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses and managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired 2 businesses, Nu Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers, and HS Foils, a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I will talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.
Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%. Organic sales were down 7%, where acquisitions added 4%. The impact from currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from last year's second quarter. Free cash flow converged into net income was a strong 126%.
Now turning to the individual operating groups.
First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 6%. Acquisitions contributed 6%. And foreign currency was flat. The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continued to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from its February lows, customers remain cautious. They continue to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated.
EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $152.1 million, and operating margins were strong 25.5%.
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%. Acquisitions contributed 2%. And foreign currency was flat. EMG sales remain pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our specialty metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected.
EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter, and operating margins were a solid 21%.
Now let me provide background on the 2 acquisitions we announced this morning.
First, Nu Instruments. Nu Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometers used for elemental and isotopic analysis. Nu's mass spectrometers utilize the magnetic field to separate the isotopes of elements in order to analyze the material characterization of a sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within Earth and Environmental Sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. Nu is an excellent strategic fit with our CAMECA advanced elemental analysis business.
Nu's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offering will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets, while opening up opportunities to expand in new, attractive market segments. In addition, Nu will be able to leverage CAMECA's strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.
Nu Instruments is headquartered in Wrexham in the U.K. with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million.
The second acquisition is HS Foils. HS Foils develops and produces key components used in radiation detectors. Each component include ultrathin radiation windows, silicon drift detectors and x-ray filters. HS Foils is an technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology as well as extensive knowledge in silicon PIN and silicon drift detector manufacturing.
HS Foils' technology will enable world-class instrument performance across many of our materials analysis businesses, including AMETEK, EDAX, SPECTRO and CAMECA.
In addition, HS Foils operate out of the state-of-the-art semiconductor fab in Helsinki, Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives.
With these 2 acquisitions, we have now deployed approximately $360 million capital and acquired over $150 million in revenue on 4 acquisitions so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.
Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013.
Creaform, which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in standalone portable 3D scanners.
Creaform's optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within the Aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing.
Creaform has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition. Operating margins have more than doubled. Working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level over approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40% to now nearly 65%.
This new product capability has been an important driver of Creaform's success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products, which help them penetrate new markets and capture additional share in their existing markets.
Most recently, Creaform's new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious Red Dot Best of the Best award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 years, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world. So this is a great honor.
Specifically, Creaform's products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new Creaform products recognized are the HandyPROBE Next, the MetraSCAN 3D and C-Track.
Within Global & Market Expansion, the Creaform team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing the strong market presence and quality control in reverse engineering into new markets, such as nondestructive testing and healthcare. Creaform has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to the customer while also leveraging AMETEK's global footprint to expand the direct sales activities in the U.S., Brazil and Southeast Asia.
I would like to congratulate the Creaform team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business through the execution of our growth strategies.
Now let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on our outlook for 2016.
We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment, given our mix of end market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas and metals market, have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year.
Visibility have remain limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels in capital-spending plans.
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second-half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half.
As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits.
We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share.
In summary, we remain focused on executing our 4 growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We will continue to aggressively manage our business in the short term, while ensuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flows that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.
Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability. We have rightsized the cost structure, and we'll realize meaningful incremental margins as the current market headwinds subside.
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our earning's expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end market conditions. I'll provide some of the financial highlights.
In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27%, as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter, and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $40 million -- $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million.
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter. And as a percent of net income, free cash flow was 126% for the second quarter, and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income.
Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30th of 33.4%. At June 30th, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow, with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, HS Foils and Nu Instruments, springing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million. And as well on the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million.
In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We are well positioned to support our growth initiatives, with our strong balance sheet and cash flows.

Yes, the question of price across our whole business, we were up about 1 point, and we had total inflation of a little less than that. So we're still a positive contribution. We are seeing additional headwinds, as you talked about, so we call that flat for the year, meaning, price will offset inflation. So it's a different environment. In our Process businesses, they were very successful in expanding in the emerging markets, also very successful in the oil and gas market. So that is one point that we're seeing issues. Certainly, with a strong U.S. dollar when we're manufacturing in the U.S., we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low-cost locations. And in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that give us an advantage. But in terms of the translation and transaction affects, now we're in a relatively stable environment, we're not seeing much effect. And you know we are naturally hedged in most of our markets. So I hope those answers your questions."

EIG Aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw a continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by weakness in the business of regional jet market. For all of 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business in regional jets. This business continues to draw -- deliver strong new program wins. These wins are across wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business in regional jets, military. And year-to-date, they have already won $230 million in [indiscernible] program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market, and you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business. Next up segment will be Process. Organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by weakness across our oil and gas business. Our Ultra Precision Technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down mid to high-single digits, driven by the weakness in oil and gas. Going to the EIG Power & Industrial subsegment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits, driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back in 2016 for all of EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits. And if we switch to EMG, first, the differentiated parts of our EMG business. Organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by continued weakness across our Engineered Materials Interconnects and Packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second-half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016. As a result, we expect second-half sales across our EMG businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business, we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. And finally, our forecast in specialty motors business, although a small part of AMETEK, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were down low teens in the second quarter, as a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016, we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically, as comparisons ease to the back half of the year. So if you look at all EMG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits. And for AMETEK, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Hope that helps."

The second point is we're bullish on our pipeline. We talked about expanding our pipeline past couple of quarters. And we're starting to benefit from the efforts of this pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned, you will recall, our sweet spot is that 4 [ph] -- $50 million to $200 million deal, but we've expanded our horizons now. We're looking for deals up to $500 million in revenue, and we're looking at both private and public companies. And we're really optimistic because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters, as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline. So in terms of acquisitions, it is a tougher environment. We're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline. We end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can have the most value to, and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement. So I'm really optimistic. We have plenty of firepower, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million. Free cash flow about $670 million, and I think this can be a significant driver for the balance of 2016 and 2017 performance."

Really, if you look at, it can explained really easily, economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas and metals. That results in a 50% decremental. The oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses. So you take that $50 million and you look at the numbers of shares we have, it turns out to $0.16, which fits right in the midpoint of the guidance range. So that's what happened economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our EMG business, we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally, we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2, and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year. In terms of our oil and gas business, it drops lower than we initially anticipated. And we had modest improvements in that business. And now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed, based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary you heard from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, where rig counts bottomed in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed. To your point how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I talked a little bit about the first half being the second half being similar. And really, embedded within our guidance is really our Q4. It's really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2. So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact, Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer, and we have normal seasonality in Q4, but really, Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and how we're accurate, how we feel more confident, I mean, many of you have followed AMETEK for quite a while. And in the past, our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results, and it happened in the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have visibility away from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets. Customers are delaying capital projects. Customers are managing [ph] inventory aggressively. The emerging markets are challenged. But all that said, we have to do a better job forecasting on environment. And I asked Bill and the group presidents to take a look at our forecasting products, Process, with the focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting. We got an entire executive office involved. We took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecasts and to better assess potential risk. We had conversations with the financial communities, so we understood what was happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it's the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leader running our niche businesses, who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view. We applied a consensus view of risk. It's reflected on our guidance. And the final point, this is a rigorous process, and I feel confident in the results."

So we're not going to have any transaction or translation surprise. So we expect a short-term impact to be minimal. We've been checking with our U.K. businesses on a weekly basis. We haven't seen any downturn in orders yet, mainly because we're in a market that's not maybe tied to the consumer there. And you're right, longer-term impact, it will be driven with the economic growth on the European and the global growth, and this uncertainty is going to go on for some time, but we are feeling pretty good about our exposure. And there are weak global macro conditions. I mean, we highlighted oil and gas and metals, but certainly, the global economy is not good, and yet, the spillover effect from oil and gas into the other markets. So all the markets are tough.

What's happening is 2 things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be 4 or 5 levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So as a result, the visibility is limited. And we can get misaligned with a broader end market demand, given the inventory buildup in the channel. And we're seeing this play out right now. To give you a tangible example, we produced specialized master alloys, which is a critical component in the making of titanium parts of a aircraft. We're one of the few producers who can make the specialized alloy, but we're far down removed on the food chain. So we sell to a titanium melter, who sells to an ingot maker, who sells to a part manufacturer, who sells to subassembly manufacturer, who eventually gets on the airframe. So we're quite a way removed in this business different than most of our businesses. And we really -- we identify some secondary inventory locations who has some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloy, in this case, in aircraft is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloy is being impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain."

And really, when I look at it, to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next 5 years by low to mid-single-digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job with organic growth. And our organic growth, we've been average. We've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our Operational Excellence toolkit, and put more tools in that tool kit to focus on our sales and marketing processes, really making the front end of our business as good as our operations.

Also, subsequent to the end of the second qua",1499,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning.
AMETEK delivered second quarter results that were in line with our expectation, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses in managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired 2 businesses, Nu Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers, and HS Foils, a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I will talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.
Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%. Organic sales were down 7%, while acquisitions added 4%. The impact from currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from last year's second quarter. Free cash flow converged into net income was a strong 126%.
Now turning to the individual operating groups.
First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 6%. Acquisitions contributed 6%. And foreign currency was flat. The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continued to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from its February lows, customers remain cautious. They continue to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated.
EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $152.1 million, and operating margins were a strong 25.5%.
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%. Acquisitions contributed 2%. And foreign currency was flat. EMG sales remain pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our specialty metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected.
EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter, and operating margins were a solid 21%.
Now let me provide background on the 2 acquisitions we announced this morning.
First, Nu Instruments. Nu Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometers used for elemental and isotopic analysis. Nu's mass spectrometers utilize the magnetic field to separate the isotopes of elements in order to analyze the material characterization of a sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within Earth and Environmental Sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. Nu is an excellent strategic fit with our CAMECA advanced elemental analysis business.
Nu's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offering will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets, while opening up opportunities to expand in new, attractive market segments. In addition, Nu will be able to leverage CAMECA's strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.
Nu Instruments is headquartered in Wrexham in the U.K. with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million.
The second acquisition is HS Foils. HS Foils develops and produces the key components used in radiation detectors. Each component includes ultrathin radiation windows, Silicon Drift Detectors and x-ray fillers. HS Foils is an excellent technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology as well as extensive knowledge in silicon PIN and Silicon Drift Detector manufacturing.
HS Foils' technology will enable world-class instrument performance across many of our materials analysis businesses, including AMETEK, EDAX, SPECTRO and CAMECA. In addition, HS Foils operates out of a state-of-the-art semiconductor fab in Helsinki, Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives.
With these 2 acquisitions, we have now deployed approximately $360 million capital and acquired over $115 million in revenue on 4 acquisitions so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.
Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013.
Creaform, which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in standalone portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within the Aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing.
Creaform has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition. Operating margins have more than doubled. Working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level over approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40% to now nearly 65%.
This new product capability has been an important driver of Creaform's success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products, which help them penetrate new markets and capture additional share in their existing markets.
Most recently, Creaform's new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious Red Dot Best of the Best award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 years, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world. So this is a great honor.
Specifically, Creaform's products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new Creaform products recognized are the HandyPROBE Next, the MetraSCAN 3D and the C-Track.
Within Global & Market Expansion, the Creaform team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing the strong market presence and quality control in reverse engineering into new markets, such as nondestructive testing and healthcare. Creaform has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to their customers while also leveraging AMETEK's global footprint to expand the direct sales activities in the U.S., Brazil and Southeast Asia. I would like to congratulate the Creaform team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business through the execution of our growth strategies.
Now let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on our outlook for 2016. We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment, given our mix of end market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas and metals market, have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year.
Visibility has remain limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels in capital-spending plans.
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second-half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half. As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits.
We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share. Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share.
In summary, we remain focused on executing our 4 growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We will continue to aggressively manage our business in the short term, while ensuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flows that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability. We have rightsized the cost structure, and we'll realize meaningful incremental margins as the current market headwinds subside.
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our earning's expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end market conditions. I will provide some of the financial highlights.
In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27%, as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter, and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $40 million -- $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million.
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter. And as a percent of net income, free cash flow was 126% for the second quarter, and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income.
Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 33.4%. At June 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow, with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, HS Foils and Nu Instruments, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million. And as well on the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million.
In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We are well positioned to support our growth initiatives, with our strong balance sheet and cash flows.

So the difference really is it's a much slower market and the market has drug on for some time, and we have much higher margin company right now. If you remember that we were a mid-teens operating income margin company. Now we're much higher. And the 2 markets that are down about 20% of our company, oil and gas and metals, are down 30%. So that's a difficult headwind to offset, but we've done a good job to do it. We still have 22.4% operating margins, and we had a good operating quarter."

In our Process businesses, they were very successful in expanding in the emerging markets, also very successful in the oil and gas market. So that is one point that we're seeing issues. Certainly, with a strong U.S. dollar when we're manufacturing in the U.S., we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low-cost locations. And in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that gives us an advantage. But in terms of the translation and transaction effects, now we're in a relatively stable environment, we're not seeing much effect. And you know we are naturally hedged in most of our markets.

EIG Aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw a continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by weakness in the business of regional jet market. For all of 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business in regional jets. This business continues to draw -- deliver strong new program wins. These wins are across a wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business in regional jets, military. And year-to-date, they have already won $230 million in life of program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market, and you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business. Next up segment will be Process. Organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by weakness across our oil and gas business. Our Ultra Precision Technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down mid to high-single digits, driven by the weakness in oil and gas. Going to the EIG Power & Industrial subsegment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits, driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back in 2016 for all of EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits. And if we switch to EMG, first, the differentiated parts of our EMG business. Organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by continued weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second-half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016. As a result, we expect second-half sales across our EMIP businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business, we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. And finally, our forecast in specialty motors business, although a small part of AMETEK, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were down low teens in the second quarter, as a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016, we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically, as comparisons ease to the back half of the year. So if you look at all EMG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits. And including all of AMETEK, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Hope that helps."

And we're starting to benefit from the efforts of this pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned, you will recall, our sweet spot is that 4 [ph] -- $50 million to $200 million deal, but we've expanded our horizons now.

And we're really optimistic because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters, as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline. So in terms of acquisitions, it is a tougher environment. We're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline. We end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can add the most value to, and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement. So I'm really optimistic. We have plenty of firepower, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million.

Unfortunately, it comes under not terrific auspices, but I certainly did like the answer to -- or how you finished Rob's question just now. I guess maybe more surgically, I was wondering if you could tell us what were the pressure points on the second half effective guidance reduction here? What changed? You seemed to have pretty good line of sight. You gave us some really good numbers in the first quarter as to why the guidance needs to come down. Could you maybe do something similar to that for the second half to perhaps make us feel as good as you feel about the full year guidance at this point?"

One, really, what's driving the take down, and why do we feel good about the stabilization? So I'll take the first point. Really, if you look at this, it can be explained really easily, economically. Our organic grow",635,"Yes. There's kind of 2 parts in there. One, really, what's driving the take down, and why do we feel good about the stabilization? So I'll take the first point. Really, if you look at this, it can be explained really easily, economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas and metals. That results in a 50% decremental. Oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses. So you take that $50 million and you look at the number of shares we have, it turns out to $0.16, which fits right in the midpoint of the guidance range. So that's what happened economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our EMIP business, we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally, we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2, and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year. In terms of our oil and gas business, it drops lower than we initially anticipated. And we had modest improvements in that business. And now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed, based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary you’ve heard from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, where rig counts bottomed in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed. To your point how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I talked a little bit about the first half being the second half being similar. And really, embedded within our guidance is really our Q4. It's really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2. So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact, Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer, and we have normal seasonality in Q4, but really, Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and how we're accurate, how we feel more confident, I mean, many of you have followed AMETEK for quite a while. And in the past, our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results, and it hasn’t in the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have -- visibility is weak from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets. Customers are delaying capital projects. Customers are managing inventory aggressively. The emerging markets are challenged. But all that said, we have to do a better job forecasting that environment. And I asked Bill and the group presidents to take a look at our forecasting products -- process, with the focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting. We got our entire executive office involved. We took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecasts and to better assess potential risk. We had conversations with the financial communities, so we understood what was happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it's the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leader running our niche businesses, who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view. We applied a consensus view of risk. It's reflected in our guidance. And the final point, this is a rigorous process, and I feel confident in the results."

So we're not going to have any transaction or translation surprise. So we expect the short-term impact to be minimal. We've been checking with our U.K. businesses on a weekly basis. We haven't seen any downturn in orders yet, mainly because we're in a market that's not maybe tied to the consumer there. And you're right, longer-term impact, it will be driven with the economic growth, on the European and the global growth, and this uncertainty is going to go on for some time, but we are feeling pretty good about our exposure. And there are weak global macro conditions. I mean, we highlighted oil and gas and metals, but certainly, the global economy is not good, and yet, the spillover effect from oil and gas into other markets. So all the markets are tough.

In this business, we take metals, metals such as titanium, vanadium, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and process them with very unique processing capabilities into specialty alloys, powders, components, and we're very -- we have strong niche positions, and we feel very good about this business. What's happening is 2 things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be 4 or 5 levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So as a result, the visibility is limited. And we can get misaligned with a broader end market demand, given the inventory buildup in the channel. And we're seeing this play out right now. To give you a tangible example, we produce specialized master alloys, which is a critical component in the making of titanium parts for aircraft. We're one of the few producers who can make this specialized alloy, but we're far down removed on the food chain. So we sell to a titanium melter, who sells to an ingot maker, who sells to a part manufacturer, who sells to a subassembly manufacturer, who eventually gets on the airframe. So we're quite a way removed in this business, different than most of our businesses. And we really -- we identified some secondary inventory locations who had some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloy, in this case, in aircraft is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloy is being impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain."

And I get a lot of assessment of AMETEK's performance, obviously, before I got into the role and in the role. And I'm a bit biased and look at our earnings growth through the cycle in the last 10 years, we grew 160% compounded annually. And I give myself a good grade for that, an A. Margins, same kind of thing. Highest margins in the industrial space. The cash flow generation has been outstanding. Our return on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital. And our capital deployment has been excellent. We're using our free cash flow to acquire good businesses and make them better. But in my role -- dealing with your question, organic growth is important. And certainly, over the next few years when the environment can be slower, we can deal with flatter markets, I'm taking the current aftermarket headwinds aside with oil and gas and metals, but separate from that, when we return to more flattish, stabilized markets, we need to adapt our strategy to the potential new reality in the marketplace. And really, when I look at it, to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next 5 years by low to mid-single-digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job with organic growth. And our organic growth, we've been average. We've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our Operational Excellence toolkit, and put more tools in that tool kit to focus on our sales and marketing processes, really making the front end of our business as good as our operations. And that's going to be an area of focus for me and my team, and it's going to take some time. It's not going to be something that moves the needle in the short term, but I'm confident it can get better. So we're focused on making organic growth better to your exact question. I think in a slow environment, we're going to have to boost it a little bit to get that low to mid-single-digit organic growth that allow us to double the earnings of the company."

And in Asia, we were down mid-single digits. And China was down mid-single digits, so there is a little bit of an improvement in China. There was a better trend for Asia where we were down double digits for 3 quarters in a row, and now we're down mid-single digits, and China was a negative 4%. So orders for the region, the entire Asia region were a little bit better than prior year, so it seems to be that Asia is stabilizing, China is stabilizing.

AMETEK delivered second quarter results that were in line with our expectation, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses in managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired 2 businesses, Nu Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers, and HS Foils, a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I will talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.
Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%. Organic sales were down 7%, while acquisitions added 4%. The impact from currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from last year's second quarter. Free cash flow converged into net income was a strong 126%.
Now turning to the individual operating groups.
First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 6%. Acquisitions contributed 6%. And foreign currency was flat. The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continued to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from its February lows, customers remain cautious. They continue to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated.
EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $152.1 million, and operating margins were a strong 25.5%.
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%. Acquisitions contributed 2%. And foreign currency was flat. EMG sales remain pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our specialty metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected.
EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter, and operating margins were a solid 21%.
Now let me provide background on the 2 acquisitions we announced this morning.
First, Nu Instruments. Nu Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometers used for elemental and isotopic analysis. Nu's mass spectrometers utilize the magnetic field to separate the isotopes of elements in order to analyze the material characterization of a sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within Earth and Environmental Sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. Nu is an excellent strategic fit with our CAMECA advanced elemental analysis business.
Nu's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offering will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets, while opening up opportunities to expand in new, attractive market segments. In addition, Nu will be able to leverage CAMECA's strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.
Nu Instruments is headquartered in Wrexham in the U.K. with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million.
The second acquisition is HS Foils. HS Foils develops and produces the key components used in radiation detectors. Each component includes ultrathin radiation windows, Silicon Drift Detectors and x-ray fillers. HS Foils is an excellent technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology as well as extensive knowledge in silicon PIN and Silicon Drift Detector manufacturing.
HS Foils' technology will enable world-class instrument performance across many of our materials analysis businesses, including AMETEK, EDAX, SPECTRO and CAMECA. In addition, HS Foils operates out of a state-of-the-art semiconductor fab in Helsinki, Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives.
With these 2 acquisitions, we have now deployed approximately $360 million capital and acquired over $115 million in revenue on 4 acquisitions so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.
Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013.
Creaform, which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in standalone portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within the Aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing.
Creaform has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition. Operating margins have more than doubled. Working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level over approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40% to now nearly 65%.
This new product capability has been an important driver of Creaform's success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products, which help them penetrate new markets and capture additional share in their existing markets.
Most recently, Creaform's new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious Red Dot Best of the Best award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 years, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world. So this is a great honor.
Specifically, Creaform's products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new Creaform products recognized are the HandyPROBE Next, the MetraSCAN 3D and the C-Track.
Within Global & Market Expansion, the Creaform team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing the strong market presence and quality control in reverse engineering into new markets, such as nondestructive testing and healthcare. Creaform has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to their customers while also leveraging AMETEK's global footprint to expand the direct sales activities in the U.S., Brazil and Southeast Asia. I would like to congratulate the Creaform team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business through the execution of our growth strategies.
Now let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on our outlook for 2016. We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment, given our mix of end market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas and metals market, have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year.
Visibility has remain limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels in capital-spending plans.
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second-half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half. As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits.
We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share. Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share.
In summary, we remain focused on executing our 4 growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We will continue to aggressively manage our business in the short term, while ensuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flows that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability.

As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our earning's expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end market conditions. I will provide some of the financial highlights.
In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27%, as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter, and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $40 million -- $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million.
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter. And as a percent of net income, free cash flow was 126% for the second quarter, and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income.
Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 33.4%. At June 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow, with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, HS Foils and Nu Instruments, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million. And as well on the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million.
In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We are well positioned to support our growth initiatives, with our strong balance sheet and cash flows.

Certainly, with a strong U.S. dollar when we're manufacturing in the U.S., we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low-cost locations. And in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that gives us an advantage.

EIG Aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw a continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by weakness in the business of regional jet market. For all of 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business in regional jets. This business continues to draw -- deliver strong new program wins. These wins are across a wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business in regional jets, military. And year-to-date, they have already won $230 million in life of program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market, and you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business. Next up segment will be Process. Organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by weakness across our oil and gas business. Our Ultra Precision Technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down mid to high-single digits, driven by the weakness in oil and gas. Going to the EIG Power & Industrial subsegment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits, driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back in 2016 for all of EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits. And if we switch to EMG, first, the differentiated parts of our EMG business. Organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by continued weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second-half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016. As a result, we expect second-half sales across our EMIP businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business, we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. And finally, our forecast in specialty motors business, although a small part of AMETEK, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were down low teens in the second quarter, as a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016, we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically, as comparisons ease to the back half of the year. So if you look at all EMG, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits. And including all of AMETEK, we expect overall sales to be down low single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Hope that helps."

And we're about halfway through the year, so we're pretty much on line for what we're doing. So we agreed that the environment is tough, but we're still getting it done. The second point is we're bullish on our pipeline. We talked about expanding our pipeline past couple of quarters. And we're starting to benefit from the efforts of this pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned, you will recall, our sweet spot is that 4 [ph] -- $50 million to $200 million deal, but we've expanded our horizons now. We're looking for deals up to $500 million in revenue, and we're looking at both private and public companies. And we're really optimistic because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters, as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline. So in terms of acquisitions, it is a tougher environment. We're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline. We end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can add the most value to, and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement. So I'm really optimistic. We have plenty of firepower, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million. Free cash flow about $670 million, and I think this can be a significant driver for the balance of 2016 and 2017 performance."

Really, if you look at this, it can be explained really easily, economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas and metals. That results in a 50% decremental. Oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses. So you take that $50 million and you look at the number of shares we have, it turns out to $0.16, which fits right in the midpoint of the guidance range. So that's what happened economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our EMIP business, we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally, we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2, and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year. In terms of our oil and gas business, it drops lower than we initially anticipated. And we had modest improvements in that business. And now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed, based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary you’ve heard from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, where rig counts bottomed in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed. To your point how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I talked a little bit about the first half being the second half being similar. And really, embedded within our guidance is really our Q4. It's really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2. So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact, Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer, and we have normal seasonality in Q4, but really, Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and how we're accurate, how we feel more confident, I mean, many of you have followed AMETEK for quite a while. And in the past, our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results, and it hasn’t in the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have -- visibility is weak from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets. Customers are delaying capital projects. Customers are managing inventory aggressively. The emerging markets are challenged. But all that said, we have to do a better job forecasting that environment. And I asked Bill and the group presidents to take a look at our forecasting products -- process, with the focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting. We got our entire executive office involved. We took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecasts and to better assess potential risk. We had conversations with the financial communities, so we understood what was happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it's the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leader running our niche businesses, who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view. We applied a consensus view of risk. It's reflected in our guidance. And the final point, this is a rigorous process, and I feel confident in the results."

What's happening is 2 things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be 4 or 5 levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So as a result, the visibility is limited. And we can get misaligned with a broader end market demand, given the inventory buildup in the channel. And we're seeing this play out right now. To give you a tangible example, we produce specialized master alloys, which is a critical component in the making of titanium parts for aircraft. We're one of the few producers who can make this specialized alloy, but we're far down removed on the food chain. So we sell to a titanium melter, who sells to an ingot maker, who sells to a part manufacturer, who sells to a subassembly manufacturer, who eventually gets on the airframe. So we're quite a way removed in this business, different than most of our businesses. And we really -- we identified some secondary inventory locations who had some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloy, in this case, in aircraft is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloy is being impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain."

And the interesting thing about it -- in the news, there's a lot of questions about food contamination. And the interesting thing about the Nu equipment is it's just so sensitive and has a unique processing capability. It can actually tell if there's a contamination, and it's sensitive enough to tell where in the world the food is from. So we're very optimistic for the food testing market.

And our capital deployment has been excellent. We're using our free cash flow to acquire good businesses and make them better. But in my role -- dealing with your question, organic growth is important. And certainly, over the next few years when the environment can be slower, we can deal with flatter markets, I'm taking the current aftermarket headwinds aside with oil and gas and metals, but separate from that, when we return to more flattish, stabilized markets, we need to adapt our strategy to the potential new reality in the marketplace. And really, when I look at it, to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next 5 years by low to mid-single-digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job with organic growth. And our organic growth, we've been average. We've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our Operational Excellence toolkit, and put more tools in that tool kit to focus on our sales and marketing processes, really making the front end of our business as good as our operations. And that's going to be an area of focus for me and my team, and it's going to take some time. It's not going to be something that moves the needle in the short term, but I'm confident it can get better. So we're focused on making organic growth better to your exact question.

So geographic-wise, it's squared with our concept of stabilization. I mean, fundamentally, our business has stabilized, and we are working on earnings growth for 2017 now. We are focused on our business. We are getting ready to go into our budgeting process. And that budgeting process that we go through in Q3 and spreads into Q4, there's really no area immune from efficiency improvement. We're going to look at things like global sourcing, low-cost region production, value analysis, value engineering, plant consolidations, India engineering, all the tools that we have, and we're going to get a healthy cost-reduction target. And we're going to pair that with acquisitions, and that's how we're going to grow earnings next year.

We feel business conditions across our most challenging markets are beginning to stabilize. Although we remain cautious about the short-term demand environment, we are encouraged with the stabilization. 
Also, I am pleased to announce that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Laserage Technology, a provider of laser-based fabrication services for the medical device industry and an excellent fit with our engineered medical components business. 
With this acquisition, we have now acquired 5 businesses so far in 2016 and have deployed approximately $390 million in capital. We also deployed approximately $100 million on share repurchases during the third quarter. 
To support our capital deployment activities, we announced today that we entered into a private placement agreement to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes at attractive rates. We'll provide more detail on the recent acquisition and our private placement later. But at these activity shows, AMETEK remains committed to the discipline deployment of capital. 
Now let me provide a financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations in the third quarter at $945 million, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 8% while acquisitions added 3%. The impact from foreign currency in the quarter was negligible. 
Operating income in the quarter was $201.1 million and operating income margin was 21.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, down 14% over last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. First, Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $579.3 million were down 3% versus last year's third quarter. Organic sales were down 8% [ph], acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was flat. 
The strong acquisition growth was driven by the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, NU Instruments and HS Foils. The organic sales decline was driven in part by weakness across our oil and gas markets. Results for our oil and gas businesses were as expected, with conditions beginning to stabilize across each of our upstream, midstream and downstream businesses. 
EIG's operating income in the third quarter was $142.7 million, and operating income margins were 24.6%. 
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $365.7 million, down 9% versus the third quarter of last year with organic sales down 7% and foreign currency at 1% headwind. The largest driver of the sales swing was our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. This business has also began to stabilize and expect to see similar conditions in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. 
EMG's operating income was $71.4 million in the quarter and operating margins were 19.5%. 
Now let me provide some background on the acquisition we announced this morning. Laserage is a leading provider of laser fabrication services to the medical device market. They offer precision to fabrication of minimally-invasive surgical devices, stents, specialty catheters and catheter-based delivery systems. They also have excellent design capabilities for medical devices. 
Laserage is an excellent addition to our growing presence in the medical industry. It is a great strategic fit with our engineered medical components business as it provides excellent market and technology synergies. 
In addition, the business operates in markets and applications with strong growth characteristics. Laserage were privately held. It's headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois, with a manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. 
Laserage annual sales of $22 million. I would like to welcome the team from Laserage to AMETEK. 
We remain very active in identifying and executing highly strategic acquisitions across our businesses. The pipeline of acquisitions remains very solid and our teams continue to do an outstanding job supporting our M&A efforts. 
In addition to our continued focus on investing in strategic acquisitions, we continue to make investments to support long-term organic growth. 
In particular, we continue to make sizable investments in research, development and engineering and in 2016, we expect to invest $205 million or 5% of scales. I want to highlight just a few our recent new product introductions. 
Our Filetron Analytical business, a global leader in electric chemical and [indiscernible] spectroscopy for materials and mechanical research has added 4 new application-specific instruments to their abs XM series of laboratory instruments. The XM stands for extreme measurement and each new specific was developed with specific capabilities for highly targeted research applications. Each occupies less than half of footprint of similar laboratory instruments and provides increased measurement performance. These instruments are used for testing energy storage devices such as batteries, super capacitors and fuel cells as well as for testing materials used in solar and solar cell applications. 
AMETEK's Aerospace & Defense developed a patent pending exhaust gas thermocouple with a sheet made from an advanced ceramic matrix composite. The thermocouple is used to measure temperature and jet engine exhaust gases, and its highly advanced ceramic mode of heating extends the thermocouple's high temperature performance range. The heating material is 1/3 a stent of steel and nickel alloys exhibit better performance than pure ceramic materials and extends the life of the thermocouple having to postpone costly jet engine overhauls. 
Our Vision Research business, which is the leader in high-speed imaging systems, unveiled its new family of phantom VIO high-speed cameras. These compact rugged cameras are designed for a wide range of applications, including scientific analysis, material testing and defense research. The VIO family includes 8 individual models across 4 performance levels and 2 body styles providing users the flexibility for their specific needs. These high-speed, high-resolution cameras are packed full of features in a 5-inch cube that is designed for durability and can stand up to 100G performance. 
These investments in research and development combined with our strong engineering talent across the company are driving excellent new product development results. 
Revenue from new products introduced over the last 3 years, our vitality index was an excellent 25% in the quarter. 
We also remain focused on driving our Operational Excellence strategy. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging our operational excellence performance token. 
Overall in 2016, we expect to generate $130 million in total Operational Excellence savings. These operational excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing and strategic procurement, value analysis and value engineering, design for Six Sigma and the movement of production to low cost, low [indiscernible]. These op ex initiatives also includes various tools that are focused on the front-end of our business. As I noted last quarter, we are focused on leveraging and broadening tools in this area across all of our businesses to ensure we are profitably positioned for long-term growth. 
Now I'll return for the outlook for the balance of the year. Our expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect 2016 revenue to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single-digit. We have tightened our guidance range for 2016 to a range of approximately $2.29 to $2.31 per diluted share even the midpoint of the guidance unchanged at $2.30. 
Fourth quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2015, with earnings of approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
In summary, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our full year sales guidance and the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We have acquired 5 high-quality businesses in 2016 and our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is excellent. We generate strong free cash flow and has the balance sheet flexibility to continue to acquire businesses. We remain focused on aggressively managing our businesses in the short term while ensuring we make appropriate investments to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. We have a deep and talented management team that will continue to execute our 4 growth strategies. 
I'm very bullish on the future of AMETEK and believe we all are well positioned to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. 
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details and provide more information on our private displacement. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our business has performed well in the third quarter, with solid results that met our expectations. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were down roughly in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's third quarter on higher consultant costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from last year's rate of 26.1%. We continue to expect our tax rate for 2016 to be between 26% and 27%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. 
Working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $42 million, and for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $165 million. 
Operating cash flow was $169 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $154 million, representing 118% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be a strong 125% of net income. 
We've been very active deploying our free cash flow this year. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $65 million on the acquisition of the NU Instruments and HS Foils and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $32 million on the acquisition of Laserage. 
These acquisitions form our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $390 million. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for approximately $100 million. 
The highest priority for our cash flow remains acquisitions. However, as we have shown, we will look to opportunistically deploy our cash flow and share buybacks. 
Total debt at September 30 was $2.15 billion, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. 
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $445 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 34%. 
At September 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
As we announced this morning, we entered into a private placement on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes. We are issuing EUR 500 million and GBP 225 million, all with maturities ranging from 10 to 15 years. The proceeds of this offering will be used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay a GBP 40 million note due later this month. 
The private placement was well received by our lenders. Overall, decision had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and a weighted average maturity of 11.5 years. This offering provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our business is managed very well in the third quarter in the face of challenging market conditions. We remain active in deploying capital and are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?"

We continue to see strong growth on our converged well OEM business. We won excellent content across a wide number of next-generation commercial aircraft platforms and we're really well positioned to benefit from the discontinued growth. Our business in regional jet business continues to be weak and the military was down a bit in a quarter due to program timing. So for all of 2016, we expect aerospace sales to be down low single digits, saw the growth in our commercial OEM business offset largely by weakness in the business of regional jet. I'm jumping into the process segment, organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and driven by weakness across our oil and gas businesses. We did see stabilization with our oil and gas businesses during the quarter as we expected, and we expect stabilization to continue through the fourth quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technologies, our UPT, business, again, had a very strong quarter, with good growth across our businesses and as a result of the new product rollouts and global and new market financial initiatives, it was a very positive quarter. For all of 2016, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be down mid-to high single digits, driven largely by oil and gas. Our sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by the contributions from acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down low double digits in the quarter, driven by a difficult prior year comparison. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for power industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. Organic sales who differentiated EMG businesses were down and single digits, driven largely by weakness across our engineered material interconnects and packaging business. We are starting to see stabilization in this business also as expected like oil and gas. For all our differentiated EMG, we continue to expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. For care and specialty motors, the last segment, smallest segments, organic sales were down high single digits in the third quarter, driven by softer demand across key markets and for all of 2016, we expect sales for this business to be down mid-single digits organically, unchanged from the previous expectations. When you look at it from the group level, for all of our EIG is unchanged from prior guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect overall sales to be down both single digits with both organic sales down mid-single digits due to the same for EMG, it's the same as prior guidance we provided last quarter, with both overall and organic sales down mid-single digits.

Yes, I'll start with -- entering the year, the oil and gas prices for AMETEK was about $360 million, and that was -- that's across our entire business. The majority of that is in electronic instruments, so our process segment. As they are played out, that business is going to be down about 33% or down about $120 million. That's 60% decline in our upstream business and 60% decline in our mid and downstream businesses. So if you go back at the peak, your upstream sales are down about 70% tied to the rig count decline in our midstream and downstream businesses are down about 20%, driven by cost of capital spending and delayed maintenance work. So we saw that the peak in 2014, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. We got into 2015, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. In 2016, we saw a continuing decline in the upstream, and then falling through the midstream. We went down up about 1/3 again about $240 million coming out of 2016. When we look at it, what I feel good about it when I look at the order rates. I mean, the order rates for our businesses are supporting a flat Q4 largely in the -- I'd say, kind of longer backlog business with some short term MRO business, but I feel good about the backlog we have entering the quarter. When I think about the beginning of the year, we were down large percentages in oil and gas, 35% in Q1, about the same in Q2. In Q3, we're down about 20%, and we think that will continue to wear down even less in Q4. So the sequential run rate in the business definitely have stabilized, our order rates stabilized and I think we took a good look at it at the end of Q2, and it feels the same right now."

So again, we're going to get detailed insight from our businesses, but one thing that we're sure of is that any small increase on organic growth, we've leaned the cost structure these businesses out.

I'll start with the U.S. We were down low double digits versus the prior year, and it was driven by broad industrial weakness, but the key factor that's driving negative growth were oil and gas and metals. And if you look at our trend, it's really been that way for the last 3 quarters. We've had about low double-digit, 10% decline the last 3 quarters, so it's stabilized at that level. If we jump over to Europe, it was down low single digits in line with recent trends there. We've been down low single digits for the better part of the year. Asia was the one positive. It was up 1% organically. That was -- if you think back over the past year, 1, 1.5 years, it was down low double digits, and down low double digits, down 10% down mid-single digits, so [indiscernible] quarters, now it's up 1%. And China, the biggest driver in Asia, was down slightly, so down about 1%. So we feel pretty good about Asia. We had good performance in Japan, in Korea and some other markets, so it was up 1% organically. When you go to the BRIC countries, overall, the BRIC countries are 11% of sales. We've been very successful historically in the BRIC countries, but the emerging markets are challenged right now. Our emerging market exposure is dominated by China, it's the largest, by far. And as I already mentioned, we were down about 1%. But when you look at places like Brazil and Russia, they were down very significant double digits, 20%-plus in each of those markets. And India has been a different story, it's been growing at mid single-digit rate. This quarter, it was a little different, it was down a bit, about 20%, but that's more from large program orders. We don't really have a base business in India yet. It will bounce around, but I really see that trend continuing. So basically in BRIC countries, we have China stabilized, that's the biggest market. India on a slow growth path and Brazil and Russia in the dumps."

Because of our strong niche market positions, I definitely feel that we have pricing power in our business. What you saw this year is a lot of migration to lower capability products within our portfolio. So instead of buying the high-end product that can do just about everything with all the bell and whistles, the customers migrated to more basic functionality. And that's really happened in the last downturn back in 2009 also. So we expect this, along with that price effect, we have -- which has been very difficult in the markets that are under duress that we talked a lot about like oil and gas and metals, you'll also have a mix effect that where people are buying down the product line. So those will be the 2 big factors that I will see. And I think as the market stabilizes, we'll see slow migration back up to the high end of the portfolio and we expect to get positive price. Our pricing was greater than total inflation in the business by a bit in the quarter, so we've been able to offset our total inflation, and it's not a good pricing environment. If I look back a couple of years, we were getting 2 points a price, so it's definitely down about where pricing in excess of inflation and I think that will improve as the general economic global level, macroeconomic trends improved."

We don't have a big exposure to consumer market. We have a limited exposure to the auto market. All these markets are cyclical as well, but they're doing well right now and will cycle down at some point in the future.

As I mentioned before, our strategy is to plan a broad set of diverse niche markets and we love to grow and expand these niches. And really the diversification is a key point. We don't want to get overexposed in any one single market. And even though we've had tremendous headwinds in oil and gas metals market, we're still very profitable company. Some of the best margins in the industrial space. So that the diversity is serving as well there. When you think about the parts of our portfolio that were doing well I mentioned our UPT business, I mentioned the medical space, I mentioned commercial OEM aerospace, those are in the acquisition queue with all of the other business. So we like to acquire more businesses in those areas for sure. When you answer the first part of your question saying, in actually pleased with the performance of our businesses and the cyclical markets, the oil and gas and metals business, we've leaned out the cost structures, those are excellent businesses with excellent niche positions, and I'm not sure of how the organic growth is gone to play out, but I can tell you, when it comes back, we're going to make a lot of money because those cost structures are leaned out. Regarding the organic growth of the company, I mentioned last quarter that we want to focus on the organic growth and making sure we're getting our fair share of the business and really focus in the front-end of the business and get as good in our sales and marketing functions as we earn our operational functions. So we need our customer facing capabilities to equal our strong operational capabilities, and we're working on that by looking at best practices and tools around our company and doing the same thing we did in the operations of applying them through our entire business. So we're focusing on key initiatives in that area, and that's largely driven from the fact that the next 5 years we might not be able to -- if you think back from 2005 to 2015, AMETEK grew 3% compounded annual growth rate and organic growth. We grew 8% in M&A, so 11% top line, and we've got 16% compound annual growth and EPS to the bottom line. If you want to continue that over the next few years, the next 5 years, which we clearly do, we're just going to take some average to work on organic growth across the company to make sure that we can outperform in that area. We're not talking about a meaningful change, not a needle mover long term. Certainly, not a benefit in 2017. But in 2018, I hope we'll see some benefits of some slightly better organic growth."

We feel business conditions across our most challenging markets are beginning to stabilize. Although we remain cautious about the short-term demand environment, we are encouraged with this stabilization. 
Also, I am pleased to announce that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Laserage Technology, a provider of laser-based fabrication services for the medical device industry, and an excellent fit with our engineered medical components business. 
With this acquisition, we have now acquired 5 businesses so far in 2016 and have deployed approximately $390 million in capital. We also deployed approximately $100 million on share repurchases during our third quarter. 
To support our capital deployment activities, we announced today that we entered into a private placement agreement to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes at attractive rates. We'll provide more detail on the recent acquisition and our private placement later. But as these activities show, AMETEK remains committed to the disciplined deployment of capital. 
Now let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations in the third quarter at $945 million, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 8% while acquisitions added 3%. The impact from foreign currency in the quarter was negligible. 
Operating income in the quarter was $201.1 million and operating income margin was 21.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, down 14% over last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. First, Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $579.3 million were down 3% versus last year's third quarter. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was flat. 
The strong acquisition growth was driven by the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments and HS Foils. The organic sales decline was driven in part by weakness across our oil and gas markets. Results for our oil and gas businesses were as expected, with conditions beginning to stabilize across each of our upstream, midstream and downstream businesses. 
EIG's operating income in the third quarter was $142.7 million, and operating income margins were 24.6%. 
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $365.7 million, down 9% versus the third quarter of last year, with organic sales down 7%, and foreign currency at 1% headwind. The largest driver of the sales weakness was our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. This business has also began to stabilize, and we expect to see similar conditions in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. 
EMG's operating income was $71.4 million in the quarter and operating margins were 19.5%. 
Now let me provide some background on the acquisition we announced this morning. Laserage is a leading provider of laser fabrication services to the medical device market. They offer precision tube fabrication of minimally-invasive surgical devices, stents, specialty catheters and catheter-based delivery systems. They also have excellent design capabilities for medical devices. 
Laserage is an excellent addition to our growing presence in the medical industry. It is a great strategic fit with our engineered medical components business as it provides excellent market and technology synergies. 
In addition, the business operates in markets and applications with strong growth characteristics. Laserage was privately held. It was headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois, with the manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. 
Laserage has annual sales of $22 million. I would like to welcome the team from Laserage to AMETEK. 
We remain very active in identifying and executing highly strategic acquisitions across our businesses. The pipeline of acquisitions remains very solid, and our teams continued to do an outstanding job supporting our M&A efforts. 
In addition to our continued focus on investing in strategic acquisitions, we continue to make investments to support long-term organic growth. 
In particular, we continue to make sizable investments in research, development and engineering, and in 2016, we expect to invest $205 million or 5% of sales. I want to highlight just a few of our recent new product introductions. 
Our Solartron Analytical business, a global leader in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for materials and electrochemical research has added 4 new application-specific instruments to their Apps-XM Series of Laboratory Instruments. The XM stands for extreme measurement and each new instrument was developed with specific capabilities for highly targeted research applications. Each occupies less than half the print -- footprint of similar laboratory instruments and provides increased measurement performance. These instruments are used for testing energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as for testing materials used in photovoltaic and solar cell applications. 
AMETEK's Aerospace & Defense developed a patent pending Exhaust Gas Thermocouple with a sheet made from an advanced and ceramic matrix composite. The Thermocouple is used to measure temperature in jet engine exhaust gases, and its highly advanced ceramic matrix heating extends the thermocouple's high temperature performance range. The heating material is 1/3 a stent of steel and nickel alloys, exhibits better performance than pure ceramic materials and extends the life of a thermocouple doubling to postpone costly jet engine overhauls. 
Our Vision Research business, which is the leader in high-speed imaging systems, unveiled its new family of Phantom VIO high-speed cameras. These compact rugged cameras are designed for a wide range of applications, including scientific analysis, material testing and defense research. The VIO family includes 8 individual models across 4 performance levels and 2 body styles providing users the flexibility for their specific needs. These high-speed high-resolution cameras are packed full of features in a 5-inch tube that is designed for durability and could stand up to 100Gs of force.
These investments in research and development combined with our strong engineering talent across the company are driving excellent new product development results. 
Revenue from new products introduced over the last 3 years, our vitality index was an excellent 25% in the quarter. 
We also remain focused on driving our Operational Excellence strategy. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tool-kit. 
Overall in 2016, we expect to generate $130 million in total Operational Excellence savings. These Operational Excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing and strategic procurement, value analysis and value engineering, design for Six Sigma and the movement of production to low cost locales. These OPEX initiatives also includes various tools that are focused on the front-end of our business. As I noted last quarter, we are focused on leveraging and broadening tools in this area across all of our businesses to ensure we are properly positioned for long-term growth. 
Now I'll return to the outlook for the balance of the year. Our expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect 2016 revenue to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single-digits. We have tightened our guidance range for 2016 to a range of approximately $2.29 to $2.31 per diluted share, leaving the midpoint of the guidance unchanged at $2.30. 
Fourth quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2015, with earnings of approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
In summary, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our full year sales guidance and the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We have acquired 5 high-quality businesses in 2016 and our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is excellent. We generate strong free cash flow and has the balance sheet flexibility to continue to acquire great businesses. We remain focused on aggressively managing our businesses in the short term while ensuring we make appropriate investments to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. We have a deep and talented management team that will continue to execute our 4 growth strategies. 
I'm very bullish on the future of AMETEK and believe we all are well positioned to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. 
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details and provide more information on our private placement. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our business has performed well in the third quarter, with solid results that met our expectations. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were down roughly in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's third quarter on higher consultant costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from last year's rate of 26.1%. We continue to expect our tax rate for 2016 to be between 26% and 27%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. 
Working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $42 million, and for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $165 million. 
Operating cash flow was $169 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $154 million, representing 118% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be strong 125% of net income. 
We've been very active deploying our free cash flow this year. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $65 million on the acquisitions of NU Instruments and HS Foils, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $32 million on the acquisition of Laserage. 
These acquisitions from our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $390 million. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for approximately $100 million. 
The highest priority for our cash flow remains acquisitions. However, as we have shown, we will look to opportunistically deploy our cash flow on share buybacks. 
Total debt at September 30 was $2.15 billion, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. 
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $445 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 34%. 
At September 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
As we announced this morning, we entered into a private placement on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes. We are issuing EUR 500 million and GBP 225 million, all with maturities ranging from 10 to 15 years. The proceeds of this offering will be used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay a GBP 40 million note due later this month. 
The private placement was well received by our lenders. Overall, decision once had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and a weighted average maturity of 11.5 years. This offering provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our business is managed very well in the third quarter in the face of challenging market conditions. We remain active in deploying capital and are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?"

We did see some weaker growth on our Aerospace segment, mainly because of the business in regional jet markets slowed a bit. But it was a bit stronger growth in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. So when you look at the whole picture during Q3 has played out largely as we had expected. If you recall, we get a deep dive at the end of the second quarter to reforecast, and it turned out exactly as we thought. In terms of orders, we -- the organic order rates in the quarter were minus 3.5%. So the organic sales were down 8%, so we got some momentum.

We continue to see strong growth on our commercial OEM business. We won excellent content across a wide number of next-generation commercial aircraft platforms, and we're really well positioned to benefit from the discontinued growth. Our business in regional jet business continues to be weak. And the military was down a bit in the quarter due to program timing. So for all of 2016, we expect aerospace sales to be down low single digits, saw the growth in our commercial OEM business has offset largely by weakness in the business in regional jet. Jumping into the process segment, organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and driven by weakness across our oil and gas businesses. We did see stabilization with our oil and gas businesses during the quarter as we expected, and we expect this stabilization to continue through the fourth quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technologies, our UPT, business, again, had a very strong quarter, with good growth across our businesses and as a result of the new product rollouts and global and new market expansion initiatives, that was a very positive quarter. For all of 2016, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be down mid- to high-single digits, driven largely by oil and gas. Our sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by the contributions from acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down low double digits in the quarter, driven by a difficult prior year comparison. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for power and industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. Organic sales for differentiated EMG businesses were down mid-single digits, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We are starting to see stabilization in this business also as expected like oil and gas. For all of differentiated EMG, we continued to expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. Floorcare & Specialty Motors, the last segment, the smallest segments, organic sales were down high single digits in the third quarter, driven by softer demand across key markets and for all of 2016, we expect sales for this business to be down mid-single digits organically unchanged from the previous expectations. When you look at it from the group level, for all of our EIG, it's unchanged from prior guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect overall sales to be down both single digits with organic sales down mid-single digits due to same for EMG, it's the same as prior guidance we provided last quarter, with both overall and organic sales down mid-single digits. And for all of AMETEK, our guidance remains unchanged, with overall sales expected to be down low-single digits and organic sales down mid-single digits."

The majority of that is in Electronic Instruments still in our Process segment. As the year played out, that business is going to be down about 33% or down about $120 million. That's with a 60% decline in our upstream business and a 60% decline in our mid and downstream businesses. So if you go back to -- at the peak, our upstream sales are down about 70% tied to the rig count decline, and our midstream and downstream businesses are down about 20%, driven by cost of capital spending and delayed maintenance work. So we saw that the peak in 2014, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. We got into -- in 2015, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. In 2016, we saw a continuing decline in the upstream, and then flowing through the midstream, and we end up down about 1/3 again. We're about $240 million coming out of 2016. We look at it, what I feel good about it when I look at the order rates. I mean, the order rates for our businesses are supporting a flat Q4 largely in the -- I'd say, kind of a longer backlog business with some short term MRO business, but I feel good about the backlog we have entering the quarter. When I think about the beginning of the year, we were down large percentages in oil and gas, 35% in Q1, about the same in Q2. In Q3, we're down about 20%, and we think that'll continue to wore down even less in Q4. So the sequential run rate in the business definitely have stabilized, our order rates have stabilized, and I think we took a good look at it at the end of Q2, and it feels the same right now."

And if you look at our trend, it's really been that way for the last 3 quarters. We've had about low double-digit, 10% decline the last 3 quarters, so it's stabilized at that level. If we jump over to Europe, it was down low-single digits in line with recent trends there. We've been down to low-single digits for the better part of the year. Asia was the one positive. It was up 1% organically. That was -- if you think back over the past 1, 1.5 years, it was down low double digits, and down low double digits, down 10% down mid-single digits sequentially in quarters, now it's up 1%. And China, the biggest driver in Asia, was down slightly, so down about 1%. So we feel pretty good about Asia. We had good performance in Japan, in Korea and some other markets, so it was up 1% organically. When you go to the BRIC countries, overall, the BRIC countries are 11% of sales. We've been very successful historically in the BRIC countries, but the emerging markets are challenged right now. Our emerging market exposure is dominated by China, it's the largest, by far. And as I already mentioned, we were down about 1%. But when you look at places like Brazil and Russia, they were down very significant double digits, 20%-plus in each of those markets. And India has been a different story, it's been growing at mid-single digit rates. This quarter, it was a little different, it was down a bit, about 20%, but that's more from large program orders. We don't really have a base business in India yet, but it'll bounce around, but I really see that trend continuing.

So we expected it, so along with that price effect, we have -- which has been very difficult in the markets that are unaddressed that we talk a lot of about like oil and gas and metals, you'll also have a mix effect that where people are buying down the product line. So those would be the 2 big factors that I would see. And I think as the market stabilizes that we'll see slow migration back up to the high end of the portfolio, and we expect to get positive price. So we've -- our pricing was greater than total inflation in the business by a bit in the quarter, so we've been able to offset our total inflation, and it's not a good pricing environment.

It's still absolute, and returns and pricing on deals, and the pipeline that we have is better than it has been in the past, and I feel positive that we'll be able to deploy the cash and unused revolver capacity to get some deal done moving forward. Now we can't predict when deals happen in any quarter or because we have to finish our diligence and have to get through a lot of things, but we have a lot of activity going on and our teams are active and working in many processes. So I'm optimistic that some of that will turn into positive, and we'll be able to deploy some of our cash."

We don't have exposure to some of the markets, in which, have been growing recently like the construction markets, nonresidential construction or residential construction. We don't have a big exposure to consumer market. We have a limited exposure to the auto market. All these markets are cyclical as well, but they're doing well right now and we'll cycle down at some point in the future.

Dave, as you are going through the budget process for 2017, obviously, you're going to tend very carefully to the organic situation, which it does not look like your organic sales have declined more than your end markets have, particularly in the 2 businesses that have been problematic. But I think historically, the view has been that because of the types of businesses that you're in, that they would not decline as much as the end market. That does not seem to be the case, so really 2 question stem from that. Number one, what is the plan for those businesses to sort of make them outperformers in their market? And secondly, as you approach organic in the other businesses, is there more of a portfolio change that might be needed here more towards the faster-growing businesses end market that you've purchased in recent years and maybe away from some of the more basic industrial ones that you kind of took with you from last decade?"

As I mentioned before, our strategy is to plan a broad set of diverse niche markets and we love to grow and expand these niches. So and really the diversification is the key point. We don't want to get overexposed in any one single market. And even though we've had tremendous headwinds in oil and gas metals market, we're still a very profitable company. Some of the best margins in the industrial space. So that the diversity is serving us well there. When you think about the parts of our portfolio that we're doing well and I mentioned our UPT business, I mentioned medical space, I mentioned commercial OEM aerospace, those are in the acquisition queue with all the other business. So we like to acquire more businesses in those areas for sure. When you -- to answer the first part of your question saying, I'm actually pleased with the performance of our businesses and the cyclical markets, the oil and gas and metals business, we've leaned out the cost structures, those are excellent businesses with excellent niche positions, and I'm not sure of how the organic growth is going to play out, but I can tell you, when it comes back, we're going to make a lot of money because those cost structures are leaned out. And regarding the organic growth of the company, I mentioned last quarter that we want to focus on the organic growth and making sure we're getting our fair share of the business and really focus on the front-end of the business and get as good in our sales and marketing functions as we earn our operational functions. So we need our customer facing capabilities to equal our strong operational capabilities, and we're working on that by looking at best practices and tools around our company and doing the same thing we did in the operations of applying them through our entire business. So we're focusing on key initiatives in that area, and that's largely driven from the fact that the next 5 years we might not be able to -- if you think back from 2005 to 2015, AMETEK grew 3% compounded annual growth rate and organic growth. We grew 8% in M&A, so 11% top line, and we've got 16% compound annual growth and EPS to the bottom line. If you want to continue that over the next few years, the next 5 years, which we clearly do, we're just going to take some average to work on organic growth across the company to make sure that we can outperform in that area. We're not talking about a meaningful change in it or ot a needle mover long term. Certainly, not a benefit in 2017. But in 2018, I hope we'll see some benefits of some slightly better organic growth."

We feel business conditions across our most challenging markets are beginning to stabilize. Although we remain cautious about the short-term demand environment, we are encouraged with this stabilization. 
Also, I am pleased to announce that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Laserage Technology, a provider of laser-based fabrication services for the medical device industry, and an excellent fit with our engineered medical components business. 
With this acquisition, we have now acquired 5 businesses so far in 2016 and have deployed approximately $390 million in capital. We also deployed approximately $100 million on share repurchases during the third quarter. 
To support our capital deployment activities, we announced today that we entered into a private placement agreement to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes at attractive rates. We'll provide more detail on the recent acquisition and our private placement later. But as these activities show, AMETEK remains committed to the disciplined deployment of capital. 
Now let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations in the third quarter at $945 million, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 8% while acquisitions added 3%. The impact from foreign currency in the quarter was negligible. 
Operating income in the quarter was $201.1 million and operating income margin was 21.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, down 14% over last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. First, Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $579.3 million were down 3% versus last year's third quarter. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was flat. 
The strong acquisition growth was driven by the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments and HS Foils. The organic sales decline was driven in part by weakness across our oil and gas markets. Results for our oil and gas businesses were as expected, with conditions beginning to stabilize across each of our upstream, midstream and downstream businesses. 
EIG's operating income in the third quarter was $142.7 million, and operating income margins were 24.6%. 
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $365.7 million, down 9% versus the third quarter of last year, with organic sales down 7%, and foreign currency at 1% headwind. The largest driver of the sales weakness was our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. This business has also began to stabilize, and we expect to see similar conditions in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. 
EMG's operating income was $71.4 million in the quarter and operating margins were 19.5%. 
Now let me provide some background on the acquisition we announced this morning. Laserage is a leading provider of laser fabrication services to the medical device market. They offer precision tube fabrication of minimally-invasive surgical devices, stents, specialty catheters and catheter-based delivery systems. They also have excellent design capabilities for medical devices. 
Laserage is an excellent addition to our growing presence in the medical industry. It is a great strategic fit with our engineered medical components business as it provides excellent market and technology synergies. 
In addition, the business operates in markets and applications with strong growth characteristics. Laserage was privately held. It was headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois, with the manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. 
Laserage has annual sales of $22 million. I would like to welcome the team from Laserage to AMETEK. 
We remain very active in identifying and executing highly strategic acquisitions across our businesses. The pipeline of acquisitions remains very solid, and our teams continued to do an outstanding job supporting our M&A efforts. 
In addition to our continued focus on investing in strategic acquisitions, we continue to make investments to support long-term organic growth. 
In particular, we continue to make sizable investments in research, development and engineering, and in 2016, we expect to invest $205 million or 5% of sales. I want to highlight just a few of our recent new product introductions. 
Our Solartron Analytical business, a global leader in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for materials and electrochemical research has added 4 new application-specific instruments to their Apps-XM Series of Laboratory Instruments. The XM stands for extreme measurement and each new instrument was developed with specific capabilities for highly targeted research applications. Each occupies less than half the print -- footprint of similar laboratory instruments and provides increased measurement performance. These instruments are used for testing energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as for testing materials used in photovoltaic and solar cell applications. 
AMETEK's Aerospace & Defense developed a patent pending Exhaust Gas Thermocouple with a sheet made from an advanced ceramic matrix composite. The Thermocouple is used to measure temperature in jet engine exhaust gases, and its highly advanced ceramic matrix heating extends the thermocouple's high temperature performance range. The heating material is 1/3 a stent of steel and nickel alloys, exhibits better performance than pure ceramic materials and extends the life of the thermocouple helping to postpone costly jet engine overhauls. 
Our Vision Research business, which is the leader in high-speed imaging systems, unveiled its new family of Phantom VIO high-speed cameras. These compact rugged cameras are designed for a wide range of applications, including scientific analysis, material testing and defense research. The VIO family includes 8 individual models across 4 performance levels and 2 body styles providing users with flexibility for their specific needs. These high-speed high-resolution cameras are packed full of features in a 5-inch tube that is designed for durability equal to stand up to 100Gs of force.
These investments in research and development combined with our strong engineering talent across the company are driving excellent new product development results. 
Revenue from new products introduced over the last 3 years -- our vitality index -- was an excellent 25% in the quarter. 
We also remain focused on driving our Operational Excellence strategy. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tool-kit. 
Overall in 2016, we expect to generate $130 million in total Operational Excellence savings. These Operational Excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing and strategic procurement, value analysis and value engineering, design for Six Sigma and the movement of production to low cost locales. These OPEX initiatives also include various tools that are focused on the front-end of our business. As I noted last quarter, we are focused on leveraging and broadening tools in this area across all of our businesses to ensure we are properly positioned for long-term growth. 
Now I'll return to the outlook for the balance of the year. Our expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect 2016 revenue to be down low-single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single-digits. We have tightened our guidance range for 2016 to a range of approximately $2.29 to $2.31 per diluted share, leaving the midpoint of the guidance unchanged at $2.30. 
Fourth quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2015, with earnings of approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
In summary, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our full year sales guidance and the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We have acquired 5 high-quality businesses in 2016 and our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is excellent. We generated strong free cash flow and have the balance sheet flexibility to continue to acquire great businesses. We remain focused on aggressively managing our businesses in the short term while ensuring we make appropriate investments to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. We have a deep and talented management team that will continue to execute our 4 growth strategies. 
I'm very bullish on the future of AMETEK and believe we all are well positioned to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. 
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details and provide more information on our private placement. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our business has performed well in the third quarter, with solid results that met our expectations. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were down roughly in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's third quarter on higher consulting costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from last year's rate of 26.1%. We continue to expect our tax rate for 2016 to be between 26% and 27%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. 
Working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $42 million, and for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $165 million. 
Operating cash flow was $169 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $154 million, representing 118% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be a strong 125% of net income. 
We've been very active deploying our free cash flow this year. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $65 million on the acquisitions of Nu Instruments and HS Foils, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $32 million on the acquisition of Laserage. 
These acquisitions bring our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $390 million. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for approximately $100 million. 
The highest priority for our cash flow remains acquisitions. However, as we have shown, we will look to opportunistically deploy our cash flow on share buybacks. 
Total debt at September 30 was $2.15 billion, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. 
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $445 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 34%. 
At September 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
As we announced this morning, we entered into a private placement on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes. We are issuing EUR 500 million and GBP 225 million, all with maturities ranging from 10 to 15 years. The proceeds of this offering will be used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay a GBP 40 million note due later this month. 
The private placement was well received by our lenders. Overall this issuance had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and a weighted average maturity of 11.5 years. This offering provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our business is managed very well in the third quarter in the face of challenging market conditions. We remain active in deploying capital and are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?"

I think we said, we'd be down mid-single digits, and we were down 5%. And so it's right on. Organic sales were down close to 7.5%, which is very close to our expectations. We did see some weaker growth on our Aerospace segment, mainly because of the business in regional jet markets slowed a bit. But it was a bit stronger growth in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. So when you look at the whole picture during Q3 it played out largely as we had expected. If you recall, we did a deep dive at the end of the second quarter to reforecast, and it turned out exactly as we thought. In terms of orders, we -- the organic order rates in the quarter were minus 3.5%. So the organic sales were down 8%, so we got some momentum. Book-to-bill was 1.02 and the orders trended up in the quarter. So we're feeling good going into Q4."

We continue to see strong growth on our commercial OEM business. We won excellent content across a wide number of next-generation commercial aircraft platforms, and we're really well positioned to benefit from the discontinued growth. Our business in regional jet business continues to be weak. And the military was down a bit in the quarter due to program timing. So for all of 2016, we expect aerospace sales to be down low single digits, saw the growth in our commercial OEM businesses offset largely by weakness in the business in regional jet. Jumping into the process segment, organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and driven by weakness across our oil and gas businesses. We did see stabilization with our oil and gas businesses during the quarter as we expected, and we expect this stabilization to continue through the fourth quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technologies, our UPT, business, again, had a very strong quarter, with good growth across our businesses and as a result of the new product rollouts and global and new market expansion initiatives, that was a very positive quarter. For all of 2016, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be down mid- to high-single digits, driven largely by oil and gas. Our sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by the contributions from acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down low double digits in the quarter, driven by a difficult prior year comparison. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for power and industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. Organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were down mid-single digits, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Material, Interconnects and Packaging business. We are starting to see stabilization in this business also as expected, like oil and gas. For all of differentiated EMG, we continued to expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. Floorcare & Specialty Motors, the last segment, the smallest segments, organic sales were down high single digits in the third quarter, driven by softer demand across key markets and for all of 2016, we expect sales for this business to be down mid-single digits organically unchanged from the previous expectations. When you look at it from the group level, for all of EIG, it's unchanged from prior guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect overall sales to be down both single digits with organic sales down mid-single digits. Do the same for EMG, it's the same as prior guidance we provided last quarter, with both overall and organic sales down mid-single digits. And for all of AMETEK, our guidance remains unchanged, with overall sales expected to be down low-single digits and organic sales down mid-single digits."

The majority of that is in Electronic Instruments still in our Process segment. As the year played out, that business is going to be down about 33% or down about $120 million. That's a -- we had a 60% decline in our upstream business and a 60% decline in our mid and downstream businesses. So if you go back to -- at the peak, our upstream sales are down about 70% tied to the rig count decline, and our midstream and downstream businesses are down about 20%, driven by cost of capital spending and delayed maintenance work. So we saw that the peak in 2014, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. We got into -- in 2015, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. In 2016, we saw a continuing decline in the upstream, and then flowing through the midstream, and we end up down about 1/3 again. We're about $240 million coming out of 2016. We look at it -- when I feel good about it when I look at the order rates. I mean, the order rates for our businesses are supporting a flat Q4 largely in the -- I'd say, kind of a longer backlog business with some short term MRO business, but I feel good about the backlog we have entering the quarter. When I think about the beginning of the year, we were down large percentages in oil and gas, 35% in Q1, about the same in Q2. In Q3, we're down about 20%, and we think that'll continue until we're down even less in Q4. So the sequential run rates in the business definitely have stabilized, our order rates have stabilized, and I think we took a good look at it at the end of Q2, and it feels the same right now."

So we're -- again, we're going to get detailed insight from our businesses, but one thing that we're sure of is that any small increase on organic growth, we've leaned the cost structure of these businesses out.

I'll start with the U.S. We were down low double digits versus the prior year, and it was driven by broad industrial weakness, but the key factor is  driving a negative growth for oil and gas and metals. And if you look at our trend, it's really been that way for the last 3 quarters. We've had about low double-digit, 10% decline the last 3 quarters, so it's stabilized at that level. If we jump over to Europe, it was down low-single digits in line with recent trends there. We've been down to low-single digits for the better part of the year. Asia was the one positive. It was up 1% organically. That was -- if you think back over the past 1, 1.5 years, it was down low-double digits, and down low-double digits, down 10%, down mid-single digits sequentially in quarters, now it's up 1%. And China, the biggest driver in Asia, was down slightly, so down about 1%. So we feel pretty good about Asia. We had good performance in Japan, in Korea and some other markets, so it was up 1% organically. When you go to the BRIC countries, overall, the BRIC countries are 11% of sales. We've been very successful historically in the BRIC countries, but the emerging markets are challenged right now. Our emerging market exposure is dominated by China, it's the largest, by far. And as I already mentioned, we were down about 1%. But when you look at places like Brazil and Russia, they were down very significant double digits, 20%-plus in each of those markets. And India has been a different story, it's been growing at mid-single digit rates. This quarter, it was a little different, it was down a bit, about 20%, but that's more from large program orders. We don't really have a base business in India yet, but it'll bounce around, but I really see that trend continuing.

The places where our business are -- that seasonality plays out is our Process businesses, and we're seeing as order entry rates indicate that that's going to happen, a little bit of our power business has a bit of seasonality. So when you look across our portfolio, we have businesses that have a bit of seasonality. It's built into the forecast.

Because of our strong niche market positions, I definitely feel that we have pricing power in our business. What you saw this year is a lot of migration to lower capability products within our portfolio. So instead of buying the high-end product that can do just about everything with all the bells and whistles, the customers migrated to more basic functionality. And that really happened in the last downturn, back in 2009 also. So we expected it, so along with that price effect, we have -- which has been very difficult in the markets that are unaddressed that we talk a lot of about like oil and gas and metals, you'll also have a mix effect that where people are buying down the product line. So those would be the 2 big factors that I would see. And I think as the market stabilizes that we'll see slow migration back up to the high end of the portfolio, and we expect to get positive price. So we've -- our pricing was greater than total inflation in the business by a bit in the quarter, so we've been able to offset our total inflation, and it's not a good pricing environment. If I look back a couple of years, we were getting 2 points a price, so it's definitely down but we're pricing in excess of inflation and I think that will improve as the general economic global -- macroeconomic trends improve."

As I mentioned before, our strategy is to plan a broad set of diverse niche markets and we love to grow and expand these niches. So and really the diversification is the key point. We don't want to get overexposed to any one single market. And even though we've had tremendous headwinds in oil and gas metals market, we're still a very profitable company. Some of the best margins in the industrial space. So the diversity is serving us well there. When you think about the parts of our portfolio that we're doing well in and I mentioned our UPT business, I mentioned the medical space, I mentioned commercial OEM aerospace, those are in the acquisition queue with all the other business. So we like to acquire more businesses in those areas for sure. When you -- to answer the first part of your question saying, I'm actually pleased with the performance of our businesses and the cyclical markets, the oil and gas and metals business, we've leaned out the cost structures, those are excellent businesses with excellent niche positions, and I'm not sure of how the organic growth is going to play out, but I can tell you, when it comes back, we're going to make a lot of money because those cost structures are leaned out. And regarding the organic growth of the company, I mentioned last quarter that we want to focus on the organic growth and making sure we're getting our fair share of the business and really focus on the front-end of the business and get as good in our sales and marketing functions as we are in our operational functions. So we need our customer facing capabilities to equal our strong operational capabilities, and we're working on that by looking at best practices and tools around our company and doing the same thing we did in the operations of applying them through our entire business. So we're focusing on key initiatives in that area, and that's largely driven from the fact that the next 5 years we might not be able to -- if you think back from 2005 to 2015, AMETEK grew 3% compounded annual growth rate and organic growth. We grew 8% in M&A, so 11% top line, and we've got 16% compound annual growth and EPS to the bottom line. If you want to continue that over the next few years, the next 5 years, which we clearly do, we're just going to take some efforts to work on organic growth across the company to make sure that we can outperform in that area. We're not talking about a meaningful change in it or not a needle mover long term. Certainly, not any benefit in 2017. But in 2018, I hope we'll see some benefits of some slightly better organic growth."

We feel business conditions across our most challenging markets are beginning to stabilize. Although we remain cautious about the short-term demand environment, we are encouraged with this stabilization. 
Also, I am pleased to announce that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Laserage Technology, a provider of laser-based fabrication services for the medical device industry, and an excellent fit with our engineered medical components business. 
With this acquisition, we have now acquired 5 businesses so far in 2016 and have deployed approximately $390 million in capital. We also deployed approximately $100 million on share repurchases during the third quarter. 
To support our capital deployment activities, we announced today that we entered into a private placement agreement to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes at attractive rates. We'll provide more detail on the recent acquisition and our private placement later. But as these activities show, AMETEK remains committed to the disciplined deployment of capital. 
Now let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations in the third quarter at $945 million, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 8% while acquisitions added 3%. The impact from foreign currency in the quarter was negligible. 
Operating income in the quarter was $201.1 million and operating income margin was 21.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, down 14% over last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. First, Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $579.3 million were down 3% versus last year's third quarter. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was flat. 
The strong acquisition growth was driven by the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments and HS Foils. The organic sales decline was driven in part by weakness across our oil and gas markets. Results for our oil and gas businesses were as expected, with conditions beginning to stabilize across each of our upstream, midstream and downstream businesses. 
EIG's operating income in the third quarter was $142.7 million, and operating income margins were 24.6%. 
The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $365.7 million, down 9% versus the third quarter of last year, with organic sales down 7%, and foreign currency at 1% headwind. The largest driver of the sales weakness was our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. This business has also began to stabilize, and we expect to see similar conditions in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. 
EMG's operating income was $71.4 million in the quarter and operating margins were 19.5%. 
Now let me provide some background on the acquisition we announced this morning. Laserage is a leading provider of laser fabrication services to the medical device market. They offer precision tube fabrication of minimally-invasive surgical devices, stents, specialty catheters and catheter-based delivery systems. They also have excellent design capabilities for medical devices. 
Laserage is an excellent addition to our growing presence in the medical industry. It is a great strategic fit with our engineered medical components business as it provides excellent market and technology synergies. 
In addition, the business operates in markets and applications with strong growth characteristics. Laserage was privately held. It was headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois, with the manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. 
Laserage has annual sales of $22 million. I would like to welcome the team from Laserage to AMETEK. 
We remain very active in identifying and executing highly strategic acquisitions across our businesses. The pipeline of acquisitions remains very solid, and our teams continued to do an outstanding job supporting our M&A efforts. 
In addition to our continued focus on investing in strategic acquisitions, we continue to make investments to support long-term organic growth. 
In particular, we continue to make sizable investments in research, development and engineering, and in 2016, we expect to invest $205 million or 5% of sales. I want to highlight just a few of our recent new product introductions. 
Our Solartron Analytical business, a global leader in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for materials and electrochemical research has added 4 new application-specific instruments to their Apps-XM Series of Laboratory Instruments. The XM stands for extreme measurement and each new instrument was developed with specific capabilities for highly targeted research applications. Each occupies less than half the print -- footprint of similar laboratory instruments and provides increased measurement performance. These instruments are used for testing energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as for testing materials used in photovoltaic and solar cell applications. 
AMETEK's Aerospace & Defense developed a patent pending Exhaust Gas Thermocouple with a sheet made from an advanced ceramic matrix composite. The Thermocouple is used to measure temperature in jet engine exhaust gases, and its highly advanced ceramic matrix heating extends the thermocouple's high temperature performance range. The heating material is 1/3 a stent of steel and nickel alloys, exhibits better performance than pure ceramic materials and extends the life of the thermocouple helping to postpone costly jet engine overhauls. 
Our Vision Research business, which is the leader in high-speed imaging systems, unveiled its new family of Phantom VIO high-speed cameras. These compact rugged cameras are designed for a wide range of applications, including scientific analysis, material testing and defense research. The VIO family includes 8 individual models across 4 performance levels and 2 body styles providing users with flexibility for their specific needs. These high-speed high-resolution cameras are packed full of features in a 5-inch tube that is designed for durability equal to stand up to 100Gs of force.
These investments in research and development combined with our strong engineering talent across the company are driving excellent new product development results. 
Revenue from new products introduced over the last 3 years -- our vitality index -- was an excellent 25% in the quarter. 
We also remain focused on driving our Operational Excellence strategy. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging our Operational Excellence tool-kit. 
Overall in 2016, we expect to generate $130 million in total Operational Excellence savings. These Operational Excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing and strategic procurement, value analysis and value engineering, design for Six Sigma and the movement of production to low cost locales. These OPEX initiatives also include various tools that are focused on the front-end of our business. As I noted last quarter, we are focused on leveraging and broadening tools in this area across all of our businesses to ensure we are properly positioned for long-term growth. 
Now I'll return to the outlook for the balance of the year. Our expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect 2016 revenue to be down low-single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single-digits. We have tightened our guidance range for 2016 to a range of approximately $2.29 to $2.31 per diluted share, leaving the midpoint of the guidance unchanged at $2.30. 
Fourth quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2015, with earnings of approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share. 
In summary, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our full year sales guidance and the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We have acquired 5 high-quality businesses in 2016 and our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is excellent. We generated strong free cash flow and have the balance sheet flexibility to continue to acquire great businesses. We remain focused on aggressively managing our businesses in the short term while ensuring we make appropriate investments to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. We have a deep and talented management team that will continue to execute our 4 growth strategies. 
I'm very bullish on the future of AMETEK and believe we all are well positioned to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. 
Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details and provide more information on our private placement. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave noted, our business has performed well in the third quarter, with solid results that met our expectations. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were down roughly in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's third quarter on higher consulting costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from last year's rate of 26.1%. We continue to expect our tax rate for 2016 to be between 26% and 27%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. 
Working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.8% of sales in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $42 million, and for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $165 million. 
Operating cash flow was $169 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $154 million, representing 118% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be a strong 125% of net income. 
We've been very active deploying our free cash flow this year. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $65 million on the acquisitions of Nu Instruments and HS Foils, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $32 million on the acquisition of Laserage. 
These acquisitions bring our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $390 million. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for approximately $100 million. 
The highest priority for our cash flow remains acquisitions. However, as we have shown, we will look to opportunistically deploy our cash flow on share buybacks. 
Total debt at September 30 was $2.15 billion, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. 
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $445 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 34%. 
At September 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
As we announced this morning, we entered into a private placement on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes. We are issuing EUR 500 million and GBP 225 million, all with maturities ranging from 10 to 15 years. The proceeds of this offering will be used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay a GBP 40 million note due later this month. 
The private placement was well received by our lenders. Overall this issuance had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and a weighted average maturity of 11.5 years. This offering provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. 
In summary, our business is managed very well in the third quarter in the face of challenging market conditions. We remain active in deploying capital and are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?"

We did see some weaker growth on our Aerospace segment, mainly because of the business in regional jet markets slowed a bit. But it was a bit stronger growth in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. So when you look at the whole picture during Q3 it played out largely as we had expected. If you recall, we did a deep dive at the end of the second quarter to reforecast, and it turned out exactly as we thought. In terms of orders, we -- the organic order rates in the quarter were minus 3.5%. So the organic sales were down 8%, so we got some momentum.

We continue to see strong growth on our commercial OEM business. We won excellent content across a wide number of next-generation commercial aircraft platforms, and we're really well positioned to benefit from the discontinued growth. Our business in regional jet business continues to be weak. And the military was down a bit in the quarter due to program timing. So for all of 2016, we expect aerospace sales to be down low single digits, saw the growth in our commercial OEM businesses offset largely by weakness in the business in regional jet. Jumping into the process segment, organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and driven by weakness across our oil and gas businesses. We did see stabilization with our oil and gas businesses during the quarter as we expected, and we expect this stabilization to continue through the fourth quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technologies, our UPT, business, again, had a very strong quarter, with good growth across our businesses and as a result of the new product rollouts and global and new market expansion initiatives, that was a very positive quarter. For all of 2016, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be down mid- to high-single digits, driven largely by oil and gas. Our sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by the contributions from acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down low double digits in the quarter, driven by a difficult prior year comparison. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for power and industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. Organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were down mid-single digits, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Material, Interconnects and Packaging business. We are starting to see stabilization in this business also as expected, like oil and gas. For all of differentiated EMG, we continued to expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. Floorcare & Specialty Motors, the last segment, the smallest segments, organic sales were down high single digits in the third quarter, driven by softer demand across key markets and for all of 2016, we expect sales for this business to be down mid-single digits organically unchanged from the previous expectations. When you look at it from the group level, for all of EIG, it's unchanged from prior guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect overall sales to be down both single digits with organic sales down mid-single digits. Do the same for EMG, it's the same as prior guidance we provided last quarter, with both overall and organic sales down mid-single digits. And for all of AMETEK, our guidance remains unchanged, with overall sales expected to be down low-single digits and organic sales down mid-single digits."

That's a -- we had a 60% decline in our upstream business and a 60% decline in our mid and downstream businesses. So if you go back to -- at the peak, our upstream sales are down about 70% tied to the rig count decline, and our midstream and downstream businesses are down about 20%, driven by cost of capital spending and delayed maintenance work. So we saw that the peak in 2014, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. We got into -- in 2015, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. In 2016, we saw a continuing decline in the upstream, and then flowing through the midstream, and we end up down about 1/3 again. We're about $240 million coming out of 2016. We look at it -- when I feel good about it when I look at the order rates. I mean, the order rates for our businesses are supporting a flat Q4 largely in the -- I'd say, kind of a longer backlog business with some short term MRO business, but I feel good about the backlog we have entering the quarter. When I think about the beginning of the year, we were down large percentages in oil and gas, 35% in Q1, about the same in Q2. In Q3, we're down about 20%, and we think that'll continue until we're down even less in Q4. So the sequential run rates in the business definitely have stabilized, our order rates have stabilized, and I think we took a good look at it at the end of Q2, and it feels the same right now."

I'll start with the U.S. We were down low double digits versus the prior year, and it was driven by broad industrial weakness, but the key factor is  driving a negative growth for oil and gas and metals. And if you look at our trend, it's really been that way for the last 3 quarters. We've had about low double-digit, 10% decline the last 3 quarters, so it's stabilized at that level. If we jump over to Europe, it was down low-single digits in line with recent trends there. We've been down to low-single digits for the better part of the year. Asia was the one positive. It was up 1% organically. That was -- if you think back over the past 1, 1.5 years, it was down low-double digits, and down low-double digits, down 10%, down mid-single digits sequentially in quarters, now it's up 1%. And China, the biggest driver in Asia, was down slightly, so down about 1%. So we feel pretty good about Asia. We had good performance in Japan, in Korea and some other markets, so it was up 1% organically. When you go to the BRIC countries, overall, the BRIC countries are 11% of sales. We've been very successful historically in the BRIC countries, but the emerging markets are challenged right now. Our emerging market exposure is dominated by China, it's the largest, by far. And as I already mentioned, we were down about 1%. But when you look at places like Brazil and Russia, they were down very significant double digits, 20%-plus in each of those markets. And India has been a different story, it's been growing at mid-single digit rates. This quarter, it was a little different, it was down a bit, about 20%, but that's more from large program orders. We don't really have a base business in India yet, but it'll bounce around, but I really see that trend continuing. So basically in BRIC countries, we have China stabilized, that's the biggest market. India on a slow growth path and Brazil and Russia in the dumps."

Because of our strong niche market positions, I definitely feel that we have pricing power in our business. What you saw this year is a lot of migration to lower capability products within our portfolio. So instead of buying the high-end product that can do just about everything with all the bells and whistles, the customers migrated to more basic functionality. And that really happened in the last downturn, back in 2009 also. So we expected it, so along with that price effect, we have -- which has been very difficult in the markets that are unaddressed that we talk a lot of about like oil and gas and metals, you'll also have a mix effect that where people are buying down the product line. So those would be the 2 big factors that I would see. And I think as the market stabilizes that we'll see slow migration back up to the high end of the portfolio, and we expect to get positive price. So we've -- our pricing was greater than total inflation in the business by a bit in the quarter, so we've been able to offset our total inflation, and it's not a good pricing environment. If I look back a couple of years, we were getting 2 points a price, so it's definitely down but we're pricing in excess of inflation and I think that will improve as the general economic global -- macroeconomic trends improve."

So we don't want to become overexposed in any one single market. In fact, we have the same philosophy of any one single customer or any single technology, so we'll look to continue that balance. We don't have exposure to some of the markets, in which, have been growing recently like the construction markets, nonresidential construction or residential construction. We don't have a big exposure to consumer market. We have a limited exposure to the automotive market. All these markets are cyclical as well, but they're doing well right now and will cycle down at some point in the future. So the way I look at it, we weathered the worst of the cyclical market downturns in oil and gas and metals. Our cost structure has leaned out. Our businesses remain well-positioned in their niches, we have excellent niche positions. So we're very optimistic we're going to see sizable profit improvement when the market returns."

But I think historically, the view has been that because of the types of businesses that you're in, that they would not decline as much as the end market.

As I mentioned before, our strategy is to plan a broad set of diverse niche markets and we love to grow and expand these niches. So and really the diversification is the key point. We don't want to get overexposed to any one single market. And even though we've had tremendous headwinds in oil and gas metals market, we're still a very profitable company. Some of the best margins in the industrial space. So the diversity is serving us well there. When you think about the parts of our portfolio that we're doing well in and I mentioned our UPT business, I mentioned the medical space, I mentioned commercial OEM aerospace, those are in the acquisition queue with all the other business. So we like to acquire more businesses in those areas for sure. When you -- to answer the first part of your question saying, I'm actually pleased with the performance of our businesses and the cyclical markets, the oil and gas and metals business, we've leaned out the cost structures, those are excellent businesses with excellent niche positions, and I'm not sure of how the organic growth is going to play out, but I can tell you, when it comes back, we're going to make a lot of money because those cost structures are leaned out. And regarding the organic growth of the company, I mentioned last quarter that we want to focus on the organic growth and making sure we're getting our fair share of the business and really focus on the front-end of the business and get as good in our sales and marketing functions as we are in our operational functions. So we need our customer facing capabilities to equal our strong operational capabilities, and we're working on that by looking at best practices and tools around our company and doing the same thing we did in the operations of applying them through our entire business. So we're focusing on key initiatives in that area, and that's largely driven from the fact that the next 5 years we might not be able to -- if you think back from 2005 to 2015, AMETEK grew 3% compounded annual growth rate and organic growth. We grew 8% in M&A, so 11% top line, and we've got 16% compound annual growth and EPS to the bottom line. If you want to continue that over the next few years, the next 5 years, which we clearly do, we're just going to take some efforts to work on organic growth across the company to make sure that we can outperform in that area. We're not talking about a meaningful change in it or not a needle mover long term. Certainly, not any benefit in 2017. But in 2018, I hope we'll see some benefits of some slightly better organic growth."
