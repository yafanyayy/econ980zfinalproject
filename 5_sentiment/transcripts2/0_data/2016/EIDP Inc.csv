I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through to numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update on our plan to merger with Dow. 
The quarter came in a largely as expected, amid continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, including currency pressures. The progress we're making on the 3 critical initiatives I outlined last quarter contributed to the quarter and will serve us well in the future, regardless of macro conditions: Our cost structure, our working capital and our capital spending. 
First, on our cost structure. Cost reductions contributed $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter results providing $0.40 in savings for the full year from our operational redesign program. We also announced in December a new global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce 2016 costs by $700 million versus 2015, or $900 million on a run-rate basis. We have since identified an additional $100 million savings bringing our run rate total to $1 billion and increasing our 2016 savings to about $730 million. This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision making and connect even more closely to our end markets. That will sharpen our focus by giving the businesses more control over their PNLs and more agility to pursue growth. When we complete our cost savings program, our SG&A will reduce by about 15% on a run-rate basis in 2016.  Within that number, we are reducing our corporate costs by $200 million. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percentage of sales will reduce to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015. I want to emphasize that this program is a DuPont initiative, completely separate from the proposed merger with Dow. We took a clean slate approach to building the right organization for the future. The changes we are making would have occurred regardless of the planned merger. The changes will make our business is leaner, stronger competitors in every market where we do business. Importantly, these efforts are bringing even greater discipline and rigor to the investments we continue to make in the businesses to maintain our competitive advantage and better connect our science to the marketplace. The long-term success of our businesses will be driven by innovation and strong return on R&D investments. Our pipeline continues to deliver. Over the past quarter in Agriculture, we successfully launched Leptra corn hybrids for the safrinha season. Production plants for Leptra are on track for one of the fastest technology ramp ups in Pioneer history in the summer season. Our 2 newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and are expected to comprise over half of our North American corn sales volume in 2016. Qrome corn products continue to progress well towards commercialization. We will expand testing this coming summer in our IMPACT trials as we wait finally import approvals in key markets. 
Another example of where R&D is driving productive innovation is in Nutrition & Health. In the quarter, we saw volume growth in high-value products, including probiotics, cultures and ingredients systems. Demand for probiotics, primarily in the U.S., has been provided by our How Are You products, which promote respiratory health in children. Demand for cultures has been driven by Yulmix, which facilitates sugar reduction and delivers mouth feel and texture in yogurt. 
Next on our list of critical initiatives is working capital. Each of our businesses have set individual goals for improvement in working capital for 2016 from a bottoms-up approach. We also launched the company-wide project of working capital to look at it from the top down perspective. We are benchmarking our performance in payables, receivables and inventory against industry leaders, and believe the opportunity for improvement is significant, as much as $1 billion in the medium term. 
Our third area of focus is capital allocation. Our capital spending is guided by long-term goals, and that principle will not change. After looking hard at every project and its expected returns, we approved 2016 capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. That is down from about $1.4 billion in '15 and $1.5 billion in previous years, excluding Chemours. Our 2016 plan is more in line with our depreciation and amortization. 
In summary, all of these activities demonstrate our focus on strengthening DuPont, while creating sustainable shareholder value. Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."
268053,279121594,920697,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the fourth quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings per share of $0.27 were largely in line with our expectations. While we continued our disciplined focus on cost reductions and productivity, our results again",1692,"Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the fourth quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings per share of $0.27 were largely in line with our expectations. While we continued our disciplined focus on cost reductions and productivity, our results again, were significantly impacted by currency, challenges in Ag markets, particularly in Brazil, and the continued weakness in emerging markets. Segment results declined $0.23 per share in the quarter, including a $0.17 per share negative impact from currency, primarily the Brazilian real. Full year operating earnings per share were $2.77 versus $3.36 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.71 per share. Excluding the currency impact for the full year, operating EPS would have increased by 4%. 
Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.3 billion declined 1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by an additional 8 percentage points. The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to the segment results. Segment results, excluding currency, were down $0.06 per share year-over-year, as growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications. Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were a $0.04 headwind in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. A continued shift to a higher percentage of our earnings in the U.S. and Canada versus prior year resulted in this higher tax rate. While changes in corporate expense did not impact quarterly results, I would like to highlight that for the full year, decreases in corporate expenses contributed $0.09 to earnings reflecting our focus on cost reductions and productivity. 
Slide 4 illustrates our geographic footprints in the fourth quarter. Our sales in the U.S. and Canada continue to grow as a percentage of total sales, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in the remaining segments. Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 25% on cost reductions and continued productivity. Operating margins improved by 450 basis points. Volume growth in enzymes, particularly in food and home and personal care was offset by some declines in biomaterials. Nutrition & Health improvement was led by cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for probiotics, cultures and ingredients systems, which more than offset the negative currency impact. Operating margins in this segment improved by 110 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. In Agriculture, an operating loss of $54 million resulted in $188 million of lower operating earnings. Increases in local price, cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by $139 million negative currency impact. Prior year results benefited from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and a $36 million gain from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million. Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for Performance Polymers, offerings and global automotive markets was more than offset by lower ethylene price in volume, along with currency. Average ethylene spot prices are down over 60% year-over-year and continued to significantly impact both top line and bottom line segment results. 
Fourth quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand in currency. Demand from the oil and gas industry in the military segment remains soft, which impacted sales in Nomex thermal resistant fiber as well as Kevlar high strength materials and our Sustainable Solutions offerings. 
Electronics & Communications operating results decreased $5 million as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste. 
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under Events and Presentation. I encourage you to refer to these slides for further details on the segment results, including our expectations for the first quarter and full year 2016. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Let me start by explaining that our cash flow analysis includes Chemours for both 2015 and 2014. As you can see, on the slide, our free cash flow decreased about $1 billion from prior year. About $650 million of the decline related to the Chemours transaction. The remainder was due to lower cash earnings from ongoing businesses year-over-year. As Ed indicated, we're very focused on our cost structure, working capital discipline and capital spending, and our plans to address these areas as part of our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program should improve our free cash flow in 2016. 
We ended 2015 with a net debt of $2.6 billion versus $3.6 billion in 2014. The change from prior year is due to a decrease in gross debt year-over-year as a result of debt maturing during the year. Year end cash balances were about $6 billion. 
In the quarter, we completed the 2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. Onto the program, we received and retired about 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about $900 million and about $882 million for the fourth quarter. For 2016, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 875 million shares primarily reflecting the benefit of the 2015 share repurchases and the share repurchases scheduled in the second half of 2016. 
On Slide 7, our operational redesign program delivered $0.10 of savings in the quarter and $0.40 of cost savings for the full year 2015. This resulted in operating margin improvements in 5 out of our 6 segments for the full year. 
As we move into 2016, we will continue to aggressively focus on cost reduction in accordance with the plan we announced in December. As Ed mentioned, we have identified an additional $100 million of cost reductions increasing our total run rate savings to $1 billion, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in '16 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which will be weighted towards the second half of 2016 as we implement specific actions in the first and second quarters. 
Over $1 billion in run rate savings, about 3/4 will come from SG&A. Included in these reductions is a decrease of about $200 million in corporate expense. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percent of sales will improve to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015. 
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2016. These assumptions form the foundation for our 2016 guidance. As we saw in 2015, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a headwind for us again in 2016. We expect global growth of about 2% on an overall slowdown in global trade driven by weaknesses in emerging markets and, in particular, uncertainty in China. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2016. Europe continues to gradually improve and expand Manufacturing while the U.S. will be challenged due to tepid global demand and a stronger dollar. China slowing and uncertain remains a concern as we continue to see a shift from industrial production to services and consumer sectors. In Agriculture, the fundamentals remain challenging as net farming continues to decline. Auto growth is expected to continue with 3% year-over-year. 
With this backdrop, let's turn now to Slide 9. We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in Agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real.  Excluding currency, sales will be about even with prior year. The company expect 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales, excluding currency. Our guidance reflects a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The estimate also includes headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share of currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and $0.05 to $0.10 per share from a higher base tax rate, reflecting our expectations of the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to see slowing growth in emerging markets with shifting our earnings mixed to higher tax jurisdictions. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further weakening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Given the seasonality of our operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere, we anticipate approximately 2/3 of their expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016.  Excluding currency, we would expect earnings growth of 17% to 23%, including the full year benefit of cost savings and share repurchases. 
For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 23%, an increase from prior year due to geographic mix of earnings. This represents, as I mentioned, $0.05 to $0.10 headwind in the outlook. 
Benefits from a lower share count will be partially offset by higher interest cost in 2016. Interest expense will increase as a result of our reduced commercial paper market capacity. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.1 billion. Excluding Chemours, this represents about $300 million decline year-over-year and reflects our commitment to improving our capital allocation process as we scrutinize returns on a project-by-project basis. 
In 2016, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings, nonoperating pension and open cost as well as cost associated with the planned merger of equals. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Ed."

It's simple, we have 3. One, delivering growth and operating earnings. An important driver here is delivering the $1 billion in run rate cost savings and the organizational efficiencies that come with the restructuring. Equally important, we are placing a lot of emphasis on keeping the business steady and on track. Our people are very focused on connecting even more closely with customers to deliver the value-added solutions they expect from DuPont. Two is driving improved capital allocation and working capital performance to generate more cash and to enhance our returns. Three, closing the merger, planning for synergies and preparing for the intended separations. 
Let me now say a few words about the merger of equals with Dow, which we announced in December and which will be named DowDuPont. As we said at the time, we intend to combine 2 complementary portfolios to create 3 strong, highly-focused, independent businesses, well-equipped to deliver growth and long-term sustainable value. Each business will target attractive markets with combined science, technology and operational expertise will drive value for our stakeholders. We are focused on completing the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. We've identified the priority work streams and established our teams. We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. We are also focused on the preparation of the merged co-registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC. The initial filing will be made after each of DuPont Dow file their annual reports with the Commission in February. 
In December, we said that we expect the combined company to realize $3 billion in cost synergies. Each company has charted a dozen formal business and functional integration and synergy planning teams to develop detailed execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the companies post-merger and capture our anticipated costs and growth synergies.  The functional teams include legal, sourcing, logistics, supply chain, HR, finance, IT, facilities, among others. All of these teams are focused on planning for seamless business operations on day 1 after the merger and quickly capturing our planned synergies. These teams are charted to ensure we plan to leverage the most effective operating models, channels to market and industry-best practices upon the creation of DowDuPont. 
Just a few examples of the planning work teams are doing include reviewing our warehouse and facilities footprint, evaluating IT platforms for savings and developing integration plans for our transactional processes. 
As announced, we intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont into 3 separate public companies after our merger is complete: An Agriculture company, a Material Science company and a Specialty Products company. We are doing all that we can now to expedite the timing of the spins, including beginning work on the carveout financial statements for the separate companies. 
In conclusion, 2016 is a pivotal and transformational year for DuPont as we accelerate our value creation work, invest in our core franchises and position our businesses for competitive future. We will give you regular updates on our progress. Now I'll turn the call back over to Greg."

I'm a believer that they occur every year in a few percent range, as you keep streamlining your company. I would say -- so you're never done with it. I think where there were more cost evenings, David, in DuPont was when we could get up on a new IT platform because that would really streamline some of our G&A back-office. Unfortunately, we're not -- we're on a very fragmented IT system. One of the benefits it looks like we, obviously, get here with the Dow merger is Dow is on the IT platform that we were going to the global, I'd say, the latest revision of the SAP platform. And so between the work we did here on the back platform and the work they, obviously, already up on that platform, that's where -- let me just use the Ag company as an example. Their ag business is on the platform. That's where there will be cost savings. So I guess to back that up, if DuPont would have stayed on its own course over the next couple of years getting that platform up and running, that's where more cost will come out of the company mostly in the G&A area. But we'll get that benefit quicker in the merger if we can merge onto that platform. The teams have already met on that a couple of times. I actually sat in one of those things. I'm actually up in Midland at the Dow corporate office with the team, and we're feeling very bullish about that prospect to lean onto that platform."

We also look forward -- we got 2 genetic [indiscernible] in north, and so to look at our pricing book year-over-year for like products, we're about flat. I mean that's about the conversion to T Series soybeans in North America and the new genetics in corns, plus the launch of the continued launch of our products like Leptra in Brazil. That Leptra ramp up in [indiscernible] was good, but in summer corn, could be one of the largest ramp ups that we've had in our history. So it's going to be tough, it will be competitive, but we feel good about the lineup that we have going forward."

We're limited right now on our ability to enter the market because of the transaction that's going on, and we will have that limitation probably through the proxy vote. But then after that, we'll be looking to enter the marketplace on that. So when you add all that up, you're right. There is a higher cash drain versus the operating income. But we're also looking at driving some working capital improvements. This is an area that we have focused on. We have some improvements, slight improvement in our working capital turns this year. But what we're looking at attacking all 3-year areas: receivables, inventory, payables. And we believe if we can get to best-in-class into these areas then we can liberate another $1 billion-plus of cash in the medium term. So that's what we're driving our efforts."

So we're moving as fast as we can, and we did identified more,and so we're moving on that. The interesting thing on the $3 billion of the synergies with Dow, we have broken that out by all those key buckets we mentioned in our prepared remarks. The teams are meeting. As my comment was, one of our big opportunities is IT platform, that's why get personally involved in it because if we can overlay onto that, there's a huge opportunity. But if you look back at our charts, there's $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in ag that is very identified at this point in time, and there's so much overlap in the supply chain, the manufacturing chain, the sales chain. And by the way, the percentages we're talking about on the ag side are very similar to other transactions, to similar type companies there. And then we're in good shape, looking at the synergies on the specialty Company, a lot of that comes from the combination of the electronics businesses from Dow and DuPont coming together and the synergies. Then we have on the material side, our identified, we're still working and have a lot of opportunity is the purchasing supply chain. As I mention, the IT. And then we have a great opportunity to look at more shared services across the whole platform. And that's where hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could come from there. So it's the combination of all that. Now we're doing a lot of heavy lifting. And so, for instance, the supply chain area. Between the 2 companies, just to give you, we have hundreds of warehouses around the world, and we don't need that when we come together. So that is work you can't do in 1 week. That's going to take us the next 3 to 4 months literally identifying every single one and go where can we merge and converge together. So a little bit more heavy lifting on that supply chain purchasing, IT side. And then the shared services model we want to move forward lead of the back-office work, which will reduce our G&A. So I really plan and we're really pushing with the teams that we are totally identifying on the $3 billion minimum by the time you get to close of the merger so we can move immediately on it. And I would also say, I will be very hopeful that the $3 billion is our floor number and not the ceiling number. If we can get more out of that, then obviously, we're going to just move on."

If you think about 2016, just the overall total macroeconomics, we're predicting net farm income and net farm prices for growers to be challenged. You know from the past, as they start to make purchasing decisions, locking land and where they'll secure their seed and make sure they get the fertility programs right, and going to sort of back into what their crop protection regime is going to be. On top of that, for our own business, we're missing some volumes associated with the LaPorte incident. So that can evolve as to that picture. So overall, strong competitive market. I think on the offset there, we got a strong Crop Protection pipeline that continues to come forward. We're now into the full-blown launch of [indiscernible] peer. We'll expect to see some recovery peer volumes, especially in places like Asia-Pacific in vegetables. Our new fungicide, Zorvec, starting to get some traction on that and our new insecticide, Pyraxalt. So those are a couple of areas that would offset some of that in the downside. In Praxal, we're really just getting some testing going on that. The full launch of Praxal will be in 2017."

268053,279121594,920893,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update",756,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update on our plan to merger with Dow.
The quarter came in largely as expected amid continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, including currency pressures. The progress we are making on the 3 critical initiatives I outlined last quarter contributed to the quarter and will serve us well in the future regardless of macro conditions: our cost structure, our working capital and our capital spending.
First, on our cost structure. Cost reductions contributed $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter results, providing $0.40 in savings for the full year from our operational redesign program. We also announced in December a new global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce 2016 costs by $700 million versus 2015 or $900 million on a run rate basis. We have since identified an additional $100 million savings, bringing our run rate total to $1 billion and increasing our 2016 savings to about $730 million. This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision making and connect even more closely to our end markets. It will sharpen our focus by giving the businesses more control over their P&Ls and more agility to pursue growth. When we complete our cost savings program, our SG&A will reduce by about 15% on a run rate basis in 2016. Within that number, we are reducing our corporate costs by $200 million. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percentage of sales will reduce to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
I want to emphasize that this program is a DuPont initiative, completely separate from the proposed merger with Dow. We took a clean slate approach to building the right organization for the future. The changes we are making would have occurred regardless of the planned merger. The changes will make our businesses leaner, stronger competitors in every market where we do business. Importantly, these efforts are bringing even greater discipline and rigor to the investments we continue to make in the businesses to maintain our competitive advantage and better connect our science to the marketplace. The long-term success of our businesses will be driven by innovation and strong return on R&D investments.
Our pipeline continues to deliver. Over the past quarter in Agriculture, we successfully launched Leptra corn hybrids for the safrinha season. Production plants for Leptra are on track for one of the fastest technology ramp-ups in Pioneer history in the summer season. Our 2 newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and are expected to comprise over half of our North American corn sales volume in 2016. Qrome corn products continue to progress well towards commercialization. We will expand testing this coming summer in our IMPACT trials as we wait final import approvals in key markets.
Another example of where R&D is driving productive innovation is in Nutrition & Health. In the quarter, we saw volume growth in high-value products, including probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Demand for probiotics, primarily in the U.S., has been provided by our HOWARU products, which promote respiratory health in children. Demand for cultures has been driven by YO-MIX, which facilitates sugar reduction and delivers mouth feel and texture in yogurt.
Next on our list of critical initiatives is working capital. Each of our businesses had set individual goals for improvement in working capital for 2016 from a bottoms-up approach. We also launched the company-wide project of working capital to look at it from the top-down perspective. We are benchmarking our performance in payables, receivables and inventory against industry leaders and believe the opportunity for improvement is significant, as much as $1 billion in the medium term.
Our third area of focus is capital allocation. Our capital spending is guided by long-term goals, and that principle will not change. After looking hard at every project and its expected returns, we approved 2016 capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. That is down from about $1.4 billion in '15 and $1.5 billion in previous years, excluding Chemours. Our 2016 plan is more in line with our depreciation and amortization.
In summary, all of these activities demonstrate our focus on strengthening DuPont while creating sustainable shareholder value.
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Operating earnings per share of $0.27 were largely in line with our expectations. While we continued our disciplined focus on cost reductions and productivity, our results, again, were significantly impacted by currency, challenges in Ag markets, particularly in Brazil, and the continued weakness in emerging markets.
Segment results declined $0.23 per share in the quarter, including a $0.17 per share negative impact from currency, primarily the Brazilian real.
Full year operating earnings per share were $2.77 versus $3.36 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.71 per share. Excluding the currency impact for the full year, operating EPS would have increased by 4%.
Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.3 billion declined 1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by an additional 8 percentage points. The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real.
Turning now to Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to the segment results. Segment results, excluding currency, were down $0.06 per share year-over-year as growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications.
Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were a $0.04 headwind in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. A continued shift to a higher percentage of our earnings in the U.S. and Canada versus prior year resulted in this higher tax rate.
While changes in corporate expense did not impact quarterly results, I would like to highlight that for the full year, decreases in corporate expenses contributed $0.09 to earnings, reflecting our focus on cost reductions and productivity.
Slide 4 illustrates our geographic footprints in the fourth quarter. Our sales in the U.S. and Canada continued to grow as a percentage of total sales, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in the remaining segments. Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 25% on cost reductions and continued productivity. Operating margins improved by 450 basis points. Volume growth in enzymes, particularly in food and home and personal care, was offset by some declines in biomaterials.
Nutrition & Health improvement was led by cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems, which more than offset the negative currency impact. Operating margins in this segment improved by 110 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters.
In Agriculture, an operating loss of $54 million resulted in $188 million of lower operating earnings. Increases in local price, cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by $139 million negative currency impact. Prior year results benefited from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and a $36 million gain from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million.
Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in global automotive markets was more than offset by lower ethylene price and volume, along with currency. Average ethylene spot prices are down over 60% year-over-year and continued to significantly impact both top line and bottom line segment results.
Fourth quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand in currency. Demand from the oil and gas industry in the military segment remained soft, which impacted sales in Nomex thermal-resistant fiber as well as Kevlar high-strength materials and our Sustainable Solutions offerings.
Electronics & Communications operating results decreased $5 million as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under Events and Presentations. I encourage you to refer to these slides for further details on the segment results, including our expectations for the first quarter and full year 2016.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Let me start by explaining that our cash flow analysis includes Chemours for both 2015 and 2014. As you can see on the slide, our free cash flow decreased by about $1 billion from the prior year. About $650 million of the decline related to the Chemours transaction. The remainder was due to lower cash earnings from ongoing businesses year-over-year. As Ed indicated, we're very focused on our cost structure, working capital discipline and capital spending, and our plans to address these areas as part of our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program should improve our free cash flow in 2016.
We ended 2015 with a net debt of $2.6 billion versus $3.6 billion in 2014. The change from prior year is due to a decrease in gross debt year-over-year as a result of debt maturing during the year. Year-end cash balances were about $6 billion.
In the quarter, we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. Under the program, we received and retired about 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share.
Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about 900 million and about 882 million for the fourth quarter. For 2016, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 875 million shares, primarily reflecting the benefit of the 2015 share repurchases and the share repurchases scheduled in the second half of 2016.
On Slide 7, our operational redesign program delivered $0.10 of savings in the quarter and $0.40 of cost savings for the full year 2015. This resulted in operating margin improvements in 5 out of our 6 segments for the full year.
As we move into 2016, we will continue to aggressively focus on cost reduction in accordance with the plan we announced in December. As Ed mentioned, we have identified an additional $100 million of cost reductions, increasing our total run rate savings to $1 billion, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in '16 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which will be weighted towards the second half of 2016 as we implement specific actions in the first and second quarters.
Of the $1 billion in run rate savings, about 3/4 will come from SG&A. Included in these reductions is a decrease of about $200 million in corporate expense. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percent of sales will improve to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2016. These assumptions form the foundation for our 2016 guidance. As we saw in 2015, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a headwind for us again in 2016. We expect global growth of about 2% on an overall slowdown in global trade, driven by weaknesses in emerging markets and, in particular, uncertainty in China. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2016. Europe continues to gradually improve and expand manufacturing, while the U.S. will be challenged due to tepid global demand and a stronger dollar. China slowing, and uncertainty remains a concern as we continue to see a shift from industrial production to services and consumer sectors. In Agriculture, the fundamentals remain challenging as net farmer income continues to decline. Auto growth is expected to continue with 3% growth year-over-year.
With this backdrop, let's turn now to Slide 9. We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales, excluding currency. Our guidance reflects a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The estimate also includes headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share of currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and $0.05 to $0.10 per share from a higher base tax rate, reflecting our expectations of the geographic mix of earnings.
We continue to see slowing growth in emerging markets with us shifting our earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further weakening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Given the seasonality of our operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere, we anticipate approximately 2/3 of the expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016. Excluding currency, we would expect earnings growth of 17% to 23%, including the full year benefit of cost savings and share repurchases.
For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 23%, an increase from prior year due to the geographic mix of earnings. This represents, as I mentioned, $0.05 to $0.10 headwind in the outlook.
Benefits from a lower share count will be partially offset by higher interest cost in 2016. Interest expense will increase as a result of our reduced commercial paper market capacity.
Capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.1 billion. Excluding Chemours, this represents about a $300 million decline year-over-year and reflects our commitment to improving our capital allocation process as we scrutinize returns on a project-by-project basis.
In 2016, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings nonoperating pension and OPEB costs as well as costs associated with the planned merger of equals.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Ed."

It's simple, we have 3. One, delivering growth in operating earnings. An important driver here is delivering the $1 billion in run rate cost savings and the organizational efficiencies that come with the restructuring. Equally important, we are placing a lot of emphasis on keeping the business steady and on track. Our people are very focused on connecting even more closely with customers to deliver the value-added solutions they expect from DuPont. Two is driving improved capital allocation and working capital performance to generate more cash and to enhance our returns. Three, closing the merger, planning for synergies and preparing for the intended separations.
Let me now say a few words about the merger of equals with Dow, which we announced in December and which will be named DowDuPont. As we said at the time, we intend to combine 2 complementary portfolios to create 3 strong, highly focused, independent businesses, well-equipped to deliver growth and long-term sustainable value. Each business would target attractive markets where our combined science, technology and operational expertise will drive value for our stakeholders. We are focused on completing the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. We've identified the priority work streams and established our teams. We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. We are also focused on the preparation of the merged co-registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC. The initial filing will be made after each of DuPont and Dow file their annual reports with the Commission in February.
In December, we said that we expect the combined company to realize $3 billion in cost synergies. Each company has chartered a dozen formal business and functional integration and synergy planning teams to develop detailed, execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the companies post merger and capture our anticipated costs and growth synergies. The functional teams include legal, sourcing, logistics, supply chain, HR, finance, IT, facilities, among others. All of these teams are focused on planning for seamless business operations on day 1 after the merger and quickly capturing our planned synergies. These teams are chartered to ensure we plan to leverage the most effective operating models, channels to market and industry-best practices upon the creation of DowDuPont.
Just a few examples of the planning work the teams are doing include reviewing our warehouse and facilities footprint, evaluating IT platforms for savings and developing integration plans for our transactional processes.
As announced, we intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont into 3 separate public companies after our merger is complete: an agriculture company, a material science company and a specialty products company. We are doing all that we can now to expedite the timing of the spins, including beginning work on the carve-out financial statements for the separate companies.
In conclusion, 2016 is a pivotal and transformational year for DuPont as we accelerate our value creation work, invest in our core franchises and position our businesses for competitive future. We will give you regular updates on our progress.

I mean, I'm a believer that they occur every year in a few percent range as you keep streamlining your company. I would say -- so you're never done with it. I think where there was more cost evenings, David, in DuPont was when we could get up on a new IT platform because that would really streamline some of our G&A back office. Unfortunately, we're not -- we're on a very fragmented IT system. One of the benefits it looks like we obviously get here with the Dow merger is Dow is on the IT platform that we were going to the global, I'd say, latest revision of the SAP platform. And so between the work we did here on that platform and the work -- they, obviously, are already up on that platform, that's where -- let me just use the Ag company as an example. Their Ag business is on the platform. If we can translate ourselves onto that platform, that's where there would be cost savings. So I guess to back that up, if DuPont would have stayed on its own course over the next couple of years getting that platform up and running, that's where more costs would have come out of the company mostly in the G&A area. But we'll get that benefit quicker in the merger if we can merge onto that platform. The teams have already met on that a couple of times. I actually sat in one of those meetings, actually, up in Midland at the Dow corporate office with the teams, and we're feeling very bullish about that prospect to lean onto that platform."

We're limited right now on our ability to enter the market because of the transaction that's going on, and we will have that limitation probably through the proxy vote. But then after that, we'll be looking to enter the marketplace on that. So when you add all that up, you're right, there is a higher cash drain versus the operating income, but we're also looking at driving some working capital improvements. This is an area that we have focus on. We had some improvements, slight improvement in our working capital turns this year. But what we're looking at, attacking all 3 areas: receivables, inventory, payables.

But about half of our R&D in the company is in Ag. And by the reductions that we have done, just to put that in perspective, takes our R&D to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. And I think we are very selective in how we did it. And one of the things, probably if you look back historically, just to put this in perspective because I know there's been a lot said and talked about it, but through the last 15 years, the R&D has averaged in DuPont $1.65 billion, and that's a run rate over 15 years. And actually, from 2000 to 2010, it was $200 million lower than that. And then there was a little bit of a ramp-up to bring that average up to the $1.65 billion, and that's exactly about where we're going to be as we move forward through 2016 and on. So we are in a very heavy robust level. We're still one of the highest R&D companies in the world. And it's not off of our run rate that the company has run after many, many years.

Overall, from a corporate perspective, we spend about 75% of our R&D in Agriculture on seed and the balance of that in crop protection. In the seed business, about 40% of that or so would be on breeding and product testing and advancing the new genetics through to commercialization. Another 40% is on things like enabling technologies that allow us to produce seed more efficiently, characterization, trade integration, things like seed production technology. And then the balance of that, actually, at a much smaller portion, would be focused on discovery -- on trade discovery and development. And we've been ramping up our efforts in areas around insect control in corn, key agronomic trades like drought and nitrogen and then continuing to work on our own programs around soybeans like control as well as soy output trades, things like our Plenish brand that we have out there in the marketplace."

That's after 1 month because you rolled these numbers out 1 month ago. And you also rolled out -- you and Andrew rolled out a $3 billion number a month ago in terms of synergies for the combined entities. If I extract the way how you're upsizing here, I come out to $6 billion by September. Obviously, that's not right.

And on our $1 billion, we're moving, obviously, as rapidly as we can. I want to get that out of the way and have things settled down for the company and all that. So we're moving as fast as we can, and we did identify more, and so we're moving on that. The interesting thing on the $3 billion of the synergies with Dow, we have broken that out by all those key buckets we mentioned in our prepared remarks. The teams are meeting. As my comment was, I -- one of our big opportunities is this IT platform, that's why I got personally involved in it because if we can overlay onto that, there's a huge opportunity. But if you look back at our charts, there's $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in Ag that is very identified at this point in time. And there's so much overlap in the supply chain, the manufacturing chain, the sales chain. And by the way, the percentages we're talking about on the Ag side are very similar to other transactions, the similar-type companies there. And then we're in good shape, looking at the synergies on the specialty company. A lot of that comes from the combination of the electronics businesses from Dow and DuPont coming together and the synergies. Then we have on the material side, or identified, but where we're still working and we have a lot of opportunity is the purchasing supply chain. As I mentioned, the IT. And then we have a great opportunity to look at more shared services across the whole platform. And that's where -- hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could come from there. So it's the combination of all that. Now we're doing a lot of heavy lifting. And so for instance, in the supply chain area, between the 2 companies, just to give you -- we have hundreds of warehouses around the world, and we don't need that when we come together. So that is work you can't do in 1 week. That's going to take us the next 3 to 4 months literally identifying every single one and go where can we merge and converge together. So a little bit more heavy lifting on that supply chain purchasing, IT side. And then the shared services model, we want to move to more for a lot of the back-office work, which will reduce our G&A. So I really plan and we're really pushing with the teams that we are totally identifying on the $3 billion minimum by the time we get to close the merger so we can move immediately on it. And I would also say to you, I would be very hopeful that the $3 billion is our floor number and not the ceiling number. And If we can get more out of that, obviously, we're going to just move on it."

And you know from the past, as they start to make purchasing decisions, though, the locking in land and they'll secure their seed and they'll make sure they got the fertility programs right and then sort of back into what their crop protection regime is going to be. On top of that, for our own business, we're missing some volumes associated with the LaPorte incident. So that can evolve as to that picture. So overall, strong competitive market. I think on the offset there, we've got a strong crop protection pipeline that continues to come forward. We're now into the full-blown launch of Cyazypyr. We'll expect to see some recovery in Rynaxypyr volumes, especially in places like Asia-Pacific, in vegetables. Our new fungicide, Zorvec, early days but starting to get some traction on that, and our new insecticide, Pyraxalt. So those are a couple of areas that would offset some of that in the downside.

We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update",756,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update on our planned merger with Dow.
The quarter came in largely as expected amid continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, including currency pressures. The progress we are making on the 3 critical initiatives I outlined last quarter contributed to the quarter and will serve us well in the future regardless of macro conditions: our cost structure, our working capital and our capital spending.
First, on our cost structure. Cost reductions contributed $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter results, providing $0.40 in savings for the full year from our operational redesign program. We also announced in December a new global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce 2016 costs by $700 million versus 2015 or $900 million on a run rate basis. We have since identified an additional $100 million in savings, bringing our run rate total to $1 billion and increasing our 2016 savings to about $730 million. This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision making and connect even more closely to our end markets. It will sharpen our focus by giving the businesses more control over their P&Ls and more agility to pursue growth. When we complete our cost savings program, our SG&A will reduce by about 15% on a run rate basis in 2016. Within that number, we are reducing our corporate costs by $200 million. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percentage of sales will reduce to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
I want to emphasize that this program is a DuPont initiative, completely separate from the proposed merger with Dow. We took a clean slate approach to building the right organization for the future. The changes we are making would have occurred regardless of the planned merger. The changes will make our businesses leaner, stronger competitors in every market where we do business. Importantly, these efforts are bringing even greater discipline and rigor to the investments we continue to make in the businesses to maintain our competitive advantage and better connect our science to the marketplace. The long-term success of our businesses will be driven by innovation and strong return on R&D investments.
Our pipeline continues to deliver. Over the past quarter in Agriculture, we successfully launched Leptra corn hybrids for the safrinha season. Production plans for Leptra are on track for one of the fastest technology ramp-ups in Pioneer history in the summer season. Our 2 newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and are expected to comprise over half of our North American corn sales volume in 2016. Qrome corn products continue to progress well towards commercialization. We will expand testing this coming summer in our IMPACT trials as we wait final import approvals in key markets.
Another example of where R&D is driving productive innovation is in Nutrition & Health. In the quarter, we saw volume growth in high-value products, including probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Demand for probiotics, primarily in the U.S., has been provided by our HOWARU products, which promote respiratory health in children. Demand for cultures has been driven by YO-MIX, which facilitates sugar reduction and delivers mouth feel and texture in yogurt.
Next on our list of critical initiatives is working capital. Each of our businesses had set individual goals for improvement in working capital for 2016 from a bottoms-up approach. We also launched the company-wide project of working capital to look at it from the top-down perspective. We are benchmarking our performance in payables, receivables and inventory against industry leaders and believe the opportunity for improvement is significant, as much as $1 billion in the medium term.
Our third area of focus is capital allocation. Our capital spending is guided by long-term goals, and that principle will not change. After looking hard at every project and its expected returns, we approved 2016 capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. That is down from about $1.4 billion in '15 and $1.5 billion in previous years, excluding Chemours. Our 2016 plan is more in line with our depreciation and amortization.
In summary, all of these activities demonstrate our focus on strengthening DuPont while creating sustainable shareholder value.
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Full year operating earnings per share were $2.77 versus $3.36 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.71 per share. Excluding the currency impact for the full year, operating EPS would have increased by 4%.
Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.3 billion declined 1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by an additional 8 percentage points. The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real.
Turning now to Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to the segment results. Segment results, excluding currency, were down $0.06 per share year-over-year as growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications.
Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were a $0.04 headwind in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. A continued shift to a higher percentage of our earnings in the U.S. and Canada versus prior year resulted in this higher tax rate.
While changes in corporate expense did not impact quarterly results, I would like to highlight that for the full year, decreases in corporate expenses contributed $0.09 to earnings, reflecting our focus on cost reductions and productivity.
Slide 4 illustrates our geographic footprint in the fourth quarter. Our sales in the U.S. and Canada continued to grow as a percentage of total sales, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in the remaining segments. Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 25% on cost reductions and continued productivity. Operating margins improved by 450 basis points. Volume growth in enzymes, particularly in food and home and personal care, was offset by some declines in biomaterials.
Nutrition & Health improvement was led by cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems, which more than offset the negative currency impact. Operating margins in this segment improved by 110 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters.
In Agriculture, an operating loss of $54 million resulted in $188 million of lower operating earnings. Increases in local price, cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by $139 million negative currency impact. Prior year results benefited from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and a $36 million gain from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million.
Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in global automotive markets was more than offset by lower ethylene price and volume, along with currency. Average ethylene spot prices are down over 60% year-over-year and continued to significantly impact both top line and bottom line segment results.
Fourth quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand in currency. Demand from the oil and gas industry in the military segment remained soft, which impacted sales in Nomex thermal-resistant fiber as well as Kevlar high-strength materials and our Sustainable Solutions offerings.
Electronics & Communications operating results decreased $5 million as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under Events and Presentations. I encourage you to refer to these slides for further details on the segment results, including our expectations for the first quarter and full year 2016.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Let me start by explaining that our cash flow analysis includes Chemours for both 2015 and 2014. As you can see on the slide, our free cash flow decreased by about $1 billion from the prior year. About $650 million of the decline related to the Chemours transaction. The remainder was due to lower cash earnings from ongoing businesses year-over-year. As Ed indicated, we're very focused on our cost structure, working capital discipline and capital spending, and our plans to address these areas as part of our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program should improve our free cash flow in 2016.
We ended 2015 with a net debt of $2.6 billion versus $3.6 billion in 2014. The change from prior year is due to a decrease in gross debt year-over-year as a result of debt maturing during the year. Year-end cash balances were about $6 billion.
In the quarter, we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. Under the program, we received and retired about 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share.
Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about 900 million and about 882 million for the fourth quarter. For 2016, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 875 million shares, primarily reflecting the benefit of the 2015 share repurchases and the share repurchases scheduled in the second half of 2016.
On Slide 7, our operational redesign program delivered $0.10 of savings in the quarter and $0.40 of cost savings for the full year 2015. This resulted in operating margin improvements in 5 out of our 6 segments for the full year.
As we move into 2016, we will continue to aggressively focus on cost reduction in accordance with the plan we announced in December. As Ed mentioned, we have identified an additional $100 million of cost reductions, increasing our total run rate savings to $1 billion, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in '16 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which will be weighted towards the second half of 2016 as we implement specific actions in the first and second quarters.
Of the $1 billion in run rate savings, about 3/4 will come from SG&A. Included in these reductions is a decrease of about $200 million in corporate expense. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percent of sales will improve to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2016. These assumptions form the foundation for our 2016 guidance. As we saw in 2015, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a headwind for us again in 2016. We expect global growth of about 2% on an overall slowdown in global trade, driven by weaknesses in emerging markets and, in particular, uncertainty in China. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2016. Europe continues to gradually improve and expand manufacturing, while the U.S. will be challenged due to tepid global demand and a stronger dollar. China slowing, and uncertainty remains a concern as we continue to see a shift from industrial production to services and consumer sectors. In Agriculture, the fundamentals remain challenging as net farm income continues to decline. Auto growth is expected to continue with 3% growth year-over-year.
With this backdrop, let's turn now to Slide 9. We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales, excluding currency. Our guidance reflects a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The estimate also includes headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share of currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and $0.05 to $0.10 per share from a higher base tax rate, reflecting our expectations of the geographic mix of earnings.
We continue to see slowing growth in emerging markets with us shifting our earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further weakening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Given the seasonality of our operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere, we anticipate approximately 2/3 of the expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016. Excluding currency, we would expect earnings growth of 17% to 23%, including the full year benefit of cost savings and share repurchases.
For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 23%, an increase from prior year due to the geographic mix of earnings. This represents, as I mentioned, $0.05 to $0.10 headwind in the outlook.
Benefits from a lower share count will be partially offset by higher interest cost in 2016. Interest expense will increase as a result of our reduced commercial paper market capacity.
Capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.1 billion. Excluding Chemours, this represents about a $300 million decline year-over-year and reflects our commitment to improving our capital allocation process as we scrutinize returns on a project-by-project basis.
In 2016, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings nonoperating pension and OPEB costs as well as costs associated with the planned merger of equals.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Ed."

It's simple, we have 3. One, delivering growth in operating earnings. An important driver here is delivering the $1 billion in run rate cost savings and the organizational efficiencies that come with the restructuring. Equally important, we are placing a lot of emphasis on keeping the business steady and on track. Our people are very focused on connecting even more closely with customers to deliver the value-added solutions they expect from DuPont. Two is driving improved capital allocation and working capital performance to generate more cash and to enhance our returns. Three, closing the merger, planning for synergies and preparing for the intended separations.
Let me now say a few words about the merger of equals with Dow, which we announced in December and which will be named DowDuPont. As we said at the time, we intend to combine 2 complementary portfolios to create 3 strong, highly focused, independent businesses, well-equipped to deliver growth and long-term sustainable value. Each business would target attractive markets where our combined science, technology and operational expertise will drive value for our stakeholders. We are focused on completing the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. We've identified the priority work streams and established our teams. We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. We are also focused on the preparation of the merged co-registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC. The initial filing will be made after each of DuPont and Dow file their annual reports with the Commission in February.
In December, we said that we expect the combined company to realize $3 billion in cost synergies. Each company has chartered a dozen formal business and functional integration and synergy planning teams to develop detailed, execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the companies post merger and capture our anticipated costs and growth synergies. The functional teams include legal, sourcing, logistics, supply chain, HR, finance, IT, facilities, among others. All of these teams are focused on planning for seamless business operations on day 1 after the merger and quickly capturing our planned synergies. These teams are chartered to ensure we plan to leverage the most effective operating models, channels to market and industry-best practices upon the creation of DowDuPont.
Just a few examples of the planning work the teams are doing include reviewing our warehouse and facilities footprint, evaluating IT platforms for savings and developing integration plans for our transactional processes.
As announced, we intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont into 3 separate public companies after our merger is complete: an agriculture company, a material science company and a specialty products company. We are doing all that we can now to expedite the timing of the spins, including beginning work on the carve-out financial statements for the separate companies.
In conclusion, 2016 is a pivotal and transformational year for DuPont as we accelerate our value creation work, invest in our core franchises and position our businesses for competitive future. We will give you regular updates on our progress.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Greg."

I mean, I'm a believer that they occur every year in a few percent range as you keep streamlining your company. I would say -- so you're never done with it. I think where there was more cost evenings, David, in DuPont was when we could get up on a new IT platform because that would really streamline some of our G&A back office. Unfortunately, we're not -- we're on a very fragmented IT system. One of the benefits it looks like we obviously get here with the Dow merger is Dow is on the IT platform that we were going to the global, I'd say, latest revision of the SAP platform. And so between the work we did here on that platform and the work -- they, obviously, are already up on that platform, that's where -- let me just use the Ag company as an example. Their Ag business is on the platform. If we can translate ourselves onto that platform, that's where there would be cost savings. So I guess to back that up, if DuPont would have stayed on its own course over the next couple of years getting that platform up and running, that's where more costs would have come out of the company mostly in the G&A area. But we'll get that benefit quicker in the merger if we can merge onto that platform. The teams have already met on that a couple of times. I actually sat in one of those meetings, actually, up in Midland at the Dow corporate office with the teams, and we're feeling very bullish about that prospect to lean onto that platform."

And then as we start to think about that 2016 full summer season, this will be one of the fastest ramp-ups of a new trade in our portfolio. So we'll have so much more significant volumes of that going forward. In soybeans, it's a little too early to comment on final share. Clearly, we did face some competitive pressure in Brazil based on the adoption of the insect-protected soybean varieties that were out there. And we're collaborating with our Crop Protection colleagues in the use of seed treatments to offset some of that. And so we'll have to be back to you later as the season unfolds to really range just how that unfolded."

And one of the things, by the way if you look back historically, just to put this in perspective because I know there's been a lot said and talked about it, but through the last 15 years, the R&D has averaged in DuPont $1.65 billion, and that's a run rate over 15 years. And actually, from 2000 to 2010, it was $200 million lower than that. And then there was a little bit of a ramp-up to bring that average up to the $1.65 billion, and that's exactly about where we're going to be as we move forward through 2016 and on.

Overall, from a corporate perspective, we spend about 75% of our R&D in Agriculture on seed and the balance of that in crop protection. In the seed business, about 40% of that or so would be on breeding and product testing and advancing the new genetics through to commercialization. Another 40% is on things like enabling technologies that allow us to produce seed more efficiently, characterization, trade integration, things like seed production technology. And then the balance of that, actually, at a much smaller portion, would be focused on discovery -- on trade discovery and development.

And on our $1 billion, we're moving, obviously, as rapidly as we can. I want to get that out of the way and have things settled down for the company and all that. So we're moving as fast as we can, and we did identify more, and so we're moving on that. The interesting thing on the $3 billion of the synergies with Dow, we have broken that out by all those key buckets we mentioned in our prepared remarks. The teams are meeting. As my comment was, I -- one of our big opportunities is this IT platform, that's why I got personally involved in it because if we can overlay onto that, there's a huge opportunity. But if you look back at our charts, there's $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in Ag that is very identified at this point in time. And there's so much overlap in the supply chain, the manufacturing chain, the sales chain. And by the way, the percentages we're talking about on the Ag side are very similar to other transactions, the similar-type companies there. And then we're in good shape, looking at the synergies on the specialty company. A lot of that comes from the combination of the electronics businesses from Dow and DuPont coming together and the synergies. Then we have on the material side are identified, but where we're still working and we have a lot of opportunity is the purchasing supply chain. As I mentioned, the IT. And then we have a great opportunity to look at more shared services across the whole platform. And that's where -- hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could come from there. So it's the combination of all that. Now we're doing a lot of heavy lifting. And so for instance, in the supply chain area, between the 2 companies, just to give you -- we have hundreds of warehouses around the world, and we don't need that when we come together. So that is work you can't do in 1 week. That's going to take us the next 3 to 4 months literally identifying every single one and go where can we merge and converge together. So a little bit more heavy lifting on that supply chain purchasing, IT side. And then the shared services model, we want to move to more for a lot of the back-office work, which will reduce our G&A. So I really plan and we're really pushing with the teams that we are totally identifying on the $3 billion minimum by the time we get to close the merger so we can move immediately on it. And I would also say to you, I would be very hopeful that the $3 billion is our floor number and not the ceiling number. And If we can get more out of that, obviously, we're going to just move on it."

And you know from the past, as they start to make purchasing decisions, though, the locking in land and they'll secure their seed and they'll make sure they got the fertility programs right and then sort of back into what their crop protection regime is going to be. On top of that, for our own business, we're missing some volumes associated with the LaPorte incident. So that kind of all adds to that picture. So overall, strong competitive market. I think on the offset there, we've got a strong crop protection pipeline that continues to come forward. We're now into the full-blown launch of Cyazypyr. We'll expect to see some recovery in Rynaxypyr volumes, especially in places like Asia-Pacific, in fruits and vegetables. Our new fungicide, Zorvec, early days but starting to get some traction on that, and our new insecticide, Pyraxalt. So those are a couple of areas that would offset some of that in the downside.

We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update",756,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I'd like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers. Then I'll come back and provide an update on our planned merger with Dow.
The quarter came in largely as expected amid continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, including currency pressures. The progress we are making on the 3 critical initiatives I outlined last quarter contributed to the quarter and will serve us well in the future regardless of macro conditions: our cost structure, our working capital and our capital spending.
First, on our cost structure. Cost reductions contributed $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter results, providing $0.40 in savings for the full year from our operational redesign program. We also announced in December a new global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce 2016 costs by $700 million versus 2015 or $900 million on a run rate basis. We have since identified an additional $100 million in savings, bringing our run rate total to $1 billion and increasing our 2016 savings to about $730 million. This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision making and connect even more closely to our end markets. It will sharpen our focus by giving the businesses more control over their P&Ls and more agility to pursue growth. When we complete our cost savings program, our SG&A will reduce by about 15% on a run rate basis in 2016. Within that number, we are reducing our corporate costs by $200 million. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percentage of sales will reduce to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
I want to emphasize that this program is a DuPont initiative, completely separate from the proposed merger with Dow. We took a clean slate approach to building the right organization for the future. The changes we are making would have occurred regardless of the planned merger. The changes will make our businesses leaner, stronger competitors in every market where we do business. Importantly, these efforts are bringing even greater discipline and rigor to the investments we continue to make in the businesses to maintain our competitive advantage and better connect our science to the marketplace. The long-term success of our businesses will be driven by innovation and strong return on R&D investments.
Our pipeline continues to deliver. Over the past quarter in Agriculture, we successfully launched Leptra corn hybrids for the safrinha season. Production plans for Leptra are on track for one of the fastest technology ramp-ups in Pioneer history in the summer season. Our 2 newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and are expected to comprise over half of our North American corn sales volume in 2016. Qrome corn products continue to progress well towards commercialization. We will expand testing this coming summer in our IMPACT trials as we wait final import approvals in key markets.
Another example of where R&D is driving productive innovation is in Nutrition & Health. In the quarter, we saw volume growth in high-value products, including probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Demand for probiotics, primarily in the U.S., has been provided by our HOWARU products, which promote respiratory health in children. Demand for cultures has been driven by YO-MIX, which facilitates sugar reduction and delivers mouth feel and texture in yogurt.
Next on our list of critical initiatives is working capital. Each of our businesses had set individual goals for improvement in working capital for 2016 from a bottoms-up approach. We also launched the company-wide project of working capital to look at it from the top-down perspective. We are benchmarking our performance in payables, receivables and inventory against industry leaders and believe the opportunity for improvement is significant, as much as $1 billion in the medium term.
Our third area of focus is capital allocation. Our capital spending is guided by long-term goals, and that principle will not change. After looking hard at every project and its expected returns, we approved 2016 capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. That is down from about $1.4 billion in '15 and $1.5 billion in previous years, excluding Chemours. Our 2016 plan is more in line with our depreciation and amortization.
In summary, all of these activities demonstrate our focus on strengthening DuPont while creating sustainable shareholder value.
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Operating earnings per share of $0.27 were largely in line with our expectations. While we continued our disciplined focus on cost reductions and productivity, our results, again, were significantly impacted by currency, challenges in Ag markets, particularly in Brazil, and the continued weakness in emerging markets.
Segment results declined $0.23 per share in the quarter, including a $0.17 per share negative impact from currency, primarily the Brazilian real.
Full year operating earnings per share were $2.77 versus $3.36 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.71 per share. Excluding the currency impact for the full year, operating EPS would have increased by 4%.
Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.3 billion declined 1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by an additional 8 percentage points. The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real.
Turning now to Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to the segment results. Segment results, excluding currency, were down $0.06 per share year-over-year as growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Safety & Protection and Electronics & Communications.
Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were a $0.04 headwind in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. A continued shift to a higher percentage of our earnings in the U.S. and Canada versus prior year resulted in this higher tax rate.
While changes in corporate expense did not impact quarterly results, I would like to highlight that for the full year, decreases in corporate expenses contributed $0.09 to earnings, reflecting our focus on cost reductions and productivity.
Slide 4 illustrates our geographic footprint in the fourth quarter. Our sales in the U.S. and Canada continued to grow as a percentage of total sales, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in the remaining segments. Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 25% on cost reductions and continued productivity. Operating margins improved by 450 basis points. Volume growth in enzymes, particularly in food and home and personal care, was offset by some declines in biomaterials.
Nutrition & Health improvement was led by cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems, which more than offset the negative currency impact. Operating margins in this segment improved by 110 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters.
In Agriculture, an operating loss of $54 million resulted in $188 million of lower operating earnings. Increases in local price, cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by $139 million negative currency impact. Prior year results benefited from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and a $36 million gain from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million.
Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in global automotive markets was more than offset by lower ethylene price and volume, along with currency. Average ethylene spot prices are down over 60% year-over-year and continued to significantly impact both top line and bottom line segment results.
Fourth quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand in currency. Demand from the oil and gas industry in the military segment remained soft, which impacted sales in Nomex thermal-resistant fiber as well as Kevlar high-strength materials and our Sustainable Solutions offerings.
Electronics & Communications operating results decreased $5 million as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under Events and Presentations. I encourage you to refer to these slides for further details on the segment results, including our expectations for the first quarter and full year 2016.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Let me start by explaining that our cash flow analysis includes Chemours for both 2015 and 2014. As you can see on the slide, our free cash flow decreased by about $1 billion from the prior year. About $650 million of the decline related to the Chemours transaction. The remainder was due to lower cash earnings from ongoing businesses year-over-year. As Ed indicated, we're very focused on our cost structure, working capital discipline and capital spending, and our plans to address these areas as part of our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program should improve our free cash flow in 2016.
We ended 2015 with a net debt of $2.6 billion versus $3.6 billion in 2014. The change from prior year is due to a decrease in gross debt year-over-year as a result of debt maturing during the year. Year-end cash balances were about $6 billion.
In the quarter, we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. Under the program, we received and retired about 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share.
Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about 900 million and about 882 million for the fourth quarter. For 2016, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 875 million shares, primarily reflecting the benefit of the 2015 share repurchases and the share repurchases scheduled in the second half of 2016.
On Slide 7, our operational redesign program delivered $0.10 of savings in the quarter and $0.40 of cost savings for the full year 2015. This resulted in operating margin improvements in 5 out of our 6 segments for the full year.
As we move into 2016, we will continue to aggressively focus on cost reduction in accordance with the plan we announced in December. As Ed mentioned, we have identified an additional $100 million of cost reductions, increasing our total run rate savings to $1 billion, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in '16 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which will be weighted towards the second half of 2016 as we implement specific actions in the first and second quarters.
Of the $1 billion in run rate savings, about 3/4 will come from SG&A. Included in these reductions is a decrease of about $200 million in corporate expense. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percent of sales will improve to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2016. These assumptions form the foundation for our 2016 guidance. As we saw in 2015, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a headwind for us again in 2016. We expect global growth of about 2% on an overall slowdown in global trade, driven by weaknesses in emerging markets and, in particular, uncertainty in China. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2016. Europe continues to gradually improve and expand manufacturing, while the U.S. will be challenged due to tepid global demand and a stronger dollar. China slowing, and uncertainty remains a concern as we continue to see a shift from industrial production to services and consumer sectors. In Agriculture, the fundamentals remain challenging as net farm income continues to decline. Auto growth is expected to continue with 3% growth year-over-year.
With this backdrop, let's turn now to Slide 9. We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales, excluding currency. Our guidance reflects a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The estimate also includes headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share of currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and $0.05 to $0.10 per share from a higher base tax rate, reflecting our expectations of the geographic mix of earnings.
We continue to see slowing growth in emerging markets with us shifting our earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further weakening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Given the seasonality of our operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere, we anticipate approximately 2/3 of the expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016. Excluding currency, we would expect earnings growth of 17% to 23%, including the full year benefit of cost savings and share repurchases.
For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 23%, an increase from prior year due to the geographic mix of earnings. This represents, as I mentioned, $0.05 to $0.10 headwind in the outlook.
Benefits from a lower share count will be partially offset by higher interest cost in 2016. Interest expense will increase as a result of our reduced commercial paper market capacity.
Capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.1 billion. Excluding Chemours, this represents about a $300 million decline year-over-year and reflects our commitment to improving our capital allocation process as we scrutinize returns on a project-by-project basis.
In 2016, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings nonoperating pension and OPEB costs as well as costs associated with the planned merger of equals.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Ed."

It's simple, we have 3. One, delivering growth in operating earnings. An important driver here is delivering the $1 billion in run rate cost savings and the organizational efficiencies that come with the restructuring. Equally important, we are placing a lot of emphasis on keeping the business steady and on track. Our people are very focused on connecting even more closely with customers to deliver the value-added solutions they expect from DuPont. Two is driving improved capital allocation and working capital performance to generate more cash and to enhance our returns. Three, closing the merger, planning for synergies and preparing for the intended separations.
Let me now say a few words about the merger of equals with Dow, which we announced in December and which will be named DowDuPont. As we said at the time, we intend to combine 2 complementary portfolios to create 3 strong, highly focused, independent businesses, well-equipped to deliver growth and long-term sustainable value. Each business would target attractive markets where our combined science, technology and operational expertise will drive value for our stakeholders. We are focused on completing the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. We've identified the priority work streams and established our teams. We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. We are also focused on the preparation of the merged co-registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC. The initial filing will be made after each of DuPont and Dow file their annual reports with the Commission in February.
In December, we said that we expect the combined company to realize $3 billion in cost synergies. Each company has chartered a dozen formal business and functional integration and synergy planning teams to develop detailed, execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the companies post merger and capture our anticipated costs and growth synergies. The functional teams include legal, sourcing, logistics, supply chain, HR, finance, IT, facilities, among others. All of these teams are focused on planning for seamless business operations on day 1 after the merger and quickly capturing our planned synergies. These teams are chartered to ensure we plan to leverage the most effective operating models, channels to market and industry-best practices upon the creation of DowDuPont.
Just a few examples of the planning work the teams are doing include reviewing our warehouse and facilities footprint, evaluating IT platforms for savings and developing integration plans for our transactional processes.
As announced, we intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont into 3 separate public companies after our merger is complete: an agriculture company, a material science company and a specialty products company. We are doing all that we can now to expedite the timing of the spins, including beginning work on the carve-out financial statements for the separate companies.
In conclusion, 2016 is a pivotal and transformational year for DuPont as we accelerate our value creation work, invest in our core franchises and position our businesses for competitive future. We will give you regular updates on our progress.

Unfortunately, we're not -- we're on a very fragmented IT system.

So I guess to back that up, if DuPont would have stayed on its own course over the next couple of years getting that platform up and running, that's where more costs would have come out of the company mostly in the G&A area. But we'll get that benefit quicker in the merger if we can merge onto that platform. The teams have already met on that a couple of times. I actually sat in one of those meetings, actually, up in Midland at the Dow corporate office with the teams, and we're feeling very bullish about that prospect to lean onto that platform."

We're limited right now on our ability to enter the market because of the transaction that's going on, and we will have that limitation probably through the proxy vote. But then after that, we'll be looking to enter the marketplace on that.

I would just suggest that you go back and check it out because Cam Newton was really amazing. And Ed I know you were busy this weekend also with Johnson-Tyco but also busy upsizing the cost reductions. 2016 goes from $700 million to $730 million, run rate $900 million to $1 billion. That's after 1 month because you rolled these numbers out 1 month ago. And you also rolled out -- you and Andrew rolled out a $3 billion number a month ago in terms of synergies for the combined entities. If I extrapolate how you're upsizing here, I come out to $6 billion by September. Obviously, that's not right. But how should we be thinking -- now that you're a month into the progress, you've got a couple of teams together working on these synergies, how should we think about the combined synergies of DowDuPont?"

And on our $1 billion, we're moving, obviously, as rapidly as we can. I want to get that out of the way and have things settled down for the company and all that. So we're moving as fast as we can, and we did identify more, and so we're moving on that. The interesting thing on the $3 billion of the synergies with Dow, we have broken that out by all those key buckets we mentioned in our prepared remarks. The teams are meeting. As my comment was, I -- one of our big opportunities is this IT platform, that's why I got personally involved in it because if we can overlay onto that, there's a huge opportunity. But if you look back at our charts, there's $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in Ag that is very identified at this point in time. And there's so much overlap in the supply chain, the manufacturing chain, the sales chain. And by the way, the percentages we're talking about on the Ag side are very similar to other transactions, the similar-type companies there. And then we're in good shape, looking at the synergies on the specialty company. A lot of that comes from the combination of the electronics businesses from Dow and DuPont coming together and the synergies. Then we have on the material side are identified, but where we're still working and we have a lot of opportunity is the purchasing supply chain. As I mentioned, the IT. And then we have a great opportunity to look at more shared services across the whole platform. And that's where -- hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could come from there. So it's the combination of all that. Now we're doing a lot of heavy lifting. And so for instance, in the supply chain area, between the 2 companies, just to give you -- we have hundreds of warehouses around the world, and we don't need that when we come together. So that is work you can't do in 1 week. That's going to take us the next 3 to 4 months literally identifying every single one and go where can we merge and converge together. So a little bit more heavy lifting on that supply chain purchasing, IT side. And then the shared services model, we want to move to more for a lot of the back-office work, which will reduce our G&A. So I really plan and we're really pushing with the teams that we are totally identifying on the $3 billion minimum by the time we get to close the merger so we can move immediately on it. And I would also say to you, I would be very hopeful that the $3 billion is our floor number and not the ceiling number. And if we can get more out of that, obviously, we're going to just move on it."

If we think about 2016, just the overall total macroeconomics, we're predicting net farm income and net farm prices for growers to be challenged. And you know from the past, as they start to make purchasing decisions, though, the locking in land and they'll secure their seed and they'll make sure they got the fertility programs right and then sort of back into what their crop protection regime is going to be. On top of that, for our own business, we're missing some volumes associated with the LaPorte incident. So that kind of all adds to that picture. So overall, strong competitive market. I think on the offset there, we've got a strong crop protection pipeline that continues to come forward. We're now into the full-blown launch of Cyazypyr. We'll expect to see some recovery in Rynaxypyr volumes, especially in places like Asia-Pacific, in fruits and vegetables. Our new fungicide, Zorvec, early days but starting to get some traction on that, and our new insecticide, Pyraxalt. So those are a couple of areas that would offset some of that in the downside. And Pyraxalt, we're really just getting some testing going on that. The full launch of Pyraxalt would be in 2017."

I would like to share my perspective on the first quarter, then I'll update you on our progress with our 3 critical initiatives as well as our planned merger equals with Dow. 
Overall, I was pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter. Despite continued challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we delivered operating earnings of $1.26 per share, even with the last year's quarter. Excluding $0.10 per share of negative currency, operating earnings rose 8%. Sales declined 2%, excluding currency, reflecting the current environment. The weakening U.S. dollar gave us some relief. 
I don't want to steal any thunder from Jim, but it's worth saying a couple of things about ag's first quarter. Much of the quarter's strength was due to Ag. Solid execution in Ag, our largest segment, enabled a strong start to the North American corn season. I'm also very pleased with our results in the safrinha season as we delivered strong volume growth. Nick and Jim will comment more on all that in a moment. 
Looking beyond Ag, as I mentioned, most of our other segment performed well. One worth calling out is Nutrition & Health where we had broad-based volume growth and significant operating margin expansion. 
Let me give you a couple examples of new products that contributed to our growth in N&H. First, Supro, our new best-in-class isolated soy protein for dry powdered beverages; and second, our new long-life greek yogurts in China. Probiotics increased sales 30% as our productivity efforts have freed up capacity to respond to strong customer demand. I was pleased to see operating margins expand in 4 of our 6 segments, including progress with our global cost savings and restructuring plan.  
In sum, most of our businesses exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We had a good start to the year, yet planting is just beginning in the northern hemisphere and at this point, it's too early to call the year for Ag. There are still a number of difficult macro variables and we want to see how those factors play out. 
Now let me give you an update on our progress with the 3 critical priorities I outlined when I became CEO. As a reminder, we said we were committed to shrinking our cost structure, improving our working capital performance and reducing our capital expenditures. We strongly believe we need to improve our performance in all 3 areas as we want to benchmark against best-in-class companies in all of our businesses. The encouraging part is the quality of the leadership team, including their desire to win, which has impressed me about DuPont from the start. 
The point of our Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan is to strengthen the competitiveness of our business, while reducing our cost by $1 billion on on a run-rate basis by year-end. Consistent with this target, we plan to show you a net year-over-year savings of $730 million for full year 2016. We made good progress with this objective in the first quarter. In fact, we are exiting the quarter down about $135 million in operating costs, mainly in SG&A. One area where we've taken significant action is corporate cost. Already, year-over-year, we are down 44% on an operating earnings basis. I applaud the teams for their hard work and getting us here. This quarter puts as well on our way towards a $200 million year-over-year reduction in corporate cost. Also our Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan is separate from, and incremental to, the cost synergies we expect to capture in connection with our planned merger of equals with Dow. The actions we have taken to abolish the matrix organizations have given our business full control of their P&Ls, enabling faster decision-making. The company is visibly moving at a faster clip. 
Turning to working capital. Earlier, we set goals for improvement by business for 2016. In the first quarter, we launched a company-wide project to improve working capital. We see opportunity and inventory, first and foremost, but also in payables and receivables. Our first quarter results reflect our focus on working capital and capital spending resulting in a $300 million improvement in free cash flow year-over-year, excluding Chemours. We continue to expect to deliver improvements in working capital over the medium term. That said, this year's working capital performance will reflect pressure from our cost-reduction programs, including severance payments, which are necessary to support our long-term objectives. Our capital spending in 2016 is expected to total $1.1 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. That's a decline of 21%. We spent about $360 million on CapEx in the first quarter, and we reviewed each and every dollar before we spent it with a closed eye on expected returns. Our first quarter CapEx spend is 14% below last year, again, excluding Chemours. 
As we work toward our planned merger with Dow and the intended separation into 3 highly focused independent businesses, I am pleased with the progress the teams are making. We achieved the number of milestones toward closing the merger in recent weeks. On March 1, we filed our initial form S-4 registration statement and recently filed the First Amendment. That process is proceeding along smoothly. The form S-4 will become effective after we complete the review process with the SEC, which we currently anticipate will be no later than the end of the second quarter. The special stockholders meeting for both company shareholders to vote on the merger will take place thereafter. 
We also have submitted key regulatory filings related to the merger in the major jurisdictions where we operate. We always expected a thorough review process, and we're working closely with regulators in all the relevant jurisdictions to complete that process. 
We continue to expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Integration plan is well underway. We have formed a joint integration management office. Dow and DuPont teams are working directly together on plans to execute the merger, capture synergies and prepare for the intended business separations. The team is working diligently to develop execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as independent business units as soon as possible after the merger closes. 
In coordination with the joint integration management office, each of the 3 businesses is working to identify and plan for the right operating structure for their specific needs. Another important point I'd like to make is our synergy target for the combined company remain on track. We have 27 teams focused on different categories of costs, and they are very clear about what the goal is. Our confidence in the targets we established in December has done nothing but go up. After diving into the details, we continue to believe there will be at least $3 billion in costs and $1 billion in gross synergies on a run-rate basis. We have benchmarked cost against industry peers alongside McKenzie [ph], and they have confirmed that the $3 billion is achievable. We continue to expect to capture $1.3 billion in Ag, $1.5 billion in Material Science and $300 million in Specialty Products cost synergies. 
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Solid execution in a tough macro environment, particularly on",1537,"Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the first quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of $1.26 per share were even with prior year and up 8% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro environment, particularly on cost savings and a strong start to the North American corn season in Ag positively impacted the quarter.  Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter declined 2%. Local pricing gains in Ag and Industrial Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in most of the remaining segments. Currency continued to negatively impact sales by an additional 4 percentage points in the quarter. 
I'd like to highlight where we're seeing some positives from a regional perspective, particularly in our developing markets, which represented about 30% of our first quarter sales. In the quarter, sales in developing markets were up 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Agriculture and Nutrition & Health in Europe and Asia-Pacific, principally China. Local pricing gains in Latin America and Europe were results of mixed enrichments and actions to offset currency, primarily within Agriculture. 
Turning to Slide 4. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to segment results. Segment results, when you exclude currency, were up $0.02 per share in the quarter on cost savings, local price and product mix gains in Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences, and volume growth in Nutrition & Health. Lower corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.05 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than the prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.05. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation, and we're seeing the full benefit of this program here. A decrease in net after-tax exchange losses contributed $0.02 to earnings in the quarter. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings. 
Let's turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Protection Solutions was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Nutrition & Health increased on a broad-based volume growth and cost savings, which more than offset the negative currency that they saw. Operating margins in this segment improved 240 basis points, and have grown year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected pricing gains on new product introductions in bioactives, increased demand for biomaterials and the absence of prior year one-time cost in Clean Technologies. Operating margins improved 250 basis points in the quarter for Industrial Biosciences. 
Protection Solutions operating earnings increased $9 million as lower costs and improved plant utilization at the Chambers Works facility were partially offset by lower volumes in the negative currency impact. Operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter here. 
In Electronics & Communications, operating earnings decreased $20 million as cost savings and increased demand for Tedlar film were more than offset by competitive pressures in Solamet paste, lower demand in consumer electronics and a $16 million litigation expense. 
I'd like to highlight that while volumes in Solamet paste were down year-over-year, we did see sequential volume growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, and we grew market share following the launch of our PV19B late last year. 
Agriculture operating earnings declined $37 million year-over-year as local price and product mix gains and cost savings were more than offset by an $83 million negative currency impact, lower volumes and about $40 million negative impact from LaPorte shutdown due to lost sales and inventory write-offs. Jim will provide further details on the first quarter performance with Agriculture later in the call. 
Performance Materials operating earnings declined $44 million as lower cost and increased demand in Asia-Pacific automotive markets were more than offset by lower demand for ethylene and ethylene-based products, lower local price and negative impact from currency. The price decline was driven by lower ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 50% year-over-year, and we saw a competitive pressure in commoditized products. 
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under Events and Presentations. I encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results, including our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.2 billion reflects Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow in the quarter. Our free cash flow improved by about $500 million year-over-year, with about $200 million of the improvement due to the absence of Chemours. The remainder of the improvement is due to lower working capital and CapEx in the first quarter. 
Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2015 balance, which reflects our nominal seasonal shifts. Primary uses of our cash in the quarter related to funding our seasonal Agriculture working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends. 
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our objective is to complete $2 billion in share repurchases in 2016. However, the planned merger of equals with Dow and the associated impact from SEC rules and regulations affects our trading windows. After the shareholder vote, we will evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and plan to make repurchases. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 per share from $2.95 to $3.10 previously announced. The estimated negative currency impact of the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.20 per share versus a previously communicated estimate of $0.30 per share. The U.S. dollar has weakened against most currencies since the estimate we provided in January. For the full year, we now expect our base tax rate to be about 24%, an increase from our prior estimate of 23% due to the geographic mix of earnings. This results in a $0.10 headwind from higher base tax rate in the outlook versus our prior year.  Our guidance continues to reflect a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. While the business outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, about half of this was due to a stronger-than-expected start to the season in Agriculture. The remainder was due to the underlying performance of the businesses, and that is what we're reflecting in our revised outlook for the full year. 
For the first half of 2016, we expect operating earnings to be even with prior year as the timing benefits, primarily within Agriculture from a stronger-than-expected start to North American corn season are anticipated to largely be offset in the second quarter. We continue to expect full year net sales to be down low single digits, percent-wise, versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in Agriculture. 
Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar is stronger than last year against most currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales are expected to be about even with prior year. 
We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 17% to 23%, when we take out currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. We remain cautious on our outlook for 2016 as market conditions continue to remain challenging. In Agriculture, the fundamentals have not changed since the outlook we provided in January. Net income is declining and seed and Crop Protection supply is abundant of inventories globally. Economists are currently forecasting lower global industrial production in key markets, including the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and China. China's economic slowdown continues, particularly with industrial, real estate and financial sectors impacting the Asia-Pacific region.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight where we stand on our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. As we previously communicated, we expect this plan will generate $1 billion on a run-rate basis, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in 2016 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which we weighted towards the second half of 2016. 
For the first quarter, our operating cost, which includes SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $135 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 7% decline in cost year-over-year. SG&A costs declined about $110 million or 9% versus last year on cost savings and currency benefits. Our corporate cost on an operating earnings basis decreased 44% year-over-year, and highlights that the actions we outlined in December are truly generating results. We are on track to deliver our 2016 commitment of a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses, improving to about a 1.3% as a percent of sales. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results in Agriculture."
268053,329372963,962546,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick.

Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected, with farmers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and Crop Protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we're not seeing anything significantly different in market conditions from what we shared with you earlier this year. But even in this difficult environment, we remain focused and are executing on the variables that are within our control. And I think our first quarter performance clearly illustrates that. 
Now I'm focused on 3 very clear priorities. First, delivering on our 2016 cost savings and operating earnings commitments. And our results for the quarter indicate we're firmly on track to do that. Secondly, I've been personally spending significant time reviewing our R&D programs with our research teams to ensure we're delivering on our exciting pipeline of new genetics, biotech traits and Crop Protection products on schedule. Lastly, from our announced merger with Dow, our teams are working with great urgency to create a world leading production Ag business, and we're developing detailed plans to capture the $1.3 billion of cost synergies. 
Even though this is challenging work, you can feel the excitement of the teams. 
In addition to these 3 priorities, I also spend my time minimizing distractions, ensuring our teams keep their focus on delivering results for our stakeholders during this exciting time of change. 
And as I mentioned, our results in the first quarter demonstrated strong execution in challenging market conditions. Results were better than we expected, primarily due to higher corn area in North America. Earlier timing of shipments to customers consistent with that strong start we had in the fourth quarter of 2015, and stronger sunflower sales in Europe based on the performance of our newest products. 
Currency, while still a significant headwind compared to last year, was also a little better than we anticipated.
What I'm proudest of is we were able to deliver 2% higher prices across the segment even in this highly competitive market environment. In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, and most importantly, in North America. In Crop Protection, we took decisive pricing actions to mitigate a stronger U.S. dollar in Latin America and Eastern Europe and, in fact, local pricing actions fully offset the impact of currency in Latin America. 
Now in addition to local pricing gains, corn seed volumes were higher than the prior year from sales in North America, consistent with the recent USDA results indicating higher expected corn acres this year and in Brazil's safrinha season. Our increases in corn and sunflower volume were more than offset by the lower insecticide sales in Latin America and in sales to other third parties. Additional offsets included the impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and from lower soybean volumes.  Now most of the decline in insecticide volumes can be tied to Brazil's low test pressure, high industry inventories and the impact of insect-protected soybean varieties. 
Now turning to our pipeline. As planned, we made our first sales of Zorvec fungicide for disease control in Korea, Australia and China in the first quarter. We expect Zorvec to be very competitive in the $2 billion market for life and mildew control, offering potato, grape and vegetable growers consistent, long-lasting control with a favorable environmental profile. We successfully launched Leptra insect protected corn hybrids in Brazil in the safrinha season, and initial indications of performance are good. Leptra's strong value proposition is also allowing us to recapture price in that market. Strong customer interest and an aggressive seed production plan have us well positioned to ramp up Leptra to as much is 1/3 of our volume in the upcoming summer season, and one of the fastest technology introductions in Pioneer's history. In North America, soybeans, we are currently introducing varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology in a very limited launch. While we didn't plan for large volumes, this will allow our sales reps and customers to test the performance of these soybeans as we prepare for our full launch in 2017, pending regulatory approvals. 
In addition to all of that, we had a really exciting announcement this past week. We announced our intention to commercialize our first corn hybrids developed through the application of CRISPR-Cas advanced breeding technology within the next 5 years. While this is the first step, our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation for success for future products developed with this important innovation in plant breeding. 
We now anticipate results for the full year to be a little stronger than what we shared with you in January, primarily due to the recent weakening of the dollar against many global currencies, including their the real, and from higher corn planted acre. Now this will partially be offset by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter seed sales to first quarter 2017. This is a result of the enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market approach in the southern U.S., similar to the advantage approach we take in the Midwest. Additionally, we'll have some unplanned costs as a result of our recent decision regarding the LaPorte insecticide unit from the write-off and disposal in process inventory and to dismantle the facility. 
We had a good start to the year. We have a lot going on in Agriculture, and I'm very excited about the progress. I'm confident the team is focused on delivering on our commitments, preparing for the merger and advancing our pipeline. 
Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

As we said back in January, we just weren't seeing much change in the conditions in the marketplace from where we launched back in August or September. So we've had our pricing cards out there for a number of months. So when I look at pricing, I think of it -- in that area, i think of it in 3 specific ways. First is card price, and that's that year-over-year same technology, same market card pricing. And as we said back in January, our card pricing is generally flat year-over-year. The second impact in our numbers then would be due to mix. And we're seeing strong demand in our order book for our newest technology. About 50% of our lineup in North America is from genetics that we put in the market in the last 2 years. So as growers have a chance to look at that 2 consecutive years in our yield trials, they really jumped on that. So we're seeing a nice lift in overall mix. And then last would be in the discounting area. And so these discounts come in a number of different areas, where there it's early buy discounts or cash discounts. And yet overall, I would say, we're seeing maybe a slightly elevated level of discount, but nothing really out of the ordinary that you might expect. Folks took advantage of some of the programs that we had out there. I would also remind you that our direct sales model in North America gives us great visibility of our products and our pricing, especially at that net price level. So we see almost a realtime basis purchases and what's going there. So I think overall, with this speaks to is a strong focus by our organization and an execution intensity really driving the plan that we put out there back in August and September."

So we have a big opportunity there. Mostly, the biggest piece in inventory, so we're very, very focused there. And we are going to have some headwind this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks because of the severance cost and all that. So again, that's the benefit of the company going forward. But this won't happen just this year, but we clearly will have traction this year. I think you just saw in the first quarter, we have a slight improvement already in working capital and generated additional $300 million of free cash flow this year over last year, also because CapEx was lower by 14% year-over-year. So we're starting to get really good focus. Nick and I had operating reviews with every business over the last week in working capital's a big part of the conversation with the teams.

We're feeling the impact of insect protected varieties of soybeans that are in that market. And overall, I'd say channel inventories there are still pretty elevated based on the 2 years. In our insecticide business as well as in Crop Protection, we're feeling the impact of the LaPorte shutdown that we had. Most of that is related to [indiscernible]. We essentially replaced all of the methanol that we have been selling in previous years now through third parties, but it's just been really tough to find good quality sources of the mill. So you're seeing some of that year-over-year. As we get into the second half of the year, we continue to drive the launches of Cyazypyr around the world. If I separate Brazil, Rynaxypyr sales growth has grown volumes every year since its launch, and we'll expect to see good inroads. And I would say, our Crop Protection business in North America started off pretty strong here this year. Looking at the on-the-ground sales versus our out-the-door business, we feel really good about our penetration there. It's still early in the season to talk about full year. We still have a lot ago. And when you think about corn share now, again, little early to call share. I agree with you, now doubt we're seeing volume increases in North America consistent with that USDA report on the 94 essentially million acres. We're seeing volume growth based on our new technology. And our teams are going to stay really focused. But it's way too early to talk about seed share. As of today, we're about 30% planted in North America. That is elevated. Normally, we'll be about 15% for this time of the year.

So if we have a minus 2 in the first quarter, just some slight improvement kind of in the second half of the year. And then it really depends by business. As you look out what it's going to be Nutrition & Health obviously good, we're seeing really broad-based growth there. And by the way, the probiotics area is really hot, like 30% growth, and we're actually getting more products out the door, more efficiency in our facility. So that's a good sign and should continue not just this year but into the future. And then on the IB side, we're still counting on growth for the year in that business. And then we have launches in a bunch of our businesses like Leptra and other products. So we're feeling good as we look out at the pipeline. We'll actually pick up a little bit more here and be running more flat on a revenue line basis. And I'm not planning or looking at anything past that -- I want the company to plan around that. I don't think it's overly conservative. But if we plan around it, we'll make some smart decisions if we see upside later in the year, more the better."

Does this give you an -- I'm curious, what would be the lag between -- when the shareholder vote takes place and when you actually close the transaction? And are you looking to complete a $2 billion share buyback within that window? Or is that just something that can be executed until December 31 regardless of if it's Dow, DuPont or just DuPont alone?"

And then I hate to put an exact date on it, but I would say we're shooting for October, November kind of close of the transaction. So both in the second quarter shareholder votes by both Dow and DuPont shareholders, October, November close. We're in great shape on all the filings in the key jurisdictions around the world, and the big one is China, Europe, Brazil and obviously the U.S. All that's in motion.

Now our original guidance for the year assumed a slight increase. So I would agree with you. We're feeling some of that lift. However, the weather is always a big element here, and we've seen in that period here in the Midwest. Last couple of days have been great. We've seen planting jump. I think we're about 30% planted as of today, and that will be consistent again with what we're hearing and probably slightly earlier in the season than the historical average, which would be more about 16%. Historically though, the planted acres doesn't always equate yield. We could still see some issues the summer, especially during pollination where we know we can really take the top off of the yield on any of those crops. So kind of like you, we're in a wait-and-see mode. If weather's perfect and we get many 4 million acres, you're right, we'll continue to see commodity prices at the low end of, I would say what I'm calling the new normal range of that 3 20 to 4 20 kind of operating range.

If you do look at North America, you're right, our price is up in the market. And as we said to you, we're attributing that to a couple of areas. Mostly, we think it's on new technology. About half of our lineup in North America is brand-new in the last 2 years. And you'll note that we do impact trialing. And even on farm trailing for a couple of years ahead of time so growers get a chance to take a good look at new genetics before they commit fully, and so a big part of our lift in North America is that they went all in and a lot of that new the technology this season."

I would like to share my perspective on the first quarter, then I'll update you on our progress with our 3 critical initiatives as well as our planned merger of equals with Dow. 
Overall, I was pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter. Despite continued challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we delivered operating earnings of $1.26 per share even with the last year's quarter. Excluding $0.10 per share of negative currency, operating earnings rose 8%. Sales declined 2%, excluding currency, reflecting the current environment. The weakening U.S. dollar gave us some relief. 
I don't want to steal any thunder from Jim, but it's worth saying a couple of things about Ag's first quarter. Much of the quarter's strength was due to Ag. Solid execution in Ag, our largest segment, enabled a strong start to the North American corn season. I'm also very pleased with our results in the Safrinha season as we delivered strong volume growth. Nick and Jim will comment more on all that in a moment. 
Looking beyond Ag, as I mentioned, most of our other segments performed well. One worth calling out is Nutrition & Health, where we had broad-based volume growth and significant operating margin expansion. 
Let me give you a couple examples of new products that contributed to our growth in N&H. First, Supro, our new best-in-class isolated soy protein for dry powdered beverages; and second, our new long-life greek yogurts in China. Probiotics increased sales 30% as our productivity efforts have freed up capacity to respond to strong customer demand. I was pleased to see operating margins expand in 4 of our 6 segments, including progress with our global cost savings and restructuring plan.  
In sum, most of our businesses exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We had a good start to the year. Yet planting is just beginning in the Northern Hemisphere, and at this point, it's too early to call the year for Ag. There are still a number of difficult macro variables, and we want to see how those factors play out. 
Now let me give you an update on our progress with the 3 critical priorities I outlined when I became CEO. As a reminder, we said we were committed to shrinking our cost structure, improving our working capital performance and reducing our capital expenditures. We strongly believe we need to improve our performance in all 3 areas as we want to benchmark against best-in-class companies in all of our businesses. The encouraging part is the quality of the leadership team, including their desire to win, which has impressed me about DuPont from the start. 
The point of our global cost savings and restructuring plan is to strengthen the competitiveness of our business while reducing our cost by $1 billion on on a run rate basis by year-end. Consistent with this target, we plan to show you a net year-over-year savings of $730 million for full year 2016. We made good progress with this objective in the first quarter. In fact, we are exiting the quarter down about $135 million in operating costs, mainly in SG&A. 
One area where we've taken significant action is corporate costs. Already, year-over-year, we are down 44% on an operating earnings basis. I applaud the teams for their hard work in getting us here. This quarter puts us well on our way toward a $200 million year-over-year reduction in corporate costs. Also our global cost savings and restructuring plan is separate from, and incremental to, the cost synergies we expect to capture in connection with our planned merger of equals with Dow. The actions we have taken to abolish the matrix organizations have given our businesses full control of their P&Ls, enabling faster decision making. The company is visibly moving at a faster clip. 
Turning to working capital. Earlier, we set goals for improvement by business for 2016. In the first quarter, we launched a company-wide project to improve working capital. We see opportunity in inventory, first and foremost, but also in payables and receivables. Our first quarter results reflect our focus on working capital and capital spending, resulting in a $300 million improvement in free cash flow year-over-year, excluding Chemours. We continue to expect to deliver improvements in working capital over the medium term. That said, this year's working capital performance will reflect pressure from our cost reduction programs, including severance payments, which are necessary to support our long-term objectives. 
Our capital spending in 2016 is expected to total $1.1 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. That's a decline of 21%. We spent about $360 million on CapEx in the first quarter, and we reviewed each and every dollar before we spent it with a close eye on expected returns. Our first quarter CapEx spend is 14% below last year, again excluding Chemours. 
As we work toward our planned merger with Dow and the intended separation into 3 highly focused independent businesses, I am pleased with the progress the teams are making. We achieved a number of milestones toward closing the merger in recent weeks. On March 1, we filed our initial Form S-4 registration statement and recently filed the first amendment. That process is proceeding along smoothly. The Form S-4 will become effective after we complete the review process with the SEC, which we currently anticipate will be no later than the end of the second quarter. The special stockholder meetings for both companies' shareholders to vote on the merger will take place thereafter. 
We also have submitted key regulatory filings related to the merger in the major jurisdictions where we operate. We always expected a thorough review process, and we are working closely with regulators in all the relevant jurisdictions to complete that process. 
We continue to expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Integration planning is well under way. We have formed a Joint Integration Management Office. Dow and DuPont teams are working directly together on plans to execute the merger, capture synergies and prepare for the intended business separations. The team is working diligently to develop execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as independent business units as soon as possible after the merger closes. In coordination with the Joint Integration Management Office, each of the 3 businesses is working to identify and plan for the right operating structure for their specific needs. 
Another important point I'd like to make is our synergy targets for the combined company remain on track. We have 27 teams focused on different categories of cost, and they are very clear about what the goal is. Our confidence in the targets we established in December has done nothing but go up. After diving into the details, we continue to believe there will be at least $3 billion in cost and $1 billion in gross synergies on a run rate basis. We have benchmarked costs against industry peers alongside MacKenzie, and they have confirmed that the $3 billion is achievable. We continue to expect to capture $1.3 billion in Ag, $1.5 billion in Material Science and $300 million in Specialty Products cost synergies. 
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Operating earnings of $1.26 per share were even with prior year and up 8% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro environment, particularly on cost savings, and a strong start to the North American corn season in Ag positively impacted the quarter.  Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter declined 2%. Local pricing gains in Ag and Industrial Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in most of the remaining segments. Currency continued to negatively impact sales by an additional 4 percentage points in the quarter. 
I'd like to highlight where we're seeing some positives from a regional perspective, particularly in our developing markets, which represented about 30% of our first quarter sales. In the quarter, sales in developing markets were up 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Agriculture and Nutrition & Health in Europe and Asia Pacific, principally China. Local pricing gains in Latin America and Europe were a result of mix enrichment and actions to offset currency, primarily within Agriculture. 
Turning to Slide 4. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to segment results. Segment results when you exclude currency were up $0.02 per share in the quarter on cost savings, local price and product mix gains in Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health. Lower corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.05 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than the prior year as a result of our 2016 cost savings program. A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.05. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation, and we are seeing the full benefit of this program here. A decrease in net after-tax exchange losses contributed $0.02 to earnings in the quarter. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings. 
Let's turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Protection Solutions was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Nutrition & Health increased on a broad-based volume growth and cost savings, which more than offset the negative currency that they saw. Operating margins in this segment improved 240 basis points and have grown year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected pricing gains on new product introductions in bioactives, increased demand for biomaterials and the absence of prior year onetime costs in clean technologies. Operating margins improved 250 basis points in the quarter for Industrial Biosciences. 
Protection Solutions operating earnings increased $9 million as lower costs and improved plant utilization at the Chambers Works facility were partially offset by lower volumes and the negative currency impact. Operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter here. 
In Electronics & Communications, operating earnings decreased $20 million as cost savings and increased demand for Tedlar film were more than offset by competitive pressures in Solamet paste, lower demand in consumer electronics and a $16 million litigation expense. I'd like to highlight that while volumes in Solamet paste were down year-over-year, we did see sequential volume growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, and we grew market share following the launch of our PV19B late last year. 
Agriculture operating earnings declined $37 million year-over-year as local price and products mix gains and cost savings were more than offset by an $83 million negative currency impact, lower volumes and about $40 million negative impact from LaPorte shutdown due to lost sales and inventory write-offs. Jim will provide further details on the first quarter performance with Agriculture later in the call. 
Performance Materials operating earnings declined $44 million as lower costs and increased demand in Asia Pacific automotive markets were more than offset by lower demand for ethylene and ethylene-based products, lower local price and negative impact from currency. The price decline was driven by lower ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 50% year-over-year and we saw competitive pressure in commoditized products. 
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under Events & Presentations. I encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results, including our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.2 billion reflects Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow in the quarter. Our free cash flow improved by about $500 million year-over-year with about $200 million of the improvement due to the absence of Chemours. The remainder of the improvement is due to lower working capital and CapEx in the first quarter. Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2015 balance, which reflects our nominal seasonal shifts. Primary uses of cash in the quarter related to funding our seasonal Agriculture working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends. 
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our objective is to complete $2 billion in share repurchases in 2016. However, the planned merger of equals with Dow and the associated impact from SEC rules and regulations affects our trading windows. After the shareholder vote, we'll evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and plan to make repurchases. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 per share from $2.95 to $3.10 previously announced. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.20 per share versus a previously communicated estimate of $0.30 per share. The U.S. dollar has weakened against most currencies since the estimate we provided in January. 
For the full year, we now expect our base tax rate to be about 24%, an increase from our prior estimate of 23% due to the geographic mix of earnings. This results in a $0.10 headwind from higher base tax rate in the outlook versus our prior year.  
Our guidance continues to reflect a $0.64 per share benefit from a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. 
While the businesses outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, about half of this was due to a stronger-than-expected start to the season in Agriculture. The remainder was due to the underlying performance of the businesses, and that is what we are reflecting in our revised outlook for the full year. 
For the first half 2016, we expect operating earnings to be even with prior year as the timing benefits, primarily within Agriculture, from a stronger-than-expected start to North American corn season are anticipated to largely be offset in the second quarter. 
We continue to expect full year net sales to be down low single digits, percent-wise, versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in Agriculture. 
Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar is stronger than last year against most currencies primarily the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales are expected to be about even with prior year.  We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 17% to 23% when we take out currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
We remain cautious on our outlook for 2016 as market conditions continue to remain challenging. In Agriculture, the fundamentals have not changed since the outlook we provided in January. Net farm income is declining and seed and crop protection suppliers have abundance of inventories globally. Economists are currently forecasting lower global industrial production in key markets, including the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and China. China's economic slowdown continues, particularly with its industrial, real estate and financial sectors, impacting the Asia Pacific region.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight where we stand on our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. As we previously communicated, we expect this plan will generate $1 billion on a run rate basis, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in 2016 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which we weighted towards the second half of 2016. 
For the first quarter, our operating costs, which includes SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $135 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 7% decline in costs year-over-year. SG&A costs declined about $110 million or 9% versus last year on cost savings and currency benefits. Our corporate costs on an operating earnings basis decreased 44% year-over-year and highlights that the actions we outlined in December are truly generating results. We are on track to deliver our 2016 commitment of a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses, improving to about a 1.3% as a percent of sales. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results in Agriculture."
268053,329372963,962858,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected with farmers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we're not seeing anything significant",936,"Thanks, Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected with farmers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we're not seeing anything significantly different in market conditions from what we shared with you earlier this year. But even in this difficult environment, we remain focused and are executing on the variables that are within our control. And I think our first quarter performance clearly illustrates that. 
Now I'm focused on 3 very clear priorities. First, delivering on our 2016 cost savings and operating earnings commitments. And our results for the quarter indicate we're firmly on track to do that. Secondly, I've been personally spending significant time reviewing our R&D programs with our research teams to ensure we're delivering on our exciting pipeline of new genetics, biotech traits and Crop Protection products on schedule. Lastly, from our announced merger with Dow, our teams are working with great urgency to create a world-leading production Ag business, and we're developing detailed plans to capture the $1.3 billion of cost synergies. 
Even though this is challenging work, you can feel the excitement of the teams. 
In addition to these 3 priorities, I also spend my time minimizing distractions, ensuring our teams keep their focus on delivering results for our stakeholders during this exciting time of change. And as I mentioned, our results in the first quarter demonstrated strong execution in challenging market conditions. Results were better than we expected, primarily due to higher corn area in North America, earlier timing of shipments to customers consistent with that strong start we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 and stronger sunflower sales in Europe based on the performance of our newest products. Currency, while still a significant headwind compared to last year, was also a little better than we anticipated.
What I'm proudest of is we were able to deliver 2% higher prices across the segment even in this highly competitive market environment. In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally and, most importantly, in North America. In Crop Protection, we took decisive pricing actions to mitigate the stronger U.S. dollar in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and, in fact, local pricing actions fully offset the impact of currency in Latin America. 
Now in addition to local pricing gains, corn seed volumes were higher than the prior year from sales in North America, consistent with the recent USDA reports indicating higher expected corn acres this year, and in Brazil's Safrinha season. Our increases in corn and sunflower volume were more than offset by the lower insecticide sales in Latin America and in sales to other third parties. Additional offsets included the impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and from lower soybean volumes.  Now most of the decline in insecticide volumes can be tied to Brazil's low pest pressure, high industry inventories and the impact of insect protected soybean varieties. 
Now turning to our pipeline. As planned, we made our first sales of Zorvec fungicide for disease control in Korea, Australia and China in the first quarter. We expect Zorvec to be very competitive in the $2 billion market for blight and downy mildew control, offering potato, grape and vegetable growers consistent, long-lasting control with a favorable environmental profile. We successfully launched Leptra insect protected corn hybrids in Brazil in the Safrinha season and initial indications of performance are good. Leptra's strong value proposition is also allowing us to recapture price in that market. Strong customer interest and an aggressive seed production plan have us well positioned to ramp up Leptra to as much 1/3 of our volume in the upcoming summer season in one of the fastest technology introductions in Pioneer history. In North America soybeans, we are currently introducing varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology in a very limited launch. While we didn't plan for large volumes, this will allow our sales reps and customers to test the performance of these soybeans as we prepare for our full launch in 2017 pending regulatory approvals. 
In addition to all of that, we had a really exciting announcement this past week. We announced our intention to commercialize our first corn hybrids developed through the application of CRISPR-Cas advanced breeding technology within the next 5 years. While this is a first step, our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation for success for future products developed with this important innovation in plant breeding. 
We now anticipate results for the full year to be a little stronger than what we shared with you in January, primarily due to the recent weakening of the dollar against many global currencies, including the reais, and from higher corn-planted acre. Now this will partially be offset by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter seed sales to first quarter 2017. This is a result of the enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market approach in the Southern U.S., similar to the advantaged approach we take in the Midwest. Additionally, we'll have some unplanned costs as a result of our recent decision regarding the LaPorte insecticide unit, from the write-off and disposal of in-process inventory and to dismantle the facility. 
We had a good start to the year. We have a lot going on in Agriculture, and I'm very excited about the progress. I'm confident the team is focused on delivering on our commitments, preparing for the merger and advancing our pipeline. 
Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

Thanks for that question, and we know those comments are out there. As we said back in January, we're -- we just weren't seeing much change in the conditions in the marketplace from where we launched back in August or September. So we've had our pricing cards out there for a number of months. So when I look at pricing, I think of it -- or in that area, I think of it in 3 specific ways. First is card price, and that's that year-over-year same technology, same market card pricing. And as we said back in January, our card pricing is generally flat year-over-year. The second impact in our numbers then would be due to mix. And we're seeing strong demand in our order book for our newest technology. About 50% of our lineup in North America is from genetics that we've put in the market in the last 2 years. So as growers have a chance to look at that 2 consecutive years in our yield trials, they really jumped on that. So we're seeing a nice lift in overall mix. And then last would be in the discounting area. And so these discounts come in a number of different areas whether it's early -- our early buy discounts or cash discounts. And overall, I would say we're seeing maybe a slightly elevated level of discounts, but nothing really out of the ordinary than you might expect. Folks took good advantage of some of the programs that we had out there. I would also remind you that our direct sales model in North America gives us great visibility of our products and our pricing, especially at that net price level. So we see almost on a real-time basis purchases and what's going there. So I think overall, what this speaks to is a strong focus by our organization and an execution intensity in really driving the plan that we put out there back in August and September."

So we have a big opportunity there, mostly the biggest piece in inventory so we're very, very focused there. And we are going to have some headwind this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of severance costs and all that. So -- but again, that's to the benefit of the company going forward. But -- this won't happen just this year, but we clearly will have traction this year. I think as you saw in the first quarter, we had slight improvement already in working capital and generated an additional $300 million of free cash flow this year over last year also because CapEx by the way was lower by 14% year-over-year. So -- and we're starting to get really good focus. Nick and I had operating reviews with every business over the last week and working capital is a big part of the conversation with the teams.

So you're seeing some of that year-over-year. As we get into the second half of the year, we continue to drive the launches of Cyazypyr around the world. If I separate Brazil, Rynaxypyr sales growth -- has grown volumes every year since its launch, and we'll expect to see good inroads. And I would say, our Crop Protection business in North America started off pretty strong here this year. Looking at the on-the-ground sales versus our out-the-door business, we feel really good about our penetration there. It's still early in the season to talk about full year. We still have a lot to go. And when I think about corn share now, again a little early to call share. Yes, agreeing with you, no doubt we're seeing volume increases in North America consistent with that USDA report on the 94 essentially million acres. We're seeing volume growth based on our new technology, and our teams are going to stay really focused. But like I said, it's way too early to talk about seed share. As of today, we're about 30% planted in North America. That is elevated. Normally, we'd be about 16% for this time of the year. And again, you saw some of that volume increase flow through in our first quarter. But we'll see how things shake out around share for the full year."

I'd say fairly significantly in such a short period of time, the reductions we made, which were mostly done within R&D, really put us at about this run rate, though, this company has historically run at on R&D, which I'm very comfortable with. Kind of like our 10-year average run rate on a percentage of sales basis is about right where we've always been. So that's kind of where we're ending up."

Some of the businesses looks like growth is going to be very nice here and some product introductions in the second half of the year. But let me just start by overall saying to you we're still counting on the year being relatively flat from a volume, price or an organic standpoint as we move forward. So if we had a minus 2 in the first quarter, just some slight improvement kind of in the second half of the year, and then it really depends by business. As you look out what it's going to be in Nutrition & Health, obviously good. We're seeing really broad-based growth there. And by the way, the probiotics area is really hot, like 30% growth, and we're actually getting more product out the door, some more efficiency in our facility. So that's a good sign and should continue not just this year but into the future. And then on the IB side, we're still counting on growth for the year in that business. And then we have launches in a bunch of our businesses like Leptra and other products. So we're feeling good as we look out at the pipeline that we'll actually pick up a little bit more here and be running more flat on a revenue line basis. And I'm not planning or looking at anything past that. I want the company to plan around that. I don't think it's overly conservative. But if we plan around it, we'll make some smart decisions.

Now our original guidance for the year assumed a slight increase. So I would agree with you we're feeling some of that lift. However, the weather is always a big element here, and we've seen a wet period here in the Midwest. Last couple of days have been great. We've seen planting jump. I think we're about 30% planted as of today, and that would be consistent again with what we're hearing, that we're probably slightly earlier this season than the historical average, which would be more about 16%. Historically, though, the planted acres don't always equate to yield. We could still see some issues this summer, especially during pollination where we know we can really take the top off of yield on any of those crops. So kind of like you, we're in a wait-and-see mode. If weather's perfect and we get 94 million acres, you're right, we'll continue to see commodity prices at that low end of, I would say, what I'm calling the new normal range of that 3 20 to 4 20 kind of operating range.

I would like to share my perspective on the first quarter, then I'll update you on our progress with our 3 critical initiatives as well as our planned merger of equals with Dow. 
Overall, I was pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter. Despite continued challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we delivered operating earnings of $1.26 per share; even with the last year's quarter. Excluding $0.10 per share of negative currency, operating earnings rose 8%. Sales declined 2%, excluding currency, reflecting the current environment. The weakening U.S. dollar gave us some relief. 
I don't want to steal any thunder from Jim, but it's worth saying a couple of things about Ag's first quarter. Much of the quarter's strength was due to Ag. Solid execution in Ag, our largest segment, enabled a strong start to the North American corn season. I'm also very pleased with our results in the Safrinha season as we delivered strong volume growth. Nick and Jim will comment more on all that in a moment. 
Looking beyond Ag, as I mentioned, most of our other segments performed well. One worth calling out is Nutrition & Health, where we had broad-based volume growth and significant operating margin expansion. 
Let me give you a couple examples of new products that contributed to our growth in N&H. First, Supro, our new best-in-class isolated soy protein for dry powdered beverages; and second, our new long-life Greek yogurts in China. Probiotics increased sales 30% as our productivity efforts have freed up capacity to respond to strong customer demand. I was pleased to see operating margins expand in 4 of our 6 segments, including progress with our global cost savings and restructuring plan.  
In sum, most of our businesses exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We had a good start to the year. Yet planting is just beginning in the Northern Hemisphere, and at this point, it's too early to call the year for Ag. There are still a number of difficult macro variables, and we want to see how those factors play out. 
Now let me give you an update on our progress with the 3 critical priorities I outlined when I became CEO. As a reminder, we said we were committed to shrinking our cost structure, improving our working capital performance and reducing our capital expenditures. We strongly believe we need to improve our performance in all 3 areas as we want to benchmark against best-in-class companies in all of our businesses. The encouraging part is the quality of the leadership team, including their desire to win, which has impressed me about DuPont from the start. 
The point of our global cost savings and restructuring plan is to strengthen the competitiveness of our business while reducing our costs by $1 billion on a run rate basis by year-end. Consistent with this target, we plan to show you a net year-over-year savings of $730 million for full year 2016. We made good progress with this objective in the first quarter. In fact, we are exiting the quarter down about $135 million in operating costs, mainly in SG&A. 
One area where we've taken significant action is corporate costs. Already, year-over-year, we are down 44% on an operating earnings basis. I applaud the teams for their hard work in getting us here. This quarter puts us well on our way toward a $200 million year-over-year reduction in corporate costs. Also our global cost savings and restructuring plan is separate from, and incremental to, the cost synergies we expect to capture in connection with our planned merger of equals with Dow. The actions we have taken to abolish the matrix organizations have given our businesses full control of their P&Ls, enabling faster decision making. The company is visibly moving at a faster clip. 
Turning to working capital. Earlier, we set goals for improvement by business for 2016. In the first quarter, we launched a company-wide project to improve working capital. We see opportunity in inventory, first and foremost, but also in payables and receivables. Our first quarter results reflect our focus on working capital and capital spending, resulting in a $300 million improvement in free cash flow year-over-year, excluding Chemours. We continue to expect to deliver improvements in working capital over the medium term. That said, this year's working capital performance will reflect pressure from our cost reduction programs, including severance payments, which are necessary to support our long-term objectives. 
Our capital spending in 2016 is expected to total $1.1 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. That's a decline of 21%. We spent about $360 million on CapEx in the first quarter, and we reviewed each and every dollar before we spent it with a close eye on expected returns. Our first quarter CapEx spend is 14% below last year, again excluding Chemours. 
As we work toward our planned merger with Dow and the intended separation into 3 highly focused independent businesses, I am pleased with the progress the teams are making. We achieved a number of milestones toward closing the merger in recent weeks. On March 1, we filed our initial Form S-4 registration statement and recently filed the first amendment. That process is proceeding along smoothly. The Form S-4 will become effective after we complete the review process with the SEC, which we currently anticipate will be no later than the end of the second quarter. The special stockholder meetings for both companies' shareholders to vote on the merger will take place thereafter. 
We also have submitted key regulatory filings related to the merger in the major jurisdictions where we operate. We always expected a thorough review process, and we are working closely with regulators in all the relevant jurisdictions to complete that process. 
We continue to expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Integration planning is well under way. We have formed a Joint Integration Management Office. Dow and DuPont teams are working directly together on plans to execute the merger, capture synergies and prepare for the intended business separations. The team is working diligently to develop execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as independent business units as soon as possible after the merger closes. In coordination with the Joint Integration Management Office, each of the 3 businesses is working to identify and plan for the right operating structure for their specific needs. 
Another important point I'd like to make is our synergy targets for the combined company remain on track. We have 27 teams focused on different categories of cost, and they are very clear about what the goal is. Our confidence in the targets we established in December has done nothing but go up. After diving into the details, we continue to believe there will be at least $3 billion in cost and $1 billion in gross synergies on a run rate basis. We have benchmarked costs against industry peers alongside MacKenzie, and they have confirmed that the $3 billion is achievable. We continue to expect to capture $1.3 billion in Ag, $1.5 billion in Material Science and $300 million in Specialty Products cost synergies. 
Now I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail."

Let's start with the details of the first quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of $1.26 per share were even with prior year and up 8% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro environment, particularly on",1544,"Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the first quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of $1.26 per share were even with prior year and up 8% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro environment, particularly on cost savings, and a strong start to the North American corn season in Ag positively impacted the quarter.  Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter declined 2%. Local pricing gains in Ag and Industrial Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in most of the remaining segments. Currency continued to negatively impact sales by an additional 4 percentage points in the quarter. 
I'd like to highlight where we're seeing some positives from a regional perspective, particularly in our developing markets, which represented about 30% of our first quarter sales. In the quarter, sales in developing markets were up 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Agriculture and Nutrition & Health in Europe and Asia Pacific, principally China. Local pricing gains in Latin America and Europe were a result of mix enrichment and actions to offset currency, primarily within Agriculture. 
Turning to Slide 4. Consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to segment results. Segment results when you exclude currency were up $0.02 per share in the quarter on cost savings, local price and product mix gains in Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health. Lower corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.05 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than the prior year as a result of our 2016 cost savings program. A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.05. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation, and we are seeing the full benefit of this program here. A decrease in net after-tax exchange losses contributed $0.02 to earnings in the quarter. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings. 
Let's turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Protection Solutions was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Nutrition & Health increased on a broad-based volume growth and cost savings, which more than offset the negative currency that they saw. Operating margins in this segment improved 240 basis points and have grown year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters. 
Growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected pricing gains on new product introductions in bioactives, increased demand for biomaterials and the absence of prior year onetime costs in clean technologies. Operating margins improved 250 basis points in the quarter for Industrial Biosciences. 
Protection Solutions operating earnings increased $9 million as lower costs and improved plant utilization at the Chambers Works facility were partially offset by lower volumes and the negative currency impact. Operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter here. 
In Electronics & Communications, operating earnings decreased $20 million as cost savings and increased demand for Tedlar film were more than offset by competitive pressures in Solamet paste, lower demand in consumer electronics and a $16 million litigation expense. I'd like to highlight that while volumes in Solamet paste were down year-over-year, we did see sequential volume growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, and we grew market share following the launch of our PV19B late last year. 
Agriculture operating earnings declined $37 million year-over-year as local price and products mix gains and cost savings were more than offset by an $83 million negative currency impact, lower volumes and about $40 million negative impact from LaPorte shutdown due to lost sales and inventory write-offs. Jim will provide further details on the first quarter performance with Agriculture later in the call. 
Performance Materials operating earnings declined $44 million as lower costs and increased demand in Asia Pacific automotive markets were more than offset by lower demand for ethylene and ethylene-based products, lower local price and negative impact from currency. The price decline was driven by lower ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 50% year-over-year and we saw competitive pressure in commoditized products. 
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under Events & Presentations. I encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results, including our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.2 billion reflects Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow in the quarter. Our free cash flow improved by about $500 million year-over-year with about $200 million of the improvement due to the absence of Chemours. The remainder of the improvement is due to lower working capital and CapEx in the first quarter. Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2015 balance, which reflects our nominal seasonal shifts. Primary uses of cash in the quarter related to funding our seasonal Agriculture working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends. 
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our objective is to complete $2 billion in share repurchases in 2016. However, the planned merger of equals with Dow and the associated impact from SEC rules and regulations affects our trading windows. After the shareholder vote, we'll evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and plan to make repurchases. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 per share from $2.95 to $3.10 previously announced. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.20 per share versus a previously communicated estimate of $0.30 per share. The U.S. dollar has weakened against most currencies since the estimate we provided in January. 
For the full year, we now expect our base tax rate to be about 24%, an increase from our prior estimate of 23% due to the geographic mix of earnings. This results in a $0.10 headwind from higher base tax rate in the outlook versus our prior year.  
Our guidance continues to reflect a $0.64 per share benefit from a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. 
While the businesses outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, about half of this was due to a stronger-than-expected start to the season in Agriculture. The remainder was due to the underlying performance of the businesses, and that is what we are reflecting in our revised outlook for the full year. 
For the first half 2016, we expect operating earnings to be even with prior year as the timing benefits, primarily within Agriculture, from a stronger-than-expected start to North American corn season are anticipated to largely be offset in the second quarter. 
We continue to expect full year net sales to be down low single digits, percent-wise, versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in Agriculture. 
Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar is stronger than last year against most currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales are expected to be about even with prior year.  We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 17% to 23% when we take out currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
We remain cautious on our outlook for 2016 as market conditions continue to remain challenging. In Agriculture, the fundamentals have not changed since the outlook we provided in January. Net farm income is declining and seed and crop protection suppliers have an abundance of inventories globally. Economists are currently forecasting lower global industrial production in key markets, including the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and China. China's economic slowdown continues, particularly with its industrial, real estate and financial sectors, impacting the Asia Pacific region.
Turning now to Slide 8. I'd like to highlight where we stand on our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. As we previously communicated, we expect this plan will generate $1 billion on a run rate basis, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in 2016 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which we weighted towards the second half of 2016. 
For the first quarter, our operating costs, which includes SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $135 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 7% decline in costs year-over-year. SG&A costs declined about $110 million or 9% versus last year on cost savings and currency benefits. Our corporate costs on an operating earnings basis decreased 44% year-over-year and highlights that the actions we outlined in December are truly generating results. We are on track to deliver our 2016 commitment of a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses, improving to about a 1.3% as a percent of sales. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results in Agriculture."
268053,329372963,963203,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected with farmers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we're not seeing anything significant",936,"Thanks, Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected with farmers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we're not seeing anything significantly different in market conditions from what we shared with you earlier this year. But even in this difficult environment, we remain focused and are executing on the variables that are within our control. And I think our first quarter performance clearly illustrates that. 
Now I'm focused on three very clear priorities. First, delivering on our 2016 cost savings and operating earnings commitments. And our results for the quarter indicate we're firmly on track to do that. Secondly, I've been personally spending significant time reviewing our R&D programs with our research teams to ensure we're delivering on our exciting pipeline of new genetics, biotech traits and Crop Protection products on schedule. Lastly, from our announced merger with Dow, our teams are working with great urgency to create a world-leading production Ag business, and we're developing detailed plans to capture the $1.3 billion of cost synergies. 
Even though this is challenging work, you can feel the excitement of the teams. 
In addition to these 3 priorities, I also spend my time minimizing distractions, ensuring our teams keep their focus on delivering results for our stakeholders during this exciting time of change. And as I mentioned, our results in the first quarter demonstrated strong execution in challenging market conditions. Results were better than we expected, primarily due to higher corn area in North America, earlier timing of shipments to customers consistent with that strong start we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 and stronger sunflower sales in Europe based on the performance of our newest products. Currency, while still a significant headwind compared to last year, was also a little better than we anticipated.
What I'm proudest of is we were able to deliver 2% higher prices across the segment even in this highly competitive market environment. In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally and, most importantly, in North America. In Crop Protection, we took decisive pricing actions to mitigate a stronger U.S. dollar in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and, in fact, local pricing actions fully offset the impact of currency in Latin America. 
Now in addition to local pricing gains, corn seed volumes were higher than the prior year from sales in North America, consistent with the recent USDA reports indicating higher expected corn acres this year, and in Brazil's Safrinha season. Our increases in corn and sunflower volume were more than offset by the lower insecticide sales in Latin America and in sales to other third parties. Additional offsets included the impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and from lower soybean volumes.  Now most of the decline in insecticide volumes can be tied to Brazil's low pest pressure, high industry inventories and the impact of insect protected soybean varieties. 
Now turning to our pipeline. As planned, we made our first sales of Zorvec fungicide for disease control in Korea, Australia and China in the first quarter. We expect Zorvec to be very competitive in the $2 billion market for blight and downy mildew control, offering potato, grape and vegetable growers consistent, long-lasting control with a favorable environmental profile. We successfully launched Leptra insect protected corn hybrids in Brazil in the Safrinha season and initial indications of performance are good. Leptra's strong value proposition is also allowing us to recapture price in that market. Strong customer interest and an aggressive seed production plan have us well positioned to ramp up Leptra to as much 1/3 of our volume in the upcoming summer season in one of the fastest technology introductions in Pioneer history. In North America soybeans, we are currently introducing varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology in a very limited launch. While we didn't plan for large volumes, this will allow our sales reps and customers to test the performance of these soybeans as we prepare for our full launch in 2017 pending regulatory approvals. 
In addition to all of that, we had a really exciting announcement this past week. We announced our intention to commercialize our first corn hybrids developed through the application of CRISPR-Cas advanced breeding technology within the next 5 years. While this is a first step, our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation for success for future products developed with this important innovation in plant breeding. 
We now anticipate results for the full year to be a little stronger than what we shared with you in January, primarily due to the recent weakening of the dollar against many global currencies, including the reais, and from higher corn-planted acre. Now this will partially be offset by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter seed sales to first quarter 2017. This is a result of the enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market approach in the Southern U.S., similar to the advantaged approach we take in the Midwest. Additionally, we'll have some unplanned costs as a result of our recent decision regarding the LaPorte insecticide unit, from the write-off and disposal of in-process inventory and to dismantle the facility. 
We had a good start to the year. We have a lot going on in Agriculture, and I'm very excited about the progress. I'm confident the team is focused on delivering on our commitments, preparing for the merger and advancing our pipeline. 
Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

Thanks for that question, and we know those comments are out there. As we said back in January, we're -- we just weren't seeing much change in the conditions in the marketplace from where we launched back in August or September. So we've had our pricing cards out there for a number of months. So when I look at pricing, I think of it -- or in that area, I think of it in three specific ways. First is card price, and that's that year-over-year same technology, same market card pricing. And as we said back in January, our card pricing is generally flat year-over-year. The second impact in our numbers then would be due to mix. And we're seeing strong demand in our order book for our newest technology. About 50% of our lineup in North America is from genetics that we've put in the market in the last 2 years. So as growers have a chance to look at that 2 consecutive years in our yield trials, they really jumped on that. So we're seeing a nice lift in overall mix. And then last would be in the discounting area. And so these discounts come in a number of different areas whether it's early -- our early buy discounts or cash discounts. And overall, I would say we're seeing maybe a slightly elevated level of discounts, but nothing really out of the ordinary than you might expect. Folks took good advantage of some of the programs that we had out there. I would also remind you that our direct sales model in North America gives us great visibility of our products and our pricing, especially at that net price level. So we see almost on a real-time basis purchases and what's going there. So I think overall, what this speaks to is a strong focus by our organization and an execution intensity in really driving the plan that we put out there back in August and September."

So we have a big opportunity there, mostly the biggest piece in inventory so we're very, very focused there. And we are going to have some headwind this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of severance costs and all that. So -- but again, that's for the benefit of the company going forward. But -- this won't happen just this year, but we clearly will have traction this year. I think as you saw in the first quarter, we had slight improvement already in working capital and generated an additional $300 million of free cash flow this year over last year, also because CapEx by the way was lower by 14% year-over-year. So -- and we're starting to get really good focus. Nick and I had operating reviews with every business over the last week and working capital is a big part of the conversation with the teams.

That was mostly tied to the insecticide business and the bulk of that in Brazil. And we're still chasing 2 consecutive years of low pest pressure there. We're feeling the impact of insect protected varieties of soybeans that are in that market. And overall, I'd say channel inventories there are still pretty elevated based on the 2 years. In our insecticide business as well in Crop Protection, we're feeling the impact of the LaPorte shutdown that we had. Most of that is related to Vydate. We have essentially replaced all of the methomyl that we had been selling in previous years now through third parties, but it's just been really tough to find good quality sources of oxamyl. So you're seeing some of that year-over-year. As we get into the second half of the year, we continue to drive the launches of Cyazypyr around the world. If I separate Brazil, Rynaxypyr sales growth -- has grown volumes every year since its launch, and we'll expect to see good inroads. And I would say, our Crop Protection business in North America started off pretty strong here this year. Looking at the on-the-ground sales versus our out-the-door business, we feel really good about our penetration there. It's still early in the season to talk about full year. We still have a lot to go. And when I think about corn share now, again a little early to call share. Yes, agreeing with you, no doubt we're seeing volume increases in North America consistent with that USDA report on the 94 essentially million acres. We're seeing volume growth based on our new technology, and our teams are going to stay really focused. But like I said, it's way too early to talk about seed share. As of today, we're about 30% planted in North America. That is elevated. Normally, we'd be about 16% for this time of the year. And again, you saw some of that volume increase flow through in our first quarter. But we'll see how things shake out around share for the full year."

So if we had a minus 2 in the first quarter, just some slight improvement kind of in the second half of the year. And then it really depends by business, as you look out what it's going to be in Nutrition & Health, obviously good. We're seeing really broad-based growth there. And by the way, the probiotics area is really hot, like 30% growth, and we're actually getting more product out the door with more efficiency in our facility. So that's a good sign and should continue not just this year but into the future. And then on the IB side, we're still counting on growth for the year in that business.

There's no doubt that our order book and our volumes in the first quarter indicated stronger increases in corn area in the U.S., and that's consistent with that USDA report. Now our original guidance for the year assumed a slight increase. So I would agree with you we're feeling some of that lift. However, the weather is always a big element here, and we've seen a wet period here in the Midwest. Last couple of days have been great. We've seen planting jump. I think we're about 30% planted as of today, and that would be consistent again with what we're hearing, that we're probably slightly earlier this season than the historical average; which would be more about 16%. Historically, though, planted acres don't always equate to yield. We could still see some issues this summer, especially during pollination where we know we can really take the top off of yield on any of those crops. So kind of like you, we're in a wait-and-see mode. If weather's perfect and we get 94 million acres, you're right, we'll continue to see commodity prices at that low end of, I would say, what I'm calling the new normal range of that $3.20 to $4.20 kind of operating range.

So collaborating with them up front to think about how do we tie, how do we connect the best technology that we can to that acre opportunity for grower productivity. If you do look at North America, you're right, our price is up in the market. And as we said to you, we're attributing that to a couple of areas. Mostly, we think it's on new technology. About half of our lineup in North America is brand new in the last 2 years. And you'll know that we do impact trialing and even on-farm trialing for a couple of years ahead of time so growers get a chance to take a good look at new genetics before they commit fully. And so a big part of our lift in North America is that they went all in on a lot of that new technology this season."

This is another solid quarter across the board. Our",1067,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to give you my perspective on the second quarter and update you on our progress with our strategic plan as well as our merger with Dow. 
This is another solid quarter across the board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter of improvement as several of the metrics we watched most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. 
Highlights include: Organic sales grew, gross margin increased; operating cost declined; operating margins expanded across all reportable segments; and free cash flow and working capital improved. 
Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvements in our sales trend given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1%, excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses, and volumes grew in total by 2%. 
We continued to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating cost on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I'll speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. 
Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies and lower product cost. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines, or there are some type of disruption in global production. 
Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We are focused on executing well and continued to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these. 
First, we set a goal to beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost-savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost-savings commitments. One of the line items that we focus on is corporate cost, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lead core allows us to accelerate decision making to stay closer to our customers and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, giving business leaders more accountability for their overhead and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up. 
Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated given us strong confidence in the returns we can expect. 
The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting. And we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement is more than $200 million of that. Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet grower's needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like word building wrap and medical packaging. Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies like CRISPR-Cas gene editing to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term. 
Now I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone towards the combination of our 2 companies and the intended spin-offs into 3 industry-leading companies. In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect to close the transaction later this year. 
At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed top-level organizational structure. We have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction. 
In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees and keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses, while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick."

Continued strong execution on cost savings across",1084,"Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the second quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year, and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product cost and volume growth drove improvements in the quarter. Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions, except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio, in aggregate, negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to Slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continued to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. An increase in net after-tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $166 million with growth in margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs and as Ed mentioned, volume growth in 3 of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%. Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand partially offset by lower soybean volumes. Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later. Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters. Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass word and ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year. Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter primarily on cost savings. Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product cost in the quarter. Further details on segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses and lower CapEx in the second quarter. Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
In regards to share repurchases. We now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share. 
Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remain challenging. 
Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low single digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, our 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run-rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. 
In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in cost year-over-year. On an operating earnings basis, SG&A cost declined about $160 million, or 13%, primarily related to the G&A cost. Our corporate cost decreased 44%. 
The actions we outlined in December 2015 continued to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?"

Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions. Seed and Crop",917,"Thank you, Nick. Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. 
Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions. Seed and Crop Protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. We recognize that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014, and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months, and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined options. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance. Our sales in the first half were 2% lower as higher prices in corn volume gains more than offset by currency, lower soybean and Crop Protection volume and portfolio changes. 
In seeds, stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple point share gain in the competitive resilience Safrinha market. 
Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our word services remains high as growers begin to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our word offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than double last year's footprint. 
Now moving to our Crop Protection business. We were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. 
From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3% driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product cost and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%. 
Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. With our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine-tuning of our route-to-market. 
On the Crop Protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter. 
For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year, we had 2 large earnings benefits, totaling $48 million, associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs. 
We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year, and operating earnings to rise by the high single digits percent as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low teens percent. 
Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest. 
I will close with an update on the 3 priorities for Ag, namely: Delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans; ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio; and working with diligence on the merger with Dow. 
At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost-savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil. As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season, and one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer's history. These 2 successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology. 
And finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of 2 healthy innovative and highly complimentary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways. 
We had a good start to what has been a very active year in Agriculture, and we are excited about the progress that we're making. And I am confident that the team is focused on the right deliverables and will continue to execute in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

So let's just talk magnitude to get a sense of the impact it might have. This last earnings, it's likely we just came out, we talked about the remeasurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed, and the interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liabilities. So you can see, it's dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well. And everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash funding standpoint. And that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with the MAP 21 process that's used there. So it's not as dramatic an impact in any 1 year because of those interest rate changes as you would see from an accounting standpoint. We'll obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year, and that will be done, obviously, as we go forward with the merger and the spins as well."

We're looking at that market from a number of different angles. Credit is one area that when we constantly take a look at. We feel like we're not seeing any kind of Ag debt rates that are above anything that we would normally see, but we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is, because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half. As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model. And then we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So this is a real big change for us, it's a subtle change can be up 10 years. So and then we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in pass that really landed into second quarter, about $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And I would love to see an [indiscernible]. We had insecticide volumes and corn volumes. So you were right on momentum, we're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well. Clearly, one of the largest ramp ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps are actually -- will look pretty good too in the fourth quarter compared to last year when you think about what happened to that insect control market. So that explains how that sort of lines out."

Today, Intacta is commercialized, it's available to us, it allows us to practice in that technology. And then we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So we don't see those 2 technologies as competing. We see that over time, there is an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers. When you look at the seed treatment, the LaPorte, we see that as complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market. So on soybean share/volumes, clearly our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we have available to us, and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T-series launch that we talked a lot about, and we're approaching now this season about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer. So just the conversion, we're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward.

So we do have a team that's shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there, I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail, and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged, and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap on in contracts, but when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we have highlighted to you so far. So I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we can get some upsides to the plan. It will be awful nice to get it there because that's not headcount-related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So I'm highly confident that we're going to have at least a 3 [ph]. As I highlighted, this is really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we review with the merged -- merged co board as it really is a big part of the value creation, at least initially when we put these companies together. So I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely. I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant. And then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year which reduced our costs. So when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder, but still we're to be saving at $1 billion run rate exceeding your [indiscernible] to the $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year."

So we've got a lot of experience with that. At the same time, productivity is the name of the name of the game. And even in a tough market like this, growers will invest in crop to drive as many bushels off of those acres as they possibly can. So that's clearly a balance there. And we like the lineup of products that we have out there in the market, and we priced them right to deliver the right kind of value up for that. And we're always looking for other ways to deliver those type of products, whether it's through seed treatment and other key routes. So we've been here before.

Once we do the merge, our anticipation is there's very little of our cost-cutting, it's only going to be where there's really overlap on identical things in the R&D area. We obviously want to have the R&D. We especially wanted it in the Ag business. We want to be one of the top spenders, if not the top spender, in R&D in Ag, but we'll move some of that around to some of the new product areas that we can work instead of duplicating some efforts with Dow.

The majority of our Crop Protection price increases were aggressive actions that we took specifically to offset the negative impact of currency in Latin America. So as I said earlier, in the opening comments, we visited second quarter in a row where we've been able to fully offset the impact of that currency because we have it out there ahead of that. And then again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look of price. Some of that is mix and technology, and a lot of it has to do with the value that, that product delivers. And we differentially price our products in core markets, almost down to the ZIP Code levels. So you see a lot of differences in the way we position. Final aspect of price for us globally that it has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. I know we had a good view of it in the Safrinha season. This ramp up in the summer season is probably one of the largest ramp ups in our history, and where we're going to feel the benefits of that as well."

We always want to strive to do better. But just to give a little backdrop, the reason it feels better is we were plus 1% organically for the whole company. We were plus 2% on a volume basis. And the quarters before that, 4, 5 quarters before that, organically, we were kind of running a negative 2%, so we've seen a shift of about 3% which is not insignificant. So that should really be, I think, the key change there. But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is -- industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit maybe with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So we're kind of not running out of line any differently than anyone else. And about Europe, you were accurate on your points on it. Worldwide basis, our volume was up in North America, it was up in Latin America, it was up in Asia, and it was down some in Europe. So again, that was an improvement from where we have been running also. So we are not planning on this environment changing, we're planning on rest of '16 and '17 to be just kind of how the world is right now so we'll make smart decisions, and if things do improve for us, all the better for us, but we're not going to plan that way."

We didn't start that with everything else we had going on for a few months. And I actually feel good about it, the traction we have. So halfway through the year, our free cash flow is about $1 billion better [ph] year-over-year than last year. So that was a nice improvement. But what was nice, we've got some initial traction in working capital, about $200 million of that $1 billion improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side, and the receivables side, because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag, my God, is it just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we're -- we have programs, we're working on it. But -- so having said that, getting $200 million kind almost one quarter into the program or our $1 billion opportunity is pretty darn good. And again, over the intermediate period, I do think we're entitled to about $1 billion, maybe a little bit more of opportunity. But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now. And just like anything else, when you focus on it and spend time on it, you will get it fixed. And so it was nice to see the initial traction so far."

Today, I would like to give you my perspective on the second quarter and update you on our progress with our strategic plan as well as our merger with Dow. 
This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. 
Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter of improvement in several of the metrics we watch most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. 
Highlights include organic sales grew, gross margin increased, operating cost declined, operating margins expanded across all reportable segments and free cash flow and working capital improved. 
Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvement in our sales trend given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1% excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses, and volumes grew in total by 2%. 
We continue to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating cost on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I'll speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. 
Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies and lower product costs. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines or there are some type of disruption in global production. 
Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We're focused on executing well and continue to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these. 
First, we set a goal at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost-savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost-savings commitments. 
One of the line items that we focused on is corporate cost, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lean core allows us to accelerate decision making to stay closer to our customers and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, giving business leaders more accountability for their overhead and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up. 
Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated, giving us strong confidence in the returns we can expect. 
The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting, and we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement was more than $200 million of that. 
Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet grower's needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like Tyvek building wrap and medical packaging. 
Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies, like CRISPR-Cas gene editing, to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term. 
Now I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone toward the combination of our 2 companies and the intended spin-offs into 3 industry-leading companies. 
In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect to close the transaction later this year. 
At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed the top-level organizational structure. We have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction. 
In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees in keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick."

Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product cost and volume growth drove improvement in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions, except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio, in aggregate, negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to Slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. 
A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. 
A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. 
An increase in net after-tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $166 million with growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs and as Ed mentioned, volume growth in 3 of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%. 
Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand partially offset by lower soybean volumes.  Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters. 
Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass-through and ethylene prices, as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year. 
Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter, primarily on cost savings. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product cost in the quarter. 
Further details of segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects Agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses and lower CapEx in the second quarter. Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
In regards to share repurchases. We now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share. 
Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remain challenging. 
Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run-rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. 
In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in cost year-over-year. On an operating earnings basis, SG&A cost declined about $160 million or 13%, primarily related to the G&A cost. Our corporate cost decreased 44%. 
The actions we outlined in December 2015 continued to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?"

Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. 
Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions, seed and crop protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. 
We recognized that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014 and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months, and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined actions. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance. 
Our sales in the first half were 2% lower as higher prices and corn volume gain, more than offset by currency, lower soybean and crop protection volume and portfolio changes.
In seeds, stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple-point share gain in the competitive Brazilian Safrinha market. 
Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our Encirca services remains high as growers begin to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our Encirca offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than double last year's footprint. 
Now moving to our Crop Protection business. We were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. 
From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3% driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product costs and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%. 
Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. Within our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine-tuning of our route-to-market. 
On the Crop Protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third, driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter. 
For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year, we had 2 large earnings benefits totaling $48 million associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs. 
We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year and operating earnings to rise by the high single-digits percent as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low teens percent. 
Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest. 
I will close with an update on the 3 priorities for Ag, namely, delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans, ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio and working with diligence on the merger with Dow. 
At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost-savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil. 
As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season, in one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer history. These 2 successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology. 
And finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of 2 healthy innovative and highly complementary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways. 
We had a good start to what has been a very active year in Agriculture, and we are excited about the progress that we're making. And I'm confident that the team is focused on the right deliverables and will continue to execute in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

This last earnings, slightly here when we just came out, we talked about the remeasurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed. And the interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liabilities. So you can see its dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well. And everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash-funding standpoint. And that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with the MAP-21 process that's used there. So it's not as dramatic an impact in any 1 year because of those interest rate changes as you would see from an accounting standpoint. We'll obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year.

We're looking at that market from a number of different angles. Credit is one area that we constantly take a look at. We feel like we're not seeing any kind of Ag debt rates that are above anything that we would normally see, but we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half. As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model. And then we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So this is a real big change for us. It's a subtle change, could be $0.01 or so. And then we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in path that really landed into second quarter. About $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And that was mostly in Asia. We had insecticide volumes and corn volumes. So you're right on momentum. We're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well, clearly, one of the largest ramp ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps are actually -- will look pretty good too in the fourth quarter compared to last year when you think about what happened to that insect control market. So that explains how that sort of lines out."

So you're right, we just recently announced the Intacta license and the ability to introduce that product into the Brazilian market. The way I, first of all, look at it is I think about that technology opposite the discussions that we're having with Dow and the opportunity with Conkesta. Today, Intacta is commercialized. It's available to us. It allows us to practice in that technology. And then we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So we don't see those 2 technologies as competing. We see that over time, there's an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers. When you look at seed treatment, Dermacor, we see that as complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with other -- with Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market. So on soybean share/volumes, clearly, our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we had available to us, and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T Series launch that we talked a lot about, and we're approaching now this season about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T Series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer. So just the conversion, we're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward. And now we've got this full technology lineup, we'll see how things shape up in 2017 and beyond."

I think you're right, we got a crop in the ground that's looks really darn good, and it will put some downward pressure on corn commodity prices.

In fact, we're very far through the $1 billion cost reduction on a run-rate basis that we talked about for us this year. So yes, we're feeling very good about it. I wouldn't say my confidence is higher because of what we did this year. My confidence in the $3 billion of synergies on the DowDuPont merger are more because we now are digging line-by-line into all the detail. And as we mentioned earlier, we've identified 80% to 85% literally line by line of where the cost reductions are coming from to get us to at least the $3 billion. So we do have a team shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there. I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail, and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap when in contracts, but when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we've highlighted to you so far. So I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we could get some upside to the plan. It would be awful nice to get it there because that's not headcount-related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So I'm highly confident that we're going to have at least $3 billion. As I highlighted, this will really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we review with the merger -- mergeco board as it really is a big part of the unit value creation, at least initially, when we put these companies together. So no, I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember, the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely. I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant. And then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year, which reduced our costs. So when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder but still, we're to be saving at a $1 billion run rate exiting the year and get you the $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year."

The majority of our Crop Protection price increases were aggressive actions that we took specifically to offset the negative impact of currency in Latin America. So as I said earlier in the opening comments, we -- this is the second quarter in a row where we've been able to fully offset the impact of that currency because we have it out there ahead of it. And then again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look of price. Some of it is mix and technology, and a lot of it has to do with the value that, that product delivers. And we differentially price our products in core markets almost down to the ZIP code level. So you see a lot of differences in the way we position. Final aspect of price for us globally that has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. I know we had a good view of it in the Safrinha season. This ramp up in the summer season is probably one of the largest ramp ups in our history, and we're going to feel the benefits of that as well."

We always want to strive to do better. But just to give a little backdrop, the reason it feels better is we were plus 1% organically for the whole company. We were plus 2% on a volume basis. And the quarters before that, 4, 5 quarters before that organically, we were kind of running a negative 2%. So we've seen a shift of about 3%, which is not insignificant. So that should really be, I think, the key change there. But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is -- industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit mainly with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So we're kind of not running out of line any differently than anyone else. And by the way, you were accurate on your points. On a worldwide basis, our volume was up in North America. It was up in Latin America. It was up in Asia, and it was down some in Europe. So again, that was an improvement from where we have been running also. So we're not planning on this environment changing. We're planning our rest of '16 and '17 to be just kind of how the world lives right now, and so we'll make smart decisions.

So halfway through the year, our free cash flow is about $1 billion better year-over-year than last year. So that was nice improvement. But what was nice, we've got some initial traction out of the chute in working capital. About $200 million of that $1 billion improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side and the receivables side. Because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag, my gut is it's just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we're -- we have programs, we're working on it. But -- so having said that, I think getting $200 million kind of almost 1 quarter into the program on our $1 billion opportunity was pretty darn good. And again, over the intermediate period, I do think we're entitled to about $1 billion, maybe a little bit more of opportunity. But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now. And it's just like anything else, when you focus on it and spend time on it, you will get it fixed. And so it was nice to see the initial traction so far."

Dow will obviously stay with their SAP system and layer on our Performance Material business onto that fairly easily. But what we will then do when we get closer to spin is really start to work.

This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our",1070,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to give you my perspective on the second quarter and update you on our progress with our strategic plan as well as our merger with Dow. 
This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. 
Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment. In fact, this was the second consecutive quarter of improvement in several of the metrics we watch most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. 
Highlights include organic sales grew, gross margin increased, operating costs declined, operating margins expanded across all reportable segments and free cash flow and working capital improved. 
Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvement in our sales trend given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1% excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses, and volumes grew in total by 2%. 
We continued to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating costs on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I will speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. 
Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies and lower product costs. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines or there is some type of disruption in global production. 
Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We are focused on executing well and continuing to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these. 
First, we set a goal at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost savings commitments. 
One of the line items that we focus on is corporate costs, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lean core allows us to accelerate decision making to stay closer to our customers and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, given business leaders more accountability for their overhead and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up. 
Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated, giving us strong confidence in the returns we can expect. 
The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting, and we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement was more than $200 million of that. 
Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet grower's needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like Tyvek building wrap and medical packaging. 
Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies, like CRISPR-Cas gene editing, to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term. 
Now I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone toward the combination of our 2 companies and the intended spin-offs into 3 industry-leading companies. 
In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect to close the transaction later this year. 
At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed a top-level organizational structure. We have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction. 
In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees in keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick."

Continued strong execution on cost savings across a",1082,"Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the second quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product costs and volume growth drove improvement in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions, except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio, in aggregate, negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to Slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continued to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. 
A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. 
A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. 
An increase in net after-tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $166 million with growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs and, as Ed mentioned, volume growth in 3 of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%. 
Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand, partially offset by lower soybean volumes.  Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters. 
Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass-through and ethylene prices, as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year. 
Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter, primarily on cost savings. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product costs in the quarter. 
Further details on segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects Agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses and lower CapEx in the second quarter. Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
In regards to share repurchases. We now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share. 
Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remain challenging. 
Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run-rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. 
In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in costs year-over-year. On an operating earnings basis, SG&A costs declined about $160 million or 13%, primarily related to the G&A costs. Our corporate costs decreased 44%. 
The actions we outlined in December 2015 continue to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?"

Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. 
Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions, seed and crop protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. 
We recognized that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014 and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined actions. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance. 
Our sales in the first half were 2% lower as higher prices and corn volume gains, more than offset by currency, lower soybean and crop protection volume and portfolio changes.
In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple-point share gain in the competitive Brazilian Safrinha market. 
Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our Encirca services remains high as growers begin to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our Encirca offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than doubling last year's footprint. 
Now moving to our Crop Protection business. We were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. 
From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3% driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product costs and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%. 
Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. Within our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine-tuning of our route-to-market. 
On the Crop Protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third, driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter. 
For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year, we had 2 large earnings benefits totaling $48 million associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs. 
We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year and operating earnings to rise by the high single-digits percent as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low teens percent. 
Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest. 
I will close with an update on the 3 priorities for Ag, namely, delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans, ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio and working with diligence on the merger with Dow. 
At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost-savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil. 
As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season, in one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer history. These 2 successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology. 
And finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of 2 healthy innovative and highly complementary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways. 
We had a good start to what has been a very active year in Agriculture, and we are excited about the progress that we're making. And I'm confident that the team is focused on the right deliverables and will continue to execute in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

So let's just talk magnitude, so you can get a sense of the impact it might have. This last earnings cycle here when we just came out, we talked about the remeasurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed. And the interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liability. So you can see its dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well. Now everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash-funding standpoint. And that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with the MAP-21 process that's used there. So it's not as dramatic an impact in any 1 year because of those interest rate changes as you would see from an accounting standpoint. We'll obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year. And that will be done, obviously, as we go forward with the merger and the spins as well."

We're looking at that market from a number of different angles. Credit is one area that we constantly take a look at. We feel like we're not seeing any kind of bad debt rates that are above anything that you would normally see, but we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half. As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model. And we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So this is a real big change for us. It's a subtle change, it could be $0.01 or so. And then we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in the past that really landed into the second quarter. About $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And that was mostly in Asia. We had insecticide volumes and corn volume. So you're right on momentum. We're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well, clearly, one of the largest ramp ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps are actually -- will look pretty good, too, in the fourth quarter compared to last year when you think about what happened to that insect control market. So that explains how that sort of lines out."

It's available to us. It allows us to practice in that technology. And then we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So we don't see those 2 technologies as competing. We see that over time, there's an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers. When you look at seed treatment, Dermacor, we see that as complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with other -- with Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market. So on soybean share/volumes, clearly, our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we had available to us, and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T Series launch that we talked a lot about, and we're approaching now, this season, about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T Series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer. So just the conversion, we're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward.

You think about the year-over-year acre numbers that we saw, the USDA recently published USD [ph] acres. I think you're seeing some of those volumes consistent with those acre numbers. So overall, we'll see how it shakes out. But my view might also be that local, regional and some of the retail brands also had pretty strong performance this past year. So let's see."

When you then compare that to the second half of this year, we've essentially replaced our methomyl volumes from -- by sourcing from third parties. And then overall, that market is down a little bit. So the methomyl year-over-year is actually about a wash. Where the Crop Protection insect upside is coming from is really in Asia-Pacific. We saw the lead edge of that here in second quarter with the early onset of the monsoon and some favorable markets there. And then you know we continue to drive the volumes of Cyazypyr with those launches, and then our new fungicide, Zorvec, was also launched in Asia-Pacific. And all of those things really add up to those volumes in the second half."

In fact, we're very far through the $1 billion cost reduction on a run-rate basis that we talked about for us this year. So yes, we're feeling very good about it. I wouldn't say my confidence is higher because of what we did this year. My confidence in the $3 billion of synergies on the DowDuPont merger are more because we now are digging line-by-line into all the detail. And as we mentioned earlier, we've identified 80% to 85% literally line by line of where the cost reductions are coming from to get us to at least the $3 billion. So we do have a team shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there. I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail, and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap on in contracts, but when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we have highlighted to you so far. So I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we could get some upside to the plan. It would be awful nice to get it there because that's not headcount-related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So I'm highly confident that we're going to have at least the $3 billion. As I highlighted, this will really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we review with the merger -- the mergeco board as it really is a big part of the value creation, at least initially, when we put these companies together. So no, I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember, the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely. I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant. And then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year, which reduced our costs. So when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder but still, we're to be saving at a $1 billion run rate exiting the year and get you the $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year."

So we've got a lot of experience with that. At the same time, productivity is the name of the game. And even in a tough market like this, growers will invest in a crop to drive as many bushels off of those acres as they possibly can. So that's clearly a balance there.

On a percentage of sales basis, very similar also. Once we do the merge, our anticipation is there's very little of our cost-cutting. It's only going to be where there's really overlap on identical things in the R&D area. We obviously want to have the R&D. We especially want it in the Ag business, we want to be one of the top spenders, if not the top spender, in R&D in Ag. But we'll move some of that around to some other new product areas that we can work on now instead of duplicating some efforts with Dow.

So as I said earlier in the opening comments, we -- this is the second quarter in a row where we've been able to fully offset the impact of that currency because we have it out there ahead of it. And then again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look of price. Some of it is mix and technology, and a lot of it has to do with the value that, that product delivers. And we differentially price our products in core markets almost down to the ZIP code level. So you see a lot of differences in the way we position. Final aspect of price for us globally that has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. I know we had a good view of it in the Safrinha season.

But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is -- industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit, maybe, with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So we're kind of not running out a line any differently than anyone else. And by the way, you were accurate on your points. On a worldwide basis, our volume was up in North America. It was up in Latin America. It was up in Asia, and it was down some in Europe.

We didn't start that with everything else we had going on for a few months, and I actually feel good about it, the traction we have. So halfway through the year, our free cash flow is about $1 billion better year-over-year than last year. So that was a nice improvement. But what was nice, we got some initial traction out of the chute on working capital. About $200 million of that $1 billion improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side and the receivables side. Because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag, my gut is it's just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we're -- we have programs, we're working on it. But -- so having said that, I think getting $200 million kind of almost 1 quarter into the program on our $1 billion opportunity was pretty darn good. And again, over the intermediate period, I do think we're entitled to about $1 billion, maybe a little bit more of opportunity. But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now. And it's just like anything else, when you focus on it and spend time on it, you will get it fixed. And so it was nice to see the initial traction so far."

Dow will obviously stay with their SAP system and layer on our Performance Material business onto that fairly easily. But what we will then do when we get closer to spin is really start to work. But actually, DuPont had spent a lot of time on the latest SAP system and started an integration process then, and that's where we will get G&A savings when get to that point.

Today, I would like to give you my perspective on the second quarter and update you on our progress with our strategic plan as well as our merger with Dow. 
This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. 
Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment. In fact, this was the second consecutive quarter of improvement in several of the metrics we watch most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. 
Highlights include organic sales grew, gross margin increased, operating costs declined, operating margins expanded across all reportable segments and free cash flow and working capital improved. 
Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvement in our sales trend given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1% excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses, and volumes grew in total by 2%. 
We continued to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating costs on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I will speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. 
Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies and lower product costs. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines or there is some type of disruption in global production. 
Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We are focused on executing well and continuing to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these. 
First, we set a goal at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost savings commitments. 
One of the line items that we focus on is corporate costs, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lean core allows us to accelerate decision making to stay closer to our customers and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, given business leaders more accountability for their overhead and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up. 
Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated, giving us strong confidence in the returns we can expect. 
The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting, and we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement was more than $200 million of that. 
Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet grower's needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like Tyvek building wrap and medical packaging. 
Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies, like CRISPR-Cas gene editing, to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term. 
Now I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone toward the combination of our 2 companies and the intended spin-offs into 3 industry-leading companies. 
In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect to close the transaction later this year. 
At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed a top-level organizational structure. We have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction. 
In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees in keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick."

Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product costs and volume growth drove improvement in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions, except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio, in aggregate, negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to Slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continued to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. 
A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. 
A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. 
An increase in net after-tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $166 million with growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs and, as Ed mentioned, volume growth in 3 of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%. 
Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand, partially offset by lower soybean volumes.  Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters. 
Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass-through and ethylene prices, as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year. 
Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter, primarily on cost savings. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product costs in the quarter. 
Further details on segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects Agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses and lower CapEx in the second quarter. Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
In regards to share repurchases. We now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share. 
Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remain challenging. 
Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run-rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. 
In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in costs year-over-year. On an operating earnings basis, SG&A costs declined about $160 million or 13%, primarily related to the G&A costs. Our corporate costs decreased 44%. 
The actions we outlined in December 2015 continue to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?"

Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. 
Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions, seed and crop protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. 
We recognized that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014 and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined actions. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance. 
Our sales in the first half were 2% lower as higher prices and corn volume gains, more than offset by currency, lower soybean and crop protection volume and portfolio changes.
In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple-point share gain in the competitive Brazilian Safrinha market. 
Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our Encirca services remains high as growers begin to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our Encirca offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than doubling last year's footprint. 
Now moving to our Crop Protection business. We were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. 
From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3% driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product costs and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%. 
Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. Within our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine-tuning of our route-to-market. 
On the Crop Protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third, driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter. 
For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year, we had 2 large earnings benefits totaling $48 million associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs. 
We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year and operating earnings to rise by the high single-digits percent as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low teens percent. 
Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest. 
I will close with an update on the 3 priorities for Ag, namely, delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans, ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio and working with diligence on the merger with Dow. 
At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost-savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil. 
As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season, in one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer history. These 2 successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology. 
And finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of 2 healthy innovative and highly complementary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways.

So let's just talk magnitude, so you can get a sense of the impact it might have. This last earnings cycle here when we just came out, we talked about the remeasurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed. And the interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liability. So you can see its dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well. Now everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash-funding standpoint. And that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with the MAP-21 process that's used there. So it's not as dramatic an impact in any 1 year because of those interest rate changes as you would see from an accounting standpoint. We'll obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year. And that will be done, obviously, as we go forward with the merger and the spins as well."

We feel like we're not seeing any kind of bad debt rates that are above anything that you would normally see, but we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half. As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model. And we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So this is not a real big change for us. It's a subtle change, it could be $0.01 or so. And then we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in the past that really landed into the second quarter. About $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And that was mostly in Asia. We had insecticide volumes and corn volume. So you're right on momentum. We're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well, clearly, one of the largest ramp ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps are actually -- will look pretty good, too, in the fourth quarter compared to last year when you think about what happened to that insect control market.

So you're right, we just recently announced the Intacta license and the ability to introduce that product into the Brazilian market. The way I, first of all, look at it is I think about that technology opposite the discussions that we're having with Dow and the opportunity with Conkesta. Today, Intacta is commercialized. It's available to us. It allows us to practice in that technology. And then we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So we don't see those 2 technologies as competing. We see that over time, there's an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers. When you look at seed treatment, Dermacor, we see that as complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with other -- with Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market. So on soybean share/volumes, clearly, our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we had available to us, and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T Series launch that we talked a lot about, and we're approaching now, this season, about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T Series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer. So just the conversion, we're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward. And now we've got this full technology lineup, we'll see how things shape up in 2017 and beyond."

In fact, we're very far through the $1 billion cost reduction on a run-rate basis that we talked about for us this year. So yes, we're feeling very good about it. I wouldn't say my confidence is higher because of what we did this year. My confidence in the $3 billion of synergies on the DowDuPont merger are more because we now are digging line-by-line into all the detail. And as we mentioned earlier, we've identified 80% to 85% literally line by line of where the cost reductions are coming from to get us to at least the $3 billion. So we do have a team shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there. I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail, and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap on in contracts, but when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we have highlighted to you so far. So I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we could get some upside to the plan. It would be awful nice to get it there because that's not headcount-related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So I'm highly confident that we're going to have at least the $3 billion. As I highlighted, this will really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we review with the merger -- the mergeco board as it really is a big part of the value creation, at least initially, when we put these companies together. So no, I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember, the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely. I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant. And then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year, which reduced our costs. So when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder but still, we're to be saving at a $1 billion run rate exiting the year and get you the $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year."

You're right, it's always a possibility in a difficult market, like we're facing now and that we're heading into, that as a grower prioritizes the spend, clearly the focus on seed and get my equipment, my land rented, get all of my inputs and fertilizer paid for, that crop protection spend is usually the last dollar spent. So we've got a lot of experience with that. At the same time, productivity is the name of the game. And even in a tough market like this, growers will invest in a crop to drive as many bushels off of those acres as they possibly can. So that's clearly a balance there. And we like the lineup of products that we have out there in the market, and we price them right to deliver the right kind of value for that. And we're always looking for other ways to deliver those type of products, whether it's through seed treatment and other key routes. So we've been here before. We know how to operate in these markets, and we've got a good team that's heavily focused on it. Eyes wide-open, we're looking forward here to make sure that we're taking the steps right now today to continue to be competitive going into that 2017 mark."

The 2 years before that, it was just, as you mentioned, it was slightly higher, but the run rate historically has been kind of running right around that. On a percentage of sales basis, very similar also. Once we do the merge, our anticipation is there's very little of our cost-cutting. It's only going to be where there's really overlap on identical things in the R&D area. We obviously want to have the R&D. We especially want it in the Ag business, we want to be one of the top spenders, if not the top spender, in R&D in Ag. But we'll move some of that around to some other new product areas that we can work on now instead of duplicating some efforts with Dow. And I think that will be just great for the farm community and our farmers and our customers. There'll be more choice for them over the ensuing years if we get that right."

The majority of our Crop Protection price increases were aggressive actions that we took specifically to offset the negative impact of currency in Latin America. So as I said earlier in the opening comments, we -- this is the second quarter in a row where we've been able to fully offset the impact of that currency because we have it out there ahead of it. And then again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look of price. Some of it is mix and technology, and a lot of it has to do with the value that, that product delivers. And we differentially price our products in core markets almost down to the ZIP code level. So you see a lot of differences in the way we position. Final aspect of price for us globally that has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. I know we had a good view of it in the Safrinha season. This ramp up in the summer season is probably one of the largest ramp ups in our history, and we're really going to feel the benefits of that as well."

We always want to strive to do better. But just to give a little backdrop, the reason it feels better is we were plus 1% organically for the whole company. We were plus 2% on a volume basis. And the quarters before that, 4 or 5 quarters before that, organically, we were kind of running a negative 2%. So we've seen a shift of about 3%, which is not insignificant. So that's really the, I think, the key change there. But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is -- industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit, maybe, with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So we're kind of not running out a line any differently than anyone else. And by the way, you were accurate on your points. On a worldwide basis, our volume was up in North America. It was up in Latin America. It was up in Asia, and it was down some in Europe. So again, that was an improvement from where we had been running also. So we're not planning on this environment changing. We're planning our rest of '16 and '17 to be just kind of how the world is right now. And so we'll make smart decisions and if things do improve for us, all the better for us, but we're not going to plan that way."

So halfway through the year, our free cash flow is about $1 billion better year-over-year than last year. So that was a nice improvement. But what was nice, we got some initial traction out of the chute on working capital. About $200 million of that $1 billion improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side and the receivables side. Because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag, my gut is it's just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we're -- we have programs, we're working on it. But -- so having said that, I think getting $200 million kind of almost 1 quarter into the program on our $1 billion opportunity was pretty darn good.

But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now.

This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our",1070,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to give you my perspective on the second quarter and update you on our progress with our strategic plan as well as our merger with Dow. 
This was another solid quarter across-the-board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. 
Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment. In fact, this was the second consecutive quarter of improvement in several of the metrics we watch most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. 
Highlights include organic sales grew, gross margin increased, operating costs declined, operating margins expanded across all reportable segments and free cash flow and working capital improved. 
Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvement in our sales trend given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1% excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses, and volumes grew in total by 2%. 
We continued to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating costs on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I will speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. 
Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies and lower product costs. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines or there is some type of disruption in global production. 
Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We are focused on executing well and continuing to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these. 
First, we set a goal at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost savings commitments. 
One of the line items that we focus on is corporate costs, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lean core allows us to accelerate decision making to stay closer to our customers and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, given business leaders more accountability for their overhead and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up. 
Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated, giving us strong confidence in the returns we can expect. 
The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting, and we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement was more than $200 million of that. 
Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet grower's needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like Tyvek building wrap and medical packaging. 
Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies, like CRISPR-Cas gene editing, to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term. 
Now I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone toward the combination of our 2 companies and the intended spin-offs into 3 industry-leading companies. 
In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect to close the transaction later this year. 
At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed a top-level organizational structure. We have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction. 
In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees in keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Nick."

Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product costs and volume growth drove improvement in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions, except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio, in aggregate, negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year. 
Turning now to Slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continued to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. 
A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. 
A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. 
An increase in net after-tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $166 million with growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs and, as Ed mentioned, volume growth in 3 of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%. 
Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand, partially offset by lower soybean volumes.  Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters. 
Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass-through and ethylene prices, as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year. 
Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter, primarily on cost savings. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product costs in the quarter. 
Further details on segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects Agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses and lower CapEx in the second quarter. Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
In regards to share repurchases. We now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share. 
Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remain challenging. 
Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full year benefit of cost savings. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8, our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run-rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. 
In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in costs year-over-year. On an operating earnings basis, SG&A costs declined about $160 million or 13%, primarily related to the G&A costs. Our corporate costs decreased 44%. 
The actions we outlined in December 2015 continue to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?"

Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our 3 priorities for Ag. 
Agriculture markets continue to face challenges as farmers endure tough economic conditions, seed and crop protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. 
We recognized that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014 and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined actions. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance. 
Our sales in the first half were 2% lower as higher prices and corn volume gains, more than offset by currency, lower soybean and crop protection volume and portfolio changes.
In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple-point share gain in the competitive Brazilian Safrinha market. 
Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our Encirca services remains high as growers begin to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our Encirca offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than doubling last year's footprint. 
Now moving to our Crop Protection business. We were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. 
From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3% driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product costs and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%. 
Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. Within our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine-tuning of our route-to-market. 
On the Crop Protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third, driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter. 
For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year, we had 2 large earnings benefits totaling $48 million associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs. 
We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year and operating earnings to rise by the high single-digits percent as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low teens percent. 
Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest. 
I will close with an update on the 3 priorities for Ag, namely, delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans, ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio and working with diligence on the merger with Dow. 
At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost-savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I'm pleased with the strength of our pipeline as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil. 
As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season, in one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer history. These 2 successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology. 
And finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of 2 healthy innovative and highly complementary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways. 
We had a good start to what has been a very active year in Agriculture, and we are excited about the progress that we're making. And I'm confident that the team is focused on the right deliverables and will continue to execute in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Greg."

This last earnings cycle here when we just came out, we talked about the remeasurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed. And the interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liability. So you can see its dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well. Now everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash-funding standpoint. And that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with the MAP-21 process that's used there. So it's not as dramatic an impact in any 1 year because of those interest rate changes as you would see from an accounting standpoint. We'll obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year.

We're looking at that market from a number of different angles. Credit is one area that we constantly take a look at. We feel like we're not seeing any kind of bad debt rates that are above anything that you would normally see, but we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half. As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model. And we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So this is not a real big change for us. It's a subtle change, it could be $0.01 or so. And then we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in the past that really landed into the second quarter. About $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And that was mostly in Asia. We had insecticide volumes and corn volume. So you're right on momentum. We're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well, clearly, one of the largest ramp ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps are actually -- will look pretty good, too, in the fourth quarter compared to last year when you think about what happened to that insect control market. So that explains how that sort of lines out."

It's available to us. It allows us to practice in that technology. And then we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So we don't see those 2 technologies as competing. We see that over time, there's an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers. When you look at seed treatment, Dermacor, we see that as complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with other -- with Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market. So on soybean share/volumes, clearly, our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we had available to us, and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T Series launch that we talked a lot about, and we're approaching now, this season, about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T Series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer. So just the conversion, we're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward. And now we've got this full technology lineup, we'll see how things shape up in 2017 and beyond."

You actually got some pricing, which seems pretty impressive given what's happened in the commodity markets. So now we've got corn even lower. Do you worry you compromise the ability to get price going into next year? Is it possible, like back in the pre-biotech base, you could actually have new hybrids come out without a price lift? Or how do you sort of size up the market in light of this even more crimped farmer income situation?"

You're right, a lot of that price came from mix, and it's a tribute to the new technology that we had out there in the marketplace, especially in corn in North America that really led the way. And so when we think about pricing going forward, it clearly is a value equation. We price for value. We price for the genetic mix that we have out there. When you look forward to 2017, it's a little early right now to really be speculating on what that market looks like. I think you're right, we've got a crop in the ground that's looks really darn good, and it will put some downward pressure on corn commodity prices. And so when we think about our price launch here later this year, we kind of -- we take 2 or 3 factors into the equation: first, the technology lineup we have; second, the mix and the geographic lineup; and then third, the economic conditions that our customers are facing, and we'll price accordingly to the value that we're delivering."

We saw the lead edge of that here in second quarter with the early onset of the monsoon and some favorable markets there. And then you know we continue to drive the volumes of Cyazypyr with those launches, and then our new fungicide, Zorvec, was also launched in Asia-Pacific.

In fact, we're very far through the $1 billion cost reduction on a run-rate basis that we talked about for us this year. So yes, we're feeling very good about it. I wouldn't say my confidence is higher because of what we did this year. My confidence in the $3 billion of synergies on the DowDuPont merger are more because we now are digging line-by-line into all the detail. And as we mentioned earlier, we've identified 80% to 85% literally line by line of where the cost reductions are coming from to get us to at least the $3 billion. So we do have a team shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there. I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail, and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap on in contracts, but when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we have highlighted to you so far. So I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we could get some upside to the plan. It would be awful nice to get it there because that's not headcount-related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So I'm highly confident that we're going to have at least the $3 billion. As I highlighted, this will really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we review with the merger -- the mergeco board as it really is a big part of the value creation, at least initially, when we put these companies together. So no, I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember, the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely. I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant. And then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year, which reduced our costs. So when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder but still, we're to be saving at a $1 billion run rate exiting the year and get you the $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year."

On a percentage of sales basis, very similar also. Once we do the merge, our anticipation is there's very little of our cost-cutting. It's only going to be where there's really overlap on identical things in the R&D area. We obviously want to have the R&D. We especially want it in the Ag business, we want to be one of the top spenders, if not the top spender, in R&D in Ag.

And then again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look of price. Some of it is mix and technology, and a lot of it has to do with the value that, that product delivers. And we differentially price our products in core markets almost down to the ZIP code level. So you see a lot of differences in the way we position. Final aspect of price for us globally that has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. I know we had a good view of it in the Safrinha season.

We always want to strive to do better. But just to give a little backdrop, the reason it feels better is we were plus 1% organically for the whole company. We were plus 2% on a volume basis. And the quarters before that, 4 or 5 quarters before that, organically, we were kind of running a negative 2%. So we've seen a shift of about 3%, which is not insignificant. So that's really the, I think, the key change there. But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is -- industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit, maybe, with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So we're kind of not running out a line any differently than anyone else. And by the way, you were accurate on your points. On a worldwide basis, our volume was up in North America. It was up in Latin America. It was up in Asia, and it was down some in Europe.

We didn't start that with everything else we had going on for a few months, and I actually feel good about it, the traction we have. So halfway through the year, our free cash flow is about $1 billion better year-over-year than last year. So that was a nice improvement. But what was nice, we got some initial traction out of the chute on working capital. About $200 million of that $1 billion improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side and the receivables side. Because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag, my gut is it's just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we're -- we have programs, we're working on it. But -- so having said that, I think getting $200 million kind of almost 1 quarter into the program on our $1 billion opportunity was pretty darn good. And again, over the intermediate period, I do think we're entitled to about $1 billion, maybe a little bit more of opportunity. But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now. And it's just like anything else, when you focus on it and spend time on it, you will get it fixed. And so it was nice to see the initial traction so far."

Dow will obviously stay with their SAP system and layer on our Performance Material business onto that fairly easily. But what we will then do when we get closer to spin is really start to work. But actually, DuPont had spent a lot of time on the latest SAP system and started an integration process then, and that's where we will get G&A savings when get to that point.

Today, I'd like to give an update on our third quarter performance and the progress we are making with our 3 strategic priorities. We continued our first half momentum in the third quarter. Highlights were: Sales and volumes grew, gross margin improved, our operating cost declined, segment operating earnings increased, operating margins expanded in all reportable segment and free cash flow improved. 
Total sales increased 1%. Total volumes increased 3% despite a tough macroeconomic backdrop. 5 of the 6 reportable segments grew volumes. Performance Materials, Agriculture and Nutrition & Health contributed the most to the company's volume improvement. Drivers included strength in the global automotive market for Performance Materials, higher corn seed and soybean volumes and growth in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems for Nutrition & Health. 5% volume growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected strong demand for bioactives and biomaterials. Prices for the total company declined 2% partly due to the passthrough of lower raw material cost. 
Operating earnings totaled $0.34 per share, which was a significant improvement versus last year's $0.13 per share. Notably, all of our businesses contributed to the increase in segment operating earnings. While, our company-wide gross margins improved 45 basis points, the operating margin expansion in many segments largely came from our cost-savings program. Total operating cost declined by about $235 million for the quarter. All in, we are pleased with our financial performance. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating earnings per share to $3.25, a 17% increase from 2015. 
We also continue to make steady progress on our strategic priorities. As we have said, our strategic priorities for 2016 center on 3 drivers of shareholder value creation: Cost savings, capital expenditures and working capital. We set a target at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year end with a net reduction in costs of $730 million year-over-year. This quarter, we continue to deliver on that goal, and we are pleased with our progress to-date. We continue to project that 3 quarters of our cost savings for 2016 will come from SG&A. Our goal is to bring our cost structure to best-in-class levels, while continuing to fund investments for long-term growth. 
Keep in mind that we have a tough comparison coming up next quarter. There are 2 reasons for that. First, our $730 million target is a net year-over-year metric, and since began our cost-savings actions in the fourth quarter of last year, we're starting to lap our current leaner structure. Second, we expect compensation to be a headwind, including A recently announced merit increase for non-officer employees. The merit increase was effective on October 1. 
The capital expenditure plan for the year remains $1.1 billion, a 20% reduction versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. 
We have invested $759 million of capital year-to-date. We take a close look at all of our capital projects every quarter in our operating reviews, checking progress and assessing whether updated projections for returns continue to justify the spending. The projects we committed to are largely on track. 
Our third strategic priority is working capital. We have said we see an opportunity for a $1 billion reduction in working capital requirements over the medium term. We made further progress this quarter. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-to-date, led by reductions in working capital and capital expenditures. 
Meanwhile, our planned merger with Dow is progressing as expected. While, our interactions with regulators must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with authorities in all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals. We have made a lot of progress in helping regulators understand the dynamics of our industries in which we operate and demonstrating why our merger is procompetitive. We have provided all documents requested to date, and will continue to be highly responsive. 
Closing the merger is dependent on satisfying certain conditions, including receiving regulatory clearance from the United States, European Union, Brazil and China. We have made progress in all key jurisdictions and the event that regulators use their full allotted time, we would expect to close in the first quarter of 2017. However, we are very focused on working closely and constructively with all jurisdictions to receive those approvals as quickly as possible. We will be prepared to close the transaction once all the closing conditions have been met. 
Merger preparations in the third quarter focused on organizational design, finalizing the cost synergy plans and day 1 readiness. We have made good progress on all 3 fronts. We jointly completed plans for organizational design structures for the 3 businesses, and we expect to name the next layer of management for all 3 soon. 
A key priority of our overall organizational design is to continue to support the innovation that will be required to grow each of the businesses and the standalone companies we intend to create. We have also finalized our projects to deliver the targeted cost synergies. We will be prepared to begin implementing those projects soon after closing, with plans for phasing them in overtime in a way that protects business continuity. We have a high confidence level we will realize 70% of the savings on a run-rate basis by the end of the first 12 months after merger close, and 100% of the savings on a run-rate basis at the end of 24 months. 
Another significant effort throughout the third quarter and continuing today is around day 1 readiness. We will ensure we are fully functional on the first day of operations. At the same time, we continue preparations for the intend spend. 
Together with Dow, we need frequently to review the progress in all areas. Overall, we feel good about the pace of our progress our teams are making to close the merger, to realize the value creating synergies and position the intended standalone businesses for sustained growth over the long term. We will continue to update you on our progress. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick."
268053,380746083,1059887,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered operating earnings of $0.34 per share versus $0.13 per share in the prior year.

Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered operating earnings of $0.34 per share versus $0.13 per share in the prior year. The businesses continue to execute in a challenging macro environment delivering total company volume growth and cost segment improvements in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $4.9 billion increased 1% versus prior year. Total company volumes grew 3% led by a strong demand in Performance Materials, Agriculture, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences. From a regional perspective, demand was driven by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific. Local price negatively impacted sales by 2% in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in earnings contributing $0.15 to the quarter, including a $0.01 benefit from currency. We delivered growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement reflected continued execution on cost savings as well as volume growth in most of our segments. 
A lower tax rate benefited operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings. Lower corporate expenses added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis declined 25% versus prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. An increase in interest expense due to higher overall debt levels subtracted $0.01 per share from the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $174 million or 40%. Performance Materials operating earnings increased $54 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China. Operating margins in the segment expanded by about 350 basis points year-over-year. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $33 million. Volume growth of 4% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Operating margins in this segment improved 380 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 13 consecutive quarters. 
Industrial Biosciences operating earnings increased $17 million. Volume growth of 5% was driven by increased demand in bioactives and biomaterials due to growth in home and personal care and in the apparel market. Operating margins improved by 360 basis points in the quarter. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings in the quarter. 
Jim will speak to the Agriculture performance later, and I direct you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on the segment results. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion year-to-date reflected agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital and CapEx year-to-date. Working capital improved by about $400 million primarily due to business-driven actions, and lower tax payments contributed another $200 million. 
Our capital expenditures decreased by about $300 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvements in free cash flow. 
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Last week, we announced our 449th consecutive quarterly dividend, and in the third quarter, we completed $416 million in share repurchases resulting in the retirement of 6 million shares. 
As previously communicated, in regards to our 2016 share repurchase plan, we will not complete the full $2 billion stock buyback program by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of the repurchases continues to be dependent upon our trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window reopens shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to increase 17% versus prior year to $3.25 per share, and up from our previously communicated range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share. We now expect our base tax rate for the full year 2016 to be about 23%, representing a $0.07 per share headwind to operating earnings. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan, and an estimated headwind from currency of about $0.15 per share. We continue to expect sales to be down low single digits percent versus prior year and about flat with prior year when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Turning now to Slide 8. In the third quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges declined $235 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 14% decrease in cost year-over-year. Actual cost savings in the quarter were higher-than-expected due to a shift in the external R&D spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
SG&A cost declined about $150 million, or 15% with most of the decline related to G&A cost. Our current corporate costs decreased 25% in the quarter. Changes in variable compensation in both periods significantly impacted the year-over-year comparison. Excluding these changes, corporate cost expenses would have decreased by about 40%, in line with our results in the first half of 2016. As expected, in the fourth quarter, an increase in compensation as well as additional seasonal spending will result in a tougher comp year-over-year for operating expenses. However, we remain on track to deliver $730 million in cost savings in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim who'll provide an overview of the results for Ag."

Ag sales increased 2% and operating earnings for the quarter were a smaller seasonal loss of $189 million. Our solid performance was driven by a strong start to the Brazil summer season with our new Leptra hybrids continuing their successful launch. Favorable currency and cost savings also help drive the earnings improvement. 
Our third quarter volume increased 4% with growth in both corn and soybean seeds, that was partially offset by lower Crop Protection volumes due to the continued low pest pressure and high inventory in the industry. 
In Latin America, farmers chose a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulting in higher net corn price. The third quarter improvement in our seasonal operating earnings losses was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and a $28 million benefit from currency. It's important to note that the $21 million improvement came despite the absence of $48 million of one-time benefits, which were recorded in the third quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date, our Ag sales of $8.1 billion grew organically by 2% driven equally by volume and price. In corn seed, we have grown sales in 2016 by 4%, also driven by both volume and price improvements. This was enabled by building upon our leading positions in high-value global markets, including North America, Brazil, Mexico, southern Europe and South Africa. Our growth reflected the strong performance of our newest products and continued enhancements to our direct route-to-market. 
Our year-to-date segment operating earnings are up 5% driven by cost savings and favorable pricing, which provided us with the ability to overcome currency headwinds and weakness in the Crop Protection industry. 
So turning to our outlook for the final quarter of the year. We currently expect sales to be down in the mid-single digits percent range. We expect the seasonal operating earnings loss to be nearly half of what it was in the same quarter of last year. 
The fourth quarter outlook is pressured by timing in 2 respects. First, we are shifting seed deliveries from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2017 that's primarily driven by our southern route-to-market change to a sales agency model, which is similar to the approach that we utilized in the Midwest. And second, we realized sales in the third quarter to the detriment of the fourth quarter, primarily in Asia and Africa. 
The Ag industry continues to face tough conditions with challenging commodity prices leading to a further decline in net farmer income and high channel inventories. However, one thing remains clear, global demand continues to climb, which places an emphasis on innovation to drive productivity to meet farmers' financial goals and the needs of a growing population. We are helping to drive productivity through new product introductions such as our newest corn genetics, Leptra and Qrome corn products; our newest Crop Protection products such as Zorvec fungicide; and continued expansion of our Encirca services digital Ag offerings, which were on more than 2 million paid acres this year, more than twice last year. 
I will close with an update on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business. First, achieve our cost reductions and earnings commitments; second, deliver the new product pipeline; and third, plan for synergy delivery and ensure we're ready for the new Ag business. 
We are entering the home stretch of 2016 and are on target for both our cost-savings initiatives and our earnings plan. Advancements from our innovation portfolio are a key reason for our strong results. We continue to see favorable market reactions in Latin America to Leptra, which accounted for greater than 50% of our product mix in the Brazil summer season and drove overall price improvements in our year-to-date segment operating results. 
And finally, our integration planning activities continue to progress. During the third quarter, we made significant progress across key work streams. We've invested the time to ensure our readiness for the merger and planned the organizational structure. Now this is important work as we think about bringing 3 successful businesses together as DowDuPont to become 1 Ag division, with increased stability to innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for shareholders. 
We have finalized the plans to meet our commitment of $1.3 billion in cost synergies. While much of this work will continue to be refined as we approach and ultimately, close the merger, we are highly confident in meeting our overall commitments. 
As we look ahead, science, technology and consumer demand are rapidly changing the face of the industry. Today, offering unparalleled innovation to farmers and investing in new products is a requirement, not a choice. We continue to expect that the complementary combination of our portfolios will enable our R&D organizations to deliver growth through innovations that are above and beyond what our current standalone organizations could have delivered. Innovation will always be an imperative for our business. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Greg."

And we've got insect protected varieties and soybean is putting downward pressure on that and we're just going to need some time to work through those inventories, a little credit tightness to that market as well. I step back and look at North America, I would say, North America inventories are not an outlier. I think they're about where they ought to be at this part of the season going into 2017. And as we talked about before, I really like where DuPont's sits going into this market around, especially for Crop Protection in North America. We didn't play some of the things that happened in the marketplace late in 2Q and 3Q, and so I feel like we're sitting in a really good spot."

But when you go through each business, and let me take electronics first because electronics is our soft business on the sales line and price was down 1%, and we're just sitting in a tough consumer electronics market. It's over 30% of our portfolio in that business and hence, it's, by ways, the biggest part of the consumer market for us so. And that's been weak, and we're seeing that there. But if you take A lot of the other businesses, it's raw material pass-through in protection materials. It's just simply mix in Nutrition & Health, but we're working the mix to our advantage with the probiotics and the ingredients, so we feel good about that long term. And in Ag it was currency related. So everyone was a little bit different. So when I kind of look at the whole pricing because Nick and I have been studying this in the ops meetings, I don't see, across-the-board, price pressure per se on the businesses as we go into '17. It really is a bunch of different issues here. We probably still have some raw material pass-through in '17 but in general, I don't see that worsening. Hopefully, that improves just slightly."

I think there's opportunity above $3 billion. As you heard us in our prepared remarks, Jeff, we have locked down on all the programs we're allowed to be involved in pre-merger with Dow so we're ready to go in all the projects. The one area that we can't have final detail, let me say it that way, is on the procurement side because we can't compare contracts directly with our procurement teams. And as I've always said before in my past experience in life, having done this a few times, is that's where hopefully, we get some nice opportunity on the procurement side. We, and probably in our synergies, we've counted on certain number in the procurement area and when you look at it on a percentage basis or other deals, it is a little on the lighter side. So I hope we can really jump on that once the merger closes and see some opportunity there. But I'm very, very confident now because we locked down on the programs that we've got the $3 billion identified and we can move really quickly on the chute on that. And the only caveat I can say really quickly is we got to be careful in the Ag business of depending on where we are on the cycle and seasons, how we take the cost out. But having said that, that will play out over the first year also."

So we're in position to move really quickly when we need to. And probably just to this whole comment just to put it in perspective on the regulatory side, I remember we are first in line, I think even the EU commissioner commented on that, that we review things in the order that we get those in A recent statement. And I would also comment just to put this in perspective, sometimes we lose sight, we put Dow and DuPont Ag together, we're going to be a strong #2 in seed not a #1, the #2; and in Crop Protection, we're putting the #4 and the #5 player together to create the #3 player. And our goal obviously through that is to kind of increase innovation and capability to improve our pipeline and speed up our products both on the crop side and on the seed side. And we're very confident that we can do that. But I just kind of want to put that whole thing into perspective. No, I think we're right where we would think on the time line. We did have some delays as you all read with document submission on the EU side, that clock has restarted a few weeks ago and the outside gate that you saw, which is public was February 6.

When we did away with that, we did away with 3 parts -- there really was 3 parts to the matrix. One was in the R&D side where there was the central -- a fair amount of central R&D and we've embedded that almost now exclusively in the businesses. And by the way, when we get to mergeco and running the 3 divisions, it will all be embedded in the business. And I think that's a huge shift because we're very close to the customer with our R&D in this company, there's a ton of application engineering that goes on. And the closer we are with the R&D and the businesses, the closer we are with our customers, the quicker we're reiterating for them and innovating for them. So I think that was big for us. But I don't take lightly. I think what was really big for us was getting rid of the matrix, the global matrix and again embedding everything into the business. And then third area, which I think is going to have a huge payback and I think we're seeing some of it already, is we embedded all the manufacturing and the appropriate businesses, so the presidents, the P&L leaders have total accountability for every number in their business. And I also think that's helped us. As Nick mentioned earlier, we've driven very good working capital performance, very quickly this year, about $600 million so far in the year. And that's not by luck, that's by a lot of hard work. And I think reorganizing the way we did has helped us with that discipline."

And so, for instance, I mentioned earlier in Nutrition & Health, the mix of the businesses without spending more of our capital on the probiotic Ag side of the business, the cultures and the ingredients, they're the areas growing the fastest and that's at the expense of some of our other concentrates, textures and [indiscernible].

We had good, strong performance in our seed business making corn mainly in Latin America, as you heard Ed mentioned Leptra. We have a fairly strong finish to the North America selling season as well. And you're right, that was -- that performance in seeds was primarily offset by some weakness in our Crop Protection business, that was essentially due to Latin America for all the reasons we talked about, inventories, pest pressure and insect protected varieties. The rest of our quarter was really a timing story. We had some seed and crop sales that landed in third quarter to the detriment of fourth, that was primarily in Africa, these are just a timing things. So we've adjusted full year base on that. I know we had some timing and some cost that hit us in third quarter to the -- or we're not in third quarter to the detriment of fourth quarter, primarily write-downs from an inventory quality perspective, and then some cost tied to R&D contract timing. Now we pay for a lot of our field trials and contracts, sometime here towards the end of the year, it's so hard to call that timing so we have some benefits from the third that now we have those cost in fourth. So you're right, when we will look at 2017, I think like others, we're predicting a still a pretty challenging market as corn commodity prices continue to fall and soybeans a little bit unchanged. It's favoring the soy market, and we are seeing some volatility in pricing in both of those. We launched our programs here back in August, September and essentially our pricing structure was flat going into that season. And I think there's a real advantage of our route-to-market where we're actually sitting down with growers right now and having conversations with them even directly. It gives us good transparency around our pricing activities, it gives us good control of our inventories and things start to shift, we can adjust as the season unfolds. But it's still really early to call how 2017 is going to play out. But we're, as I said, essentially flat. We're going to play it really, really tight as we go into it."

And so we have a very project-by-project oriented approach, a very bottoms-up approach that essentially has confirmed that we have the target pretty much right. The way those costs have unfolded, we have a little bit that's focused in R&D and sales and marketing. We have some, as Ed mentioned, that are focused on our buy and the sourcing arena. And there's a fair amount that's really just tied to our production footprint, especially here in North America as we start to think about combining production assets both in seeds and Crop Protection. So I think maybe the confirmatory news, I wouldn't call it new news, is the synergies as very broad, they're across all aspects of the business and our teams are working really well together to develop a playbook that is very actionable on day 1."

So that's all going to be part of us, rebuilding share that we had continue to lose in soybeans. You did mention the bright spot for us has been corn in Brazil. We know that in the [indiscernible] season, we gain share based on a fantastic launch of Leptra and that momentum continued into the summer season still a little early with summer data still flowing in to call exactly what that share gain might be. But we know that we gained share in an expanding, growing market as well. So we feel really good about where we're positioned with how we held in North America with corn and how we're positioned to continue to capture growth in Latin America in corn."

I'd say by the way, during the third quarter, let me say, on the housing side, our Tyvek business actually had growth. So if you look at the Protection Solutions, the actual growth area came in Tyvek and came in the surfaces business with Corian and Zodiaq. So we saw nice demand on that side. Having said that, I mean it looks like all forecast say that housing is dropping off at least from a start standpoint, dropping of some in the 3-month window, or rolling window, July, August, September, looks like there was a decline of about 1.5%. So not significant, but it looks like there's a little bit of a rollover off of kind of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts, so you're kind of flat to down a little, so you might see a little bit there. And then on the auto side of the business, it looks like auto builds are going to be down in a couple of percent range going into next year. So that's a little bit of a drop from the 5% to 6% that we've kind of been running through the year. So you might see a little there. However, by the way, our demand still looks good for autos specifically in China on the Performance Materials side of the business. But we are modeling a little bit of a downdraft on those couple end markets."

So when you go back to my comments about mix, we're very focus on each business, where are these growth businesses, and where are we going to spend more money. We just, by the way, committed $82 million in our Nutrition & Health business on the CapEx side and we're putting it into our 2 highest growth platforms because we have great expansion opportunity there. And we're not putting a ton of capital on a couple of our more commoditized, just to give you an example. So that's what were working on very hard with our teams and I think that will pay off over the medium term for us on the volume side. Again, quarter-to-quarter, I don't know. But generally, I think we're working the right trend line here to help that so we can hopefully outperform some of these end markets that we have. Because at the end of the day, a lot of our stuff goes into industrial and markets beside the Ag and they're kind of flat like now. So we really need to work this mix and where the higher demand is."

And as we look globally, we saw some other country opportunities here and there. We've done some work in Eastern Europe and in Asia in the past and we'll continue to evaluate of those as the opportunities come up, and we have the resources available to invest. We know we got a good model every time we do make that change. We can point to the payback for those, it's just a matter of how many of those we can handle. As we think about the merger, the post-merger with Dow and bringing the Dow team in, I can tell you that there is some excitement about how do we take advantage of this -- to utilize this route market in certain geographies where today, Dow and some of their programs don't have the kind of the stability that we have.

Actually, you just saw reported the numbers over the last 2 weeks. So you kind of got to go specifically by all our businesses. But I think it's where we're putting some of our dollars and where we're focused in our end markets. We finally, as I did say in the third quarter, we did see some strength in the construction market, the Tyvek and services. We did some strength in Performance Materials on the auto side. But on the other hand, let me just give you another example on this whole mix thing. In Industrial Biosciences, our volume was up 5% in the quarter, and it was a lot of application work and product development with some of our big end customers. They really drove some of the business on our apparel side and our home and personal care side of the business and that's where we saw nice growth. So I think that's us introducing innovative products that are helping us drive some share and some opportunity. And again, that's what we haven't to keep doing that was intermediate period that's going to help us outperform the tough market on the volume side for all of us."

But the one area that Nick and I did not focus on last year and we're making it a big effort for '17 is our whole operation side of the house. We think there's really nice opportunity. As I say, every facility needs to prove what it in settlement is to be best-in-class it, and we have -- we have a couple hundred facilities, but there are 17 of them that are really large and really making A difference in DuPont. Some of those are very large, complex facilities with multiple product lines. And we're really going facility by facility to come up the entitlement is and then a program, A very disciplined program on how we start making improvements there. And I think tomorrow, or the next day, Nick and I are actually heading off to another one of our facilities, we're hitting them one by one. And, so I think that's another area, that will be the next interesting opportunity for us to streamline, to get more efficient and that's not only overhead the structure. That's really increased throughput through each facility, which allows us to run more on overhead structure and capital structure and that could be a big benefit for us."

During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements. I direct you to Slides 1 and 2 of our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliation to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides, which are posted on our website. 
Our agenda today will start with Ed providing his perspective on the company's performance and the advancement of our strategic initiatives, then Nick will review our third quarter financial results and 2016 guidance. Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take your questions. 
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed."

Highlights were sales and",1014,"Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to give an update on our third quarter performance and the progress we're making with our 3 strategic priorities. We continued our first half momentum in the third quarter. Highlights were sales and volumes grew, gross margins improved, our operating cost declined, segment operating earnings increased, operating margins expanded in all reportable segments and free cash flow improved. 
Total sales increased 1%. Total volumes increased 3% despite a tough macroeconomic backdrop. 5 of the 6 reportable segments grew volumes. Performance Materials, Agriculture and Nutrition & Health contributed the most to the company's volume improvement. Drivers included strength in the global automotive market for Performance Materials, higher corn seed and soybean volumes and growth in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems for Nutrition & Health. 5% volume growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected strong demand for bioactives and biomaterials. Prices for the total company declined 2% partly due to the pass-through of lower raw material cost. 
Operating earnings totaled $0.34 per share, which was a significant improvement versus last year's $0.13 per share. Notably, all of our businesses contributed to the increase in segment operating earnings. While our company-wide gross margins improved 45 basis points, the operating margin expansion in many segments largely came from our cost-savings program. Total operating cost declined by about $235 million for the quarter. 
All in, we are pleased with our financial performance. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating earnings per share to $3.25, a 17% increase from 2015. 
We also continue to make steady progress on our strategic priorities. As we have said, our strategic priorities for 2016 center on 3 drivers of shareholder value creation: cost savings, capital expenditures and working capital. 
We set a target at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end, with a net reduction in costs of $730 million year-over-year. This quarter, we continue to deliver on that goal, and we are pleased with our progress to date. We continue to project that 3/4 of our cost savings for 2016 will come from SG&A. Our goal is to bring our cost structure to best-in-class levels while continuing to fund investments for long-term growth. 
Keep in mind that we have a tough comparison coming up next quarter. There are 2 reasons for that. First, our $730 million target is a net year-over-year metric, and since we began our cost-saving actions in the fourth quarter of last year, we're starting to lap our current leaner structure. Second, we expect compensation to be a headwind, including a recently announced merit increase for nonofficer employees. The merit increase was effective on October 1. 
The capital expenditure plan for the year remains $1.1 billion, a 20% reduction versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. 
We have invested $759 million of capital year-to-date. We take a close look at all of our capital projects every quarter in our operating reviews, checking progress and assessing whether updated projections for returns continue to justify the spending. The projects we committed to are largely on track. 
Our third strategic priority is working capital. We have said we see an opportunity for a $1 billion reduction in working capital requirements over the medium term. We made further progress this quarter. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-to-date, led by reductions in working capital and capital expenditures. 
Meanwhile, our planned merger with Dow is progressing as expected. While our interactions with regulators must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with authorities in all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals. We have made a lot of progress in helping regulators understand the dynamics of our industries in which we operate and demonstrating why our merger is procompetitive. We have provided all documents requested to date and will continue to be highly responsive. 
Closing the merger is dependent on satisfying certain conditions, including receiving regulatory clearance from the United States, European Union, Brazil and China. We have made progress in all key jurisdictions. In the event that regulators use their full allotted time, we would expect to close in the first quarter of 2017. However, we are very focused on working closely and constructively with all jurisdictions to receive those approvals as quickly as possible. We will be prepared to close the transaction once all the closing conditions have been met. 
Merger preparations in the third quarter focused on organizational design, finalizing the cost synergy plans and day 1 readiness. We have made good progress on all 3 fronts. We jointly completed plans for organizational design structures for the 3 businesses, and we expect to name the next layer of management for all 3 soon. 
A key priority of our overall organizational design is to continue to support the innovation that will be required to grow each of the businesses and the standalone companies we intend to create. We have also finalized our projects to deliver the targeted cost synergies. We will be prepared to begin implementing those projects soon after closing, with plans for phasing them in over time in a way that protects business continuity. We have a high confidence level we will realize 70% of the savings on a run-rate basis by the end of the first 12 months after merger close and 100% of the savings on a run-rate basis at the end of 24 months. 
Another significant effort throughout the third quarter and continuing today is around day 1 readiness. We will ensure we are fully functional on the first day of operations. At the same time, we continue preparations for the intended spins.
Together with Dow, we need frequently to review the progress in all areas. Overall, we feel good about the pace of our progress our teams are making to close the merger, to realize the value-creating synergies and position the intended standalone businesses for sustained growth over the long term. We will continue to update you on our progress. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick."

Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered operating earnings of $0.34 per share versus $0.13 per share in the prior year. The businesses continue to execute in a challenging macro environment, delivering total company volume growth and cost segment improvements in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $4.9 billion increased 1% versus prior year. Total company volumes grew 3%, led by strong demand in Performance Materials, Agriculture, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences.  From a regional perspective, demand was driven by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific. 
Local price negatively impacted sales by 2% in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in earnings, contributing $0.15 to the quarter, including a $0.01 benefit from currency. We delivered growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement reflected continued execution on cost savings as well as volume growth in most of our segments. 
A lower tax rate benefited operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings. Lower corporate expenses added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis declined 25% versus prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. An increase in interest expense due to higher overall debt levels subtracted $0.01 per share from the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $174 million or 40%. Performance Materials operating earnings increased $54 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China. Operating margins in the segment expanded by about 350 basis points year-over-year. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $33 million. Volume growth of 4% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Operating margins in this segment improved 380 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 13 consecutive quarters. 
Industrial Bioscience operating earnings increased $17 million. Volume growth of 5% was driven by increased demand in bioactives and biomaterials due to growth in home and personal care and in the apparel market. Operating margins improved by 360 basis points in the quarter. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings in the quarter. 
Jim will speak to the Agriculture performance later, and I direct you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on the segment results.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion year-to-date reflected Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital and CapEx year-to-date. Working capital improved by about $400 million primarily due to business-driven actions, and lower tax payments contributed another $200 million. 
Our capital expenditures decreased by about $300 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Last week, we announced our 449th consecutive quarterly dividend, and in the third quarter, we completed $416 million in share repurchases resulting in the retirement of 6 million shares. 
As previously communicated, in regards to our 2016 share repurchase plan, we will not complete the full $2 billion stock buyback program by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of the repurchases continues to be dependent upon our trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window reopens shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to increase 17% versus prior year to $3.25 per share and up from our previously communicated range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share. We now expect our base tax rate for the full year 2016 to be about 23%, representing a $0.07 per share headwind to operating earnings. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and an estimated headwind from currency of about $0.15 per share. We continue to expect sales to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year and about flat with prior year when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Turning now to Slide 8. In the third quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges declined $235 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 14% decrease in costs year-over-year. Actual cost savings in the quarter were higher-than-expected due to a shift in external R&D spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
SG&A cost declined about $150 million or 15% with most of the decline related to G&A cost. Our current corporate costs decreased 25% in the quarter. Changes in variable compensation in both periods significantly impacted the year-over-year comparison. Excluding these changes, corporate cost expenses would have decreased by about 40%, in line with our results in the first half of 2016. As expected, in the fourth quarter, an increase in compensation as well as additional seasonal spending will result in a tougher comp year-over-year for operating expenses. However, we remain on track to deliver $730 million in cost savings in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim who'll provide an overview of the results for Ag."

I'll provide a review of our financial results and expectations for the fourth quarter, share our view on the latest market conditions and update you on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business. 
Against the backdrop of challenging market conditions, our Ag segment continues to execute well. For the third quarter in a row, we have delivered strong results. Ag sales increased 2% and operating earnings for the quarter were a smaller seasonal loss of $189 million. Our solid performance was driven by a strong start to the Brazil summer season with our new Leptra hybrids continuing their successful launch. Favorable currency and cost savings also helped drive the earnings improvement. 
Our third quarter volume increased 4% with growth in both corn and soybean seeds that was partially offset by lower Crop Protection volumes due to the continued low pest pressure and high inventory in the industry. 
In Latin America, farmers chose a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulting in higher net corn price. The third quarter improvement in our seasonal operating earnings losses was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and a $28 million benefit from currency. It's important to note that the $21 million improvement came despite the absence of $48 million of onetime benefits, which were recorded in the third quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date, our Ag sales of $8.1 billion grew organically by 2%, driven equally by volume and price. In corn seed, we have grown sales in 2016 by 4%, also driven by both volume and price improvements. This was enabled by building upon our leading positions in high-value global markets, including North America, Brazil, Mexico, Southern Europe and South Africa. Our growth reflected the strong performance of our newest products and continued enhancements to our direct route-to-market. 
Our year-to-date segment operating earnings are up 5%, driven by cost savings and favorable pricing, which provided us with the ability to overcome currency headwinds and weakness in the Crop Protection industry. 
So turning to our outlook for the final quarter of the year. We currently expect sales to be down in the mid-single-digits percent range. We expect the seasonal operating earnings loss to be nearly half of what it was in the same quarter of last year. 
The fourth quarter outlook is pressured by timing in 2 respects. First, we are shifting seed deliveries from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2017 that's primarily driven by our Southern route-to-market change to a sales agency model, which is similar to the approach that we utilized in the Midwest. And second, we realized sales in the third quarter to the detriment of the fourth quarter, primarily in Asia and Africa. 
The Ag industry continues to face tough conditions with challenging commodity prices leading to a further decline in net farmer income and high channel inventories. However, one thing remains clear, global demand continues to climb, which places an emphasis on innovation to drive productivity to meet farmers' financial goals and the needs of a growing population. We are helping to drive productivity through new product introductions, such as our newest corn genetics, Leptra and Qrome corn products; our newest Crop Protection products such as Zorvec fungicide; and continued expansion of our Encirca services digital Ag offerings, which were on more than 2 million paid acres this year, more than twice last year. 
I will close with an update on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business: first, achieve our cost reductions and earnings commitments; second, deliver the new product pipeline; and third, plan for synergy delivery and ensure we're ready for the new Ag business. 
We are entering the home stretch of 2016 and are on target for both our cost-savings initiatives and our earnings plan. Advancements from our innovation portfolio are a key reason for our strong results. We continue to see favorable market reactions in Latin America to Leptra, which accounted for greater than 50% of our product mix in the Brazil summer season and drove overall price improvements in our year-to-date segment operating results. 
And finally, our integration planning activities continue to progress. During the third quarter, we made significant progress across key work streams. We've invested the time to ensure our readiness for the merger and planned the organizational structure. Now this is important work as we think about bringing 3 successful businesses together as DowDuPont to become 1 Ag division, with increased ability to innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for shareholders. 
We have finalized the plans to meet our commitment of $1.3 billion in cost synergies. While much of this work will continue to be refined as we approach and ultimately close the merger, we are highly confident in meeting our overall commitments. 
As we look ahead, science, technology and consumer demand are rapidly changing the face of the industry. Today, offering unparalleled innovation to farmers and investing in new products is a requirement, not a choice. We continue to expect that the complementary combination of our portfolios will enable our R&D organizations to deliver growth through innovation that above and beyond what our current standalone organizations could have delivered. Innovation will always be an imperative for our business. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Greg."

But when you go through each business -- and let me take Electronics first because Electronics is our soft business on the sales line and price was down 1%, and it's -- we're just sitting in a tough consumer electronics market. It's over 30% of our portfolio in that business. And handsets, by way, is the biggest part of the consumer market for us so -- and that's been weak, and we're seeing that there. But if you take a lot of the other businesses, it's raw material pass-through in Protection, Materials. It's just simply mix in Nutrition & Health, but we're working the mix to our advantage with the probiotics and the ingredients, so I feel good about that long term. And in Ag, it was currency related. So everyone was a little bit different. So when I kind of look at the whole pricing because Nick and I have been studying this in the ops meetings, I don't see across-the-board price pressure per se on the businesses as we go into '17. It really is a bunch of different issues here. We probably still have some raw material pass-through in '17, but in general, I don't see that worsening. Hopefully, that improves just slightly."

As you heard us in our prepared remarks, Jeff, we have locked down on all the programs we're allowed to be involved in premerger with Dow so we're ready to go in all the projects. The one area that we can't have final detail on, let me say it that way, is on the procurement side because we can't compare contracts directly with our procurement teams. And as I've always said before, in my past experience in life, having done this a few times, is that's where hopefully we get some nice opportunity on the procurement side. But we -- and by the way, in our synergies, we've counted on certain number in the procurement area and my gut is when you look at it on a percentage basis of other deals, it is a little on the lighter side. So I hope we can really jump on that once the merger closes and see some opportunity there. But I'm very, very confident now because we locked down on the programs and we've got the $3 billion identified and we can move really quickly on, out of the chute on that. The only caveat I'd say to moving quickly is we got to be careful in the Ag business, depending where we are on the cycle and seasons, how we take the cost out. But having said that, that will play out over the first year also."

And I would also comment, just to put this in perspective, sometimes we lose sight, we put Dow and DuPont Ag together, we're going to be a strong #2 in seed, not a #1, the #2; and in Crop Protection, we're putting the #4 and the #5 player together to create a #3 player. And our goal obviously through that is to kind of increase innovation and capability to improve our pipeline and speed up our products both on the crop side and on the seed side so -- and we're very confident we could do that. But I just want to kind of put that whole thing into perspective. But no, I think we're right, where we would think on the time line, we did have some delays, as you all read, with document submission on the EU side. That clock has restarted a few weeks ago, and the outside gate that you saw, which is public, is February 6. So our comments today, we would therefore, close the merger in the first quarter of '17."

When we did away with that, we did away with 3 parts -- there really was 3 parts to the matrix. One was in the R&D side, where there was a central -- a fair amount of central R&D and we've embedded that almost now exclusively into the businesses. And that meant -- oh by the way, when we get to mergeco and running the 3 divisions, it will all be embedded in the business. And I think that's a huge shift because we're very close to the customer with our R&D in this company. There's a ton of application engineering that goes on, and the closer we are with the R&D in the businesses, the closer we are with our customers, the quicker we're iterating for them and innovating for them. So I think that was big for us, but I don't take lightly. I think what was really big for us was getting rid of the matrix, the global matrix, and again embedding everything into the business. And then the third area, which I think is going to have a huge,  huge payback, and I think we're seeing some of it already, is we embedded all the manufacturing in the appropriate businesses, so the Presidents, the P&L [ph] leaders have total accountability for every number in their business. And I also think that's helped us. As Nick mentioned earlier, we've driven very good working capital performance very quickly this year, about $600 million so far in the year. And that's not by luck, that's by a lot of hard work. And I think reorganizing the way we did has helped us with that discipline."

First of all, let's talk about the quarter for a moment. You did mention Ag. We had good, strong performance in our seed business, making corn mainly in Latin America; as you heard Ed mentioned, Leptra. We also had a fairly strong finish to the North America selling season as well. And you're right, that was -- that performance in seed was primarily offset by some weakness in our Crop Protection business that was essentially due to Latin America for all the reasons we talked about, inventories, pest pressure and insect protected varieties. The rest of our quarter was really a timing story. We had some crop protect -- some seed and crop sales that landed in third quarter to the detriment of fourth, and that was primarily an Africa issue, just a timing thing, so we've adjusted full year base on that. I know we had some timing at some costs that hit us in third quarter to the -- or what were not in third quarter to the detriment of fourth quarter, primarily write-downs from an inventory quality perspective and then some cost tied to R&D contract timing. We pay for a lot of our field trials and contracts sometime here towards the end of the year, and it's a little hard to call that timing so we have some benefits in third that now we have those costs in fourth. So you're right, when we look at 2017, I think like others, we're predicting still a pretty challenging market as corn commodity prices continue to fall and soybeans a little bit unchanged. It's favoring the soy market, and we are seeing some volatility in pricing in both of those. We launched our programs here back in August, September, and essentially our pricing structure was flat going into that season. And I think this is a real advantage of our route-to-market where we're actually sitting down with growers right now and having conversations with them directly. It gives us good transparency around our pricing activities. It gives us good control of our inventories, and things start to shift, we can adjust as the season unfolds. But it's still really early to call how 2017 is going to play out. We're, as I said, essentially flat, and we're going to play it really, really tight as we go into it."

The way those costs have unfolded, we have a little bit that's focused in R&D and sales and marketing. We have some, as Ed mentioned, that are focused on our buy and in the sourcing arena and also a fair amount that's really just tied to our production footprint, especially here in North America, as we start to think about combining production assets both in seed and Crop Protection. So I think maybe the confirmatory news, I wouldn't call it new news, is the synergies are very broad. They're across all aspects of the business, and our teams are working really well together to develop a playbook that is very actionable on day 1."

So that's all been a part of us, rebuilding share that we had continued to lose in soybeans. You did mention the real bright spot for us has been corn in Brazil. We know that in the safrinha season, we gain share based on a fantastic launch of Leptra and that momentum continued into the summer season, still a little early, with summer data still flowing in, to call exactly what that share gain might be, but we know that we gained share in an expanding, growing market as well.

So if you look at the Protection Solutions, the actual growth there is came in Tyvek and came in the surfaces business with Corian and Zodiaq. So we saw nice demand on that side. Having said that, I mean it looks like all forecasts say that housing is dropping off at least from a starts standpoint, dropping of some in the 3-month window or rolling window. July, August, September looks like there was a decline of about 1.5%. So not significant, but it looks like there's a little bit of a rollover off of kind of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts, so you're kind of flat to down a little, so you might see a little bit there. And then on the auto side of the business, it looks like auto builds are going to be down in a couple of percent range going into next year. So that's a little bit of a drop from the 5% to 6% that we've kind of been running through the year. So you might see a little there. However, by the way, our demand still looks good for autos specifically in China on the Performance Materials side of the business.

We just, by the way, committed $82 million in our Nutrition & Health business on the CapEx side and we're putting it into our 2 highest-growth platforms because we have great expansion opportunity there. And we're not putting a ton of capital on a couple of our more commoditized, just to give you an example.

In Industrial Biosciences, our volume was up 5% in the quarter, and it was a lot of application work and product development with some of our big end customers.

We've been spending a lot of time the last couple of months really in the one area that we had not focused on, and I say not  -- our teams are obviously focused, but Nick and I have been spending time. So what we did, we've been looking at volumes as we're talking about in this mix shift. We're looking obviously to cost-structure the company. We've got rid of the matrix organization. We're really focused on where our R&D is going to drive results. But the one area that Nick and I did not focus on last year and we're making it a big effort for '17 is our whole operation side of the house. We think there's really nice opportunity. As I say, every facility needs to prove what its entitlement is to be best-in-class, and we have -- in fact, we have a couple hundred facilities, but there 17 of them that are really large and really making a difference in DuPont. And some of those are very large, complex facilities with multiple product lines, and we're really going facility by facility to come up what the entitlement is and then a program, a very disciplined program on how we start making improvements there. And I think tomorrow or the next day, Nick and I are actually heading out to another one of our facilities. We're hitting them one by one. And so I think that's another area that will be the next interesting opportunity for us to streamline and get more efficient. And that's not only overhead structure. That's really increased throughput through each facility, which allows us to run more on the same overhead structure and capital structure, and that could be a big benefit for us."

Today, I'd like to give an update on our third quarter performance and the progress we are making with our 3 strategic priorities. We continued our first half momentum in the third quarter. Highlights were sales and volumes grew, gross margins improved, our operating costs declined, segment operating earnings increased, operating margins expanded in all reportable segments and free cash flow improved. 
Total sales increased 1%. Total volumes increased 3% despite a tough macroeconomic backdrop. 5 of the 6 reportable segments grew volumes. Performance Materials, Agriculture and Nutrition & Health contributed the most to the company's volume improvement. Drivers included strength in the global automotive market for Performance Materials, higher corn seed and soybean volumes and growth in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems for Nutrition & Health. 5% volume growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected strong demand for bioactives and biomaterials. Prices for the total company declined 2% partly due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings totaled $0.34 per share, which was a significant improvement versus last year's $0.13 per share. Notably, all of our businesses contributed to the increase in segment operating earnings. While our company-wide gross margins improved 45 basis points, the operating margin expansion in many segments largely came from our cost-savings program. Total operating costs declined by about $235 million for the quarter. 
All in, we are pleased with our financial performance. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating earnings per share to $3.25, a 17% increase from 2015. 
We also continue to make steady progress on our strategic priorities. As we have said, our strategic priorities for 2016 center on 3 drivers of shareholder value creation: cost savings, capital expenditures and working capital. 
We set a target at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end, with a net reduction in costs of $730 million year-over-year. This quarter, we continued to deliver on that goal, and we are pleased with our progress to date. We continue to project that 3/4 of our cost savings for 2016 will come from SG&A. Our goal is to bring our cost structure to best-in-class levels while continuing to fund investments for long-term growth. 
Keep in mind that we have a tough comparison coming up next quarter. There are 2 reasons for that. First, our $730 million target is a net year-over-year metric, and since we began our cost-saving actions in the fourth quarter of last year, we're starting to lap our current leaner structure. Second, we expect compensation to be a headwind, including a recently announced merit increase for non-officer employees. The merit increase was effective on October 1. 
The capital expenditure plan for the year remains $1.1 billion, a 20% reduction versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. 
We have invested $759 million of capital year-to-date. We take a close look at all of our capital projects every quarter in our operating reviews, checking progress and assessing whether updated projections for returns continue to justify the spending. The projects we committed to are largely on track. 
Our third strategic priority is working capital. We have said we see an opportunity for a $1 billion reduction in working capital requirements over the medium term. We made further progress this quarter. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-to-date, led by reductions in working capital and capital expenditures. 
Meanwhile, our planned merger with Dow is progressing as expected. While our interactions with regulators must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with authorities in all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals. We have made a lot of progress in helping regulators understand the dynamics of our industries in which we operate and demonstrating why our merger is procompetitive. We have provided all documents requested to date and will continue to be highly responsive. 
Closing the merger is dependent on satisfying certain conditions, including receiving regulatory clearance from the United States, European Union, Brazil and China. We have made progress in all key jurisdictions. In the event that regulators use their full allotted time, we would expect to close in the first quarter of 2017. However, we are very focused on working closely and constructively with all jurisdictions to receive those approvals as quickly as possible. We will be prepared to close the transaction once all the closing conditions have been met. 
Merger preparations in the third quarter focused on organizational design, finalizing the cost synergy plans and day 1 readiness. We have made good progress on all 3 fronts. We jointly completed plans for organizational design structures for the 3 businesses, and we expect to name the next layer of management for all 3 soon. 
A key priority of our overall organizational design is to continue to support the innovation that will be required to grow each of the businesses and the standalone companies that we intend to create. We have also finalized our projects to deliver the targeted cost synergies. We will be prepared to begin implementing those projects soon after closing, with plans for phasing them in over time in a way that protects business continuity. We have a high confidence level we will realize 70% of the savings on a run-rate basis by the end of the first 12 months after merger close and 100% of the savings on a run-rate basis at the end of 24 months. 
Another significant effort throughout the third quarter and continuing today is around day 1 readiness. We will ensure we are fully functional on the first day of operations. At the same time, we continue preparations for the intended spins.
Together with Dow, we need frequently to review the progress in all areas. Overall, we feel good about the pace of our progress our teams are making to close the merger, to realize the value-creating synergies and position the intended standalone businesses for sustained growth over the long term. We will continue to update you on our progress. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick."

Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered operating earnings of $0.34 per share versus $0.13 per share in the prior year. The businesses continue to execute in a challenging macro environment, delivering total company volume growth and cost savings improvements in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $4.9 billion increased 1% versus prior year. Total company volumes grew 3%, led by strong demand in Performance Materials, Agriculture, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences.  From a regional perspective, demand was driven by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific. 
Local price negatively impacted sales by 2% in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in earnings, contributing $0.15 to the quarter, including a $0.01 benefit from currency. We delivered growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement reflected continued execution on cost savings as well as volume growth in most of our segments. 
A lower tax rate benefited operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings. Lower corporate expenses added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis declined 25% versus prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. An increase in interest expense due to higher overall debt levels subtracted $0.01 per share from the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $174 million or 40%. Performance Materials operating earnings increased $54 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China. Operating margins in the segment expanded by about 350 basis points year-over-year. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $33 million. Volume growth of 4% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Operating margins in this segment improved 380 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 13 consecutive quarters. 
Industrial Bioscience operating earnings increased $17 million. Volume growth of 5% was driven by increased demand in bioactives and biomaterials due to growth in home and personal care and in the apparel market. Operating margins improved by 360 basis points in the quarter. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings in the quarter. 
Jim will speak to the Agricultural performance later, and I direct you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on the segment results.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion year-to-date reflected Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital and CapEx year-to-date. Working capital improved by about $400 million primarily due to business-driven actions, and lower tax payments contributed another $200 million. 
Our capital expenditures decreased by about $300 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Last week, we announced our 449th consecutive quarterly dividend, and in the third quarter, we completed $416 million in share repurchases resulting in the retirement of 6 million shares. 
As previously communicated, in regards to our 2016 share repurchase plan, we will not complete the full $2 billion stock buyback program by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of the repurchases continues to be dependent upon our trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window reopens shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to increase 17% versus prior year to $3.25 per share and up from our previously communicated range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share. We now expect our base tax rate for the full year 2016 to be about 23%, representing a $0.07 per share headwind to operating earnings. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and an estimated headwind from currency of about $0.15 per share. We continue to expect sales to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year and about flat with prior year when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Turning now to Slide 8. In the third quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges declined $235 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 14% decrease in costs year-over-year. Actual cost savings in the quarter were higher-than-expected due to a shift in external R&D spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
SG&A costs declined about $150 million or 15% with most of the decline related to G&A cost. Our current corporate costs decreased 25% in the quarter. Changes in variable compensation in both periods significantly impacted the year-over-year comparison. Excluding these changes, corporate costs expenses would have decreased by about 40%, in line with our results in the first half of 2016. As expected, in the fourth quarter, an increase in compensation as well as additional seasonal spending will result in a tougher comp year-over-year for operating expenses. However, we remain on track to deliver $730 million in cost savings in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim who will provide an overview of the results for Ag."

I'll provide a review of our financial results and expectations for the fourth quarter, share our view on the latest market conditions and update you on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business. Against a backdrop of challenging mark",877,"Thanks, Nick. I'll provide a review of our financial results and expectations for the fourth quarter, share our view on the latest market conditions and update you on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business. 
Against a backdrop of challenging market conditions, our Ag segment continues to execute well. For the third quarter in a row, we have delivered strong results. Ag sales increased 2% and operating earnings for the quarter were a smaller seasonal loss of $189 million. Our solid performance was driven by a strong start to the Brazil summer season with our new Leptra hybrids continuing their successful launch. Favorable currency and cost savings also helped drive the earnings improvement. 
Our third quarter volume increased 4% with growth in both corn and soybean seeds that was partially offset by lower Crop Protection volumes due to the continued low pest pressure and high inventory in the industry. 
In Latin America, farmers chose a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulting in higher net corn price. The third quarter improvement in our seasonal operating earnings losses was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and a $28 million benefit from currency. It's important to note that the $21 million improvement came despite the absence of $48 million of onetime benefits, which were recorded in the third quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date, our Ag sales of $8.1 billion grew organically by 2%, driven equally by volume and price. In corn seed, we have grown sales in 2016 by 4%, also driven by both volume and price improvements. This was enabled by building upon our leading positions in high-value global markets, including North America, Brazil, Mexico, Southern Europe and South Africa. Our growth reflected the strong performance of our newest products and continued enhancements to our direct route-to-market. 
Our year-to-date segment operating earnings are up 5%, driven by cost savings and favorable pricing, which provided us with the ability to overcome currency headwinds and weakness in the Crop Protection industry. 
So turning to our outlook for the final quarter of the year. We currently expect sales to be down in the mid-single-digits percent range. We expect the seasonal operating earnings loss to be nearly half of what it was in the same quarter of last year. 
The fourth quarter outlook is pressured by timing in 2 respects. First, we are shifting seed deliveries from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2017. That's primarily driven by our Southern route-to-market change to a sales agency model, which is similar to the approach that we utilize in the Midwest. And second, we realized sales in the third quarter to the detriment of the fourth quarter, primarily in Asia and Africa. 
The Ag industry continues to face tough conditions with challenging commodity prices leading to a further decline in net farmer income and high channel inventories. However, one thing remains clear, global demand continues to climb, which places an emphasis on innovation to drive productivity to meet farmers' financial goals and the needs of a growing population. We are helping to drive productivity through new product introductions, such as our newest corn genetics, Leptra and Qrome corn products; our newest Crop Protection products such as Zorvec fungicide; and continued expansion of our Encirca services digital Ag offerings, which were on more than 2 million paid acres this year, more than twice last year. 
I will close with an update on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business: first, achieve our cost reductions and earnings commitments; second, deliver the new product pipeline; and third, plan for synergy delivery and ensure we're ready for the new Ag business. 
We are entering the home stretch of 2016 and are on target for both our cost-savings initiatives and our earnings plan. Advancements from our innovation portfolio are a key reason for our strong results. We continue to see favorable market reactions in Latin America to Leptra, which accounted for greater than 50% of our product mix in the Brazil summer season and drove overall price improvements in our year-to-date segment operating results. 
And finally, our integration planning activities continued to progress. During the third quarter, we made significant progress across key work streams. We have invested the time to ensure our readiness for the merger and plan the organizational structure. Now this is important work as we think about bringing 3 successful businesses together as DowDuPont to become 1 Ag division, with increased ability to innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for shareholders. 
We have finalized the plans to meet our commitment of $1.3 billion in cost synergies. While much of this work will continue to be refined as we approach and, ultimately, close the merger, we are highly confident in meeting our overall commitments. 
As we look ahead, science, technology and consumer demand are rapidly changing the face of the industry. Today, offering unparalleled innovation to farmers and investing in new products is a requirement, not a choice. We continue to expect that the complementary combination of our portfolios will enable our R&D organizations to deliver growth through innovation that's above and beyond what our current standalone organizations could have delivered. Innovation will always be an imperative for our business. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Greg."

When I step back and look at North America, I would say North America inventories are not an outlier. I think they're about where they ought to be at this part of the season going into 2017. And as we talked about before, I really like where DuPont sits going into this market around -- especially for Crop Protection in North America.

But when you go through each business -- and let me take Electronics first because Electronics is our soft business on the sales line and price was down 1%, and it's -- we're just sitting in a tough consumer electronics market. It's over 30% of our portfolio in that business. And handsets, by way, is the biggest part of the consumer market for us so -- and that's been weak, and we're seeing that there. But if you take a lot of the other businesses, it's raw material pass-through in Protection, Materials. It's just simply mix in Nutrition & Health, but we're working the mix to our advantage with the probiotics and the ingredients, so I feel good about that long term. And in Ag, it was currency related. So everyone was a little bit different. So when I kind of look at the whole pricing, because Nick and I have been studying this in the ops meetings, I don't see across-the-board price pressure per se on the businesses as we go into '17. It really is a bunch of different issues here. We probably still will have some raw material pass-through in '17, but in general, I don't see that worsening. Hopefully, that improves just slightly."

As you heard us in our prepared remarks, Jeff, we have locked down on all the programs we're allowed to be involved in, premerger, with Dow so we're ready to go in all the projects. The one area that we can't have final detail on, let me say it that way, is on the procurement side because we can't compare contracts directly with our procurement teams. And as I've always said before, in my past experience in life, having done this a few times, is that's where hopefully we get some nice opportunity on the procurement side. We -- and probably in our synergies, we've counted on a certain number in the procurement area and my gut is when you look at it on a percentage basis of other deals, it is a little on the lighter side. So I hope we can really jump on that once the merger closes and see some opportunity there. But I'm very, very confident now because we've locked down on the programs and we've got the $3 billion identified and we can move really quickly out of the chute on that. The only caveat I'd say to moving quickly is we've got to be careful in the Ag business, depending where we are in the cycle with the seasons, how we take the cost out. But having said that, that will play out over the first year also."

And probably just this whole comment, just to put it in perspective on the regulatory side, remember we are first in line. I think even the EU commissioner commented on that, that we review things in the order that we get those in a recent statement. And I would also comment, just to put this in perspective, I think sometimes we lose sight, when we put Dow and DuPont Ag together, we're going to be a strong #2 in seed, not a #1, the #2; and in Crop Protection, we're putting the #4 and the #5 player together to create a #3 player. And our goal obviously through that is to have increased innovation and capability to improve our pipeline and speed up our products both on the crop side and on the seed side so -- and we're very confident we can do that. But I just want to kind of put that whole thing into perspective. But no, I think we're right where we would think on the time line, we did have some delay, as you all read, with document submission on the EU side. That clock has restarted a few weeks ago, and the outside gate that you saw, which is public, is February 6.

When we did away with that, we did away with 3 parts -- there really was 3 parts to the matrix. One was in the R&D side, where there was a central -- a fair amount of central R&D and we've embedded that almost now exclusively into the businesses. And oh, by the way, when we get to mergeco and running the 3 divisions, it will all be embedded in the business. And I think that's a huge shift because we're very close to the customer with our R&D in this company. There's a ton of application engineering that goes on, and the closer we are with the R&D in the businesses, the closer we are with our customers, the quicker we're iterating for them and innovating for them. So I think that was big for us, but I don't take lightly. I think what was really big for us was getting rid of the matrix, the global matrix, and again embedding everything into the business. And then the third area, which I think is going to have a huge, huge payback, and I think we're seeing some of it already, is we embedded all the manufacturing in the appropriate businesses, so the Presidents, the P&L leaders have total accountability for every number in their business. And I also think that's helped us. As Nick mentioned earlier, we've driven very good working capital performance very quickly this year, about $600 million so far in the year.

And then what -- we have a big focus in the company on mix enrichment because that's really what's going to drive our gross margin improvement. And so, for instance, as I mentioned earlier, in Nutrition & Health, the mix of the businesses, with us spending more of our capital on the probiotic Ag side of the business, the cultures and the ingredients, they're the areas growing the fastest and that's at the expense of some of our other concentrates, texturants, and also, we're really working mix -- and probably, in Ag, Jim can comment, it's a lot of new product launches like Leptra [ph], which we're getting better pricing, better mix.

We had good, strong performance in our seed business in corn, mainly in Latin America, as you heard Ed mention, Leptra. And we actually had a fairly strong finish to the North America selling season as well. And you're right, that was -- that performance in seed was primarily offset by some weakness in our Crop Protection business that was essentially due to Latin America for all the reasons we talked about: inventories, pest pressure and insect protected varieties. The rest of our quarter was really a timing story. We had some crop protect -- some seed and crop sales that landed in third quarter to the detriment of fourth, and that was primarily in Africa and Asia, just a timing thing, so we've adjusted full year based on that. And then we had some timing of some costs that hit us in third quarter to the -- or what were not in third quarter to the detriment of fourth quarter, primarily write-downs from an inventory quality perspective and then some costs tied to R&D contract timing. We pay for a lot of our field trials and contracts sometime here towards the end of the year, and it's a little hard to call that timing, so we had some benefits in third that now we have those costs in fourth. So you're right, when we look at 2017, I think like others, we're predicting still a pretty challenging market as corn commodity prices continue to fall and soybeans a little bit unchanged. It's favoring the soy market, and we are seeing some volatility in pricing in both of those. We launched our programs here back in August, September, and essentially our pricing structure was flat going into that season. And I think this is a real advantage of our route-to-market where we're actually sitting down with growers right now and having conversations with them directly. It gives us good transparency around our pricing activities. It gives us good control of our inventories, and if things start to shift, we can adjust as the season unfolds. But it's still really early to call how 2017 is going to play out. But we're, as I said, essentially flat, and we're going to play it really, really tight as we go into it."

If I use the latest October USDA acreage estimate, we're calling our market share in corn North America essentially flat. And you're right, in soybeans, both in North America and in Brazil, we've been working on turning over that germplasm base with the new varieties, our T Series varieties, getting access to traits in Brazil like Intacta going forward. So that's all been a part of us rebuilding share that we had continued to lose in soybeans. You did mention the real bright spot for us has been corn in Brazil. We know that in the safrinha season, we gained share based on a fantastic launch of Leptra and that momentum continued into the summer season, still a little early, with summer data still flowing in, to call exactly what that share gain might be, but we know that we gained share in an expanding, growing market as well. So we feel really good about where we're positioned with -- how we held in North America with corn and how we're positioned to continue to capture growth in Latin America in corn."

I'd say by the way, our -- during the third quarter, let me say, our -- on the housing side, our Tyvek business actually had growth. So if you look at the Protection Solutions, the actual growth areas came in Tyvek and came in the surfaces business with Corian and Zodiaq. So we saw nice demand on that side. Having said that, I mean it looks like all forecasts say that housing is dropping off at least from a start standpoint, dropping of some in the 3-month window or rolling window. July, August, September looks like there was a decline of about 1.5%. So not significant, but it looks like there's a little bit of a rollover off of kind of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts, so kind of flat to down a little, so you might see a little bit there. And then on the auto side of the business, it looks like auto builds are going to be down in the couple percent range going into next year. So that's a little bit of a drop from the 5% to 6% that we've kind of been running through the year. So you might see a little there. However, by the way, our demand still looks good for autos, specifically in China, on the Performance Materials side of the business. But we are modeling a little bit of a downdraft in those couple end markets."

As I mentioned before, we're really working on -- very hard on the innovation side and on our spending and on our capital side, is where is the larger growth opportunities. So when you go back to my comments about mix, we're very focused in each business on where are these growth businesses and where are we going to spend more money. We've just, by the way, committed $82 million in our Nutrition & Health business on the CapEx side and we're putting it into our 2 highest-growth platforms because we have great expansion opportunity there. And we're not putting a ton of capital on a couple of our more commoditized, just to give you an example. So that's what we're working on very hard with our teams, and I think that will pay off over the medium term for us on the volume side. Again, quarter-to-quarter, I don't know, but generally, I think we're working the right trend line here to help that so we can hopefully outperform some of these end markets that we have. Because at the end of the day, a lot of our stuff goes into industrial end markets besides Ag and they're kind of flat right now. So we really need to work this mix and where the higher demand is."

And as we look globally, we saw some other country opportunities here and there. We've done some work in Eastern Europe and in Asia in the past, and we'll continue to evaluate those as the opportunities come up and we have the resources available to invest. We know we've got a good model. Every time we do make that change we can point to the payback for those. It's just a matter of how many of those we can handle. As we think about the merger, the proposed merger with Dow and bringing the Dow team in, I can tell you that there is some excitement about how do we take advantage of this -- utilize this route-to-market in certain geographies where, today, Dow and some of their programs doesn't have the kind of visibility that we have.

So I think we follow a lot of the industrials that, actually, you just saw report their numbers over the last 2 weeks. So you've kind of got to go specifically by all our businesses. But I think it's where we're putting some of our dollars and where we're focused in our end markets. We -- by the way, as I did say in the third quarter, just to use that, we did see some strength in the construction market with Tyvek and services. We did some strength in Performance Materials on the auto side. But on the other hand, and let me just give you another example on this whole mix thing, in Industrial Biosciences, our volume was up 5% in the quarter, and it was a lot of application work and product development with some of our big end customers that really drove some of the business on our apparel side and our home and personal care side of the business, and that's where we saw nice growth. So I think that's us introducing innovative products that are helping us drive some share and some opportunity. And again, that's what we have to keep doing because, in the kind of intermediate period, that's going to help us outperform a tough market on the volume side for all of us."

We're really focused on where our R&D is going to drive results. But the one area that Nick and I did not focus on last year and we're making it a big effort for '17 is our whole operations side of the house. We think there's really nice opportunity. As I say, every facility needs to prove what its entitlement is to be best-in-class, and we have -- in fact, we have a couple hundred facilities, but there's 17 of them that are really large and really make a difference in DuPont. And some of those are very large, complex facilities with multiple product lines, and we're really going facility by facility to come up what [ph] the entitlement is and then a program, a very disciplined program of how we start making improvements there. And I think tomorrow or the next day, Nick and I are actually heading out to another one of our facilities. We're hitting them one by one. And so I think that's another area and that will be the next interesting opportunity for us to streamline and get more efficient. And that's not only overhead structure. That's really increased throughput through each facility, which allows us to run more on the same overhead structure and capital structure, and that could be a big benefit for us."

Today, I'd like to give an update on our third quarter performance and the progress we are making with our 3 strategic priorities. We continued our first half momentum in the third quarter. Highlights were sales and volumes grew, gross margins improved, our operating costs declined, segment operating earnings increased, operating margins expanded in all reportable segments and free cash flow improved. 
Total sales increased 1%. Total volumes increased 3% despite a tough macroeconomic backdrop. 5 of the 6 reportable segments grew volumes. Performance Materials, Agriculture and Nutrition & Health contributed the most to the company's volume improvement. Drivers included strength in the global automotive market for Performance Materials, higher corn seed and soybean volumes and growth in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems for Nutrition & Health. 5% volume growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected strong demand for bioactives and biomaterials. Prices for the total company declined 2% partly due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs. 
Operating earnings totaled $0.34 per share, which was a significant improvement versus last year's $0.13 per share. Notably, all of our businesses contributed to the increase in segment operating earnings. While our company-wide gross margins improved 45 basis points, the operating margin expansion in many segments largely came from our cost-savings program. Total operating costs declined by about $235 million for the quarter. 
All in, we are pleased with our financial performance. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating earnings per share to $3.25, a 17% increase from 2015. 
We also continue to make steady progress on our strategic priorities. As we have said, our strategic priorities for 2016 center on 3 drivers of shareholder value creation: cost savings, capital expenditures and working capital. 
We set a target at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end, with a net reduction in costs of $730 million year-over-year. This quarter, we continued to deliver on that goal, and we are pleased with our progress to date. We continue to project that 3/4 of our cost savings for 2016 will come from SG&A. Our goal is to bring our cost structure to best-in-class levels while continuing to fund investments for long-term growth. 
Keep in mind that we have a tough comparison coming up next quarter. There are 2 reasons for that. First, our $730 million target is a net year-over-year metric, and since we began our cost-saving actions in the fourth quarter of last year, we're starting to lap our current leaner structure. Second, we expect compensation to be a headwind, including a recently announced merit increase for non-officer employees. The merit increase was effective on October 1. 
The capital expenditure plan for the year remains $1.1 billion, a 20% reduction versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. 
We have invested $759 million of capital year-to-date. We take a close look at all of our capital projects every quarter in our operating reviews, checking progress and assessing whether updated projections for returns continue to justify the spending. The projects we committed to are largely on track. 
Our third strategic priority is working capital. We have said we see an opportunity for a $1 billion reduction in working capital requirements over the medium term. We made further progress this quarter. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-to-date, led by reductions in working capital and capital expenditures. 
Meanwhile, our planned merger with Dow is progressing as expected. While our interactions with regulators must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with authorities in all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals. We have made a lot of progress in helping regulators understand the dynamics of our industries in which we operate and demonstrating why our merger is procompetitive. We have provided all documents requested to date and will continue to be highly responsive. 
Closing the merger is dependent on satisfying certain conditions, including receiving regulatory clearance from the United States, European Union, Brazil and China. We have made progress in all key jurisdictions. In the event that regulators use their full allotted time, we would expect to close in the first quarter of 2017. However, we are very focused on working closely and constructively with all jurisdictions to receive those approvals as quickly as possible. We will be prepared to close the transaction once all the closing conditions have been met. 
Merger preparations in the third quarter focused on organizational design, finalizing the cost synergy plans and day 1 readiness. We have made good progress on all 3 fronts. We jointly completed plans for organizational design structures for the 3 businesses, and we expect to name the next layer of management for all 3 soon. 
A key priority of our overall organizational design is to continue to support the innovation that will be required to grow each of the businesses and the standalone companies that we intend to create. We have also finalized our projects to deliver the targeted cost synergies. We will be prepared to begin implementing those projects soon after closing, with plans for phasing them in over time in a way that protects business continuity. We have a high confidence level we will realize 70% of the savings on a run-rate basis by the end of the first 12 months after merger close and 100% of the savings on a run-rate basis at the end of 24 months. 
Another significant effort throughout the third quarter and continuing today is around day 1 readiness. We will ensure we are fully functional on the first day of operations. At the same time, we continue preparations for the intended spins.
Together with Dow, we need frequently to review the progress in all areas. Overall, we feel good about the pace of our progress our teams are making to close the merger, to realize the value-creating synergies and position the intended standalone businesses for sustained growth over the long term. We will continue to update you on our progress. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick."

Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered operating earnings of $0.34 per share versus $0.13 per share in the prior year. The businesses continue to execute in a challenging macro environment, delivering total company volume growth and cost savings improvements in the quarter. 
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $4.9 billion increased 1% versus prior year. Total company volumes grew 3%, led by strong demand in Performance Materials, Agriculture, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences. From a regional perspective, demand was driven by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific. 
Local price negatively impacted sales by 2% in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in earnings, contributing $0.15 to the quarter, including a $0.01 benefit from currency. We delivered growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement reflected continued execution on cost savings as well as volume growth in most of our segments. 
A lower tax rate benefited operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings. Lower corporate expenses added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis declined 25% versus prior year as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program. An increase in interest expense due to higher overall debt levels subtracted $0.01 per share from the quarter. 
Now let's turn to the third quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $174 million or 40%. Performance Materials operating earnings increased $54 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China. Operating margins in the segment expanded by about 350 basis points year-over-year. 
Nutrition & Health results increased $33 million. Volume growth of 4% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Operating margins in this segment improved 380 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 13 consecutive quarters. 
Industrial Bioscience operating earnings increased $17 million. Volume growth of 5% was driven by increased demand in bioactives and biomaterials due to growth in home and personal care and in the apparel market. Operating margins improved by 360 basis points in the quarter. 
Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings in the quarter. 
Jim will speak to the Agriculture performance later, and I direct you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on the segment results.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion year-to-date reflected Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital and CapEx year-to-date. Working capital improved by about $400 million primarily due to business-driven actions, and lower tax payments contributed another $200 million. 
Our capital expenditures decreased by about $300 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. 
We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Last week, we announced our 449th consecutive quarterly dividend, and in the third quarter, we completed $416 million in share repurchases resulting in the retirement of 6 million shares. 
As previously communicated, in regards to our 2016 share repurchase plan, we will not complete the full $2 billion stock buyback program by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of the repurchases continues to be dependent upon our trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window reopens shortly after this earnings announcement. 
On Slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to increase 17% versus prior year to $3.25 per share and up from our previously communicated range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share. We now expect our base tax rate for the full year 2016 to be about 23%, representing a $0.07 per share headwind to operating earnings. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and an estimated headwind from currency of about $0.15 per share. We continue to expect sales to be down low single-digits percent versus prior year and about flat with prior year when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Turning now to Slide 8. In the third quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D and other operating charges declined $235 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 14% decrease in costs year-over-year. Actual cost savings in the quarter were higher-than-expected due to a shift in external R&D spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
SG&A costs declined about $150 million or 15% with most of the decline related to G&A cost. Our current corporate costs decreased 25% in the quarter. Changes in variable compensation in both periods significantly impacted the year-over-year comparison. Excluding these changes, corporate costs expenses would have decreased by about 40%, in line with our results in the first half of 2016. As expected, in the fourth quarter, an increase in compensation as well as additional seasonal spending will result in a tougher comp year-over-year for operating expenses. However, we remain on track to deliver $730 million in cost savings in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim who will provide an overview of the results for Ag."

Against a backdrop of challenging mark",877,"Thanks, Nick. I'll provide a review of our financial results and expectations for the fourth quarter, share our view on the latest market conditions and update you on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business. 
Against a backdrop of challenging market conditions, our Ag segment continues to execute well. For the third quarter in a row, we have delivered strong results. Ag sales increased 2% and operating earnings for the quarter were a smaller seasonal loss of $189 million. Our solid performance was driven by a strong start to the Brazil summer season with our new Leptra hybrids continuing their successful launch. Favorable currency and cost savings also helped drive the earnings improvement. 
Our third quarter volume increased 4% with growth in both corn and soybean seeds that was partially offset by lower Crop Protection volumes due to the continued low pest pressure and high inventory in the industry. 
In Latin America, farmers chose a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulting in higher net corn price. The third quarter improvement in our seasonal operating earnings losses was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and a $28 million benefit from currency. It's important to note that the $21 million improvement came despite the absence of $48 million of onetime benefits, which were recorded in the third quarter of last year. 
Year-to-date, our Ag sales of $8.1 billion grew organically by 2%, driven equally by volume and price. In corn seed, we have grown sales in 2016 by 4%, also driven by both volume and price improvements. This was enabled by building upon our leading positions in high-value global markets, including North America, Brazil, Mexico, Southern Europe and South Africa. Our growth reflected the strong performance of our newest products and continued enhancements to our direct route-to-market. 
Our year-to-date segment operating earnings are up 5%, driven by cost savings and favorable pricing, which provided us with the ability to overcome currency headwinds and weakness in the Crop Protection industry. 
So turning to our outlook for the final quarter of the year. We currently expect sales to be down in the mid-single-digits percent range. We expect the seasonal operating earnings loss to be nearly half of what it was in the same quarter of last year. 
The fourth quarter outlook is pressured by timing in 2 respects. First, we are shifting seed deliveries from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2017. That's primarily driven by our Southern route-to-market change to a sales agency model, which is similar to the approach that we utilize in the Midwest. And second, we realized sales in the third quarter to the detriment of the fourth quarter, primarily in Asia and Africa. 
The Ag industry continues to face tough conditions with challenging commodity prices leading to a further decline in net farmer income and high channel inventories. However, one thing remains clear, global demand continues to climb, which places an emphasis on innovation to drive productivity to meet farmers' financial goals and the needs of a growing population. We are helping to drive productivity through new product introductions, such as our newest corn genetics, Leptra and Qrome corn products; our newest Crop Protection products such as Zorvec fungicide; and continued expansion of our Encirca services digital Ag offerings, which were on more than 2 million paid acres this year, more than twice last year. 
I will close with an update on the 3 strategic priorities for our Ag business: first, achieve our cost reductions and earnings commitments; second, deliver the new product pipeline; and third, plan for synergy delivery and ensure we're ready for the new Ag business. 
We are entering the home stretch of 2016 and are on target for both our cost-savings initiatives and our earnings plan. Advancements from our innovation portfolio are a key reason for our strong results. We continue to see favorable market reactions in Latin America to Leptra, which accounted for greater than 50% of our product mix in the Brazil summer season and drove overall price improvements in our year-to-date segment operating results. 
And finally, our integration planning activities continued to progress. During the third quarter, we made significant progress across key work streams. We have invested the time to ensure our readiness for the merger and planned the organizational structure. Now this is important work as we think about bringing 3 successful businesses together as DowDuPont to become 1 Ag division, with increased ability to innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for shareholders. 
We have finalized the plans to meet our commitment of $1.3 billion in cost synergies. While much of this work will continue to be refined as we approach and, ultimately, close the merger, we are highly confident in meeting our overall commitments. 
As we look ahead, science, technology and consumer demand are rapidly changing the face of the industry. Today, offering unparalleled innovation to farmers and investing in new products is a requirement, not a choice. We continue to expect that the complementary combination of our portfolios will enable our R&D organizations to deliver growth through innovation that's above and beyond what our current standalone organizations could have delivered. Innovation will always be an imperative for our business.

It's over 30% of our portfolio in that business. And handsets, by way, is the biggest part of the consumer market for us so -- and that's been weak, and we're seeing that there. But if you take a lot of the other businesses, it's raw material pass-through in Protection, Materials. It's just simply mix in Nutrition & Health, but we're working the mix to our advantage with the probiotics and the ingredients, so I feel good about that long term. And in Ag, it was currency related. So everyone was a little bit different. So when I kind of look at the whole pricing, because Nick and I have been studying this in the ops meetings, I don't see across-the-board price pressure per se on the businesses as we go into '17. It really is a bunch of different issues here. We probably still will have some raw material pass-through in '17, but in general, I don't see that worsening. Hopefully, that improves just slightly."

As you heard us in our prepared remarks, Jeff, we have locked down on all the programs we're allowed to be involved in, premerger, with Dow so we're ready to go in all the projects. The one area that we can't have final detail on, let me say it that way, is on the procurement side because we can't compare contracts directly with our procurement teams. And as I've always said before, in my past experience in life, having done this a few times, is that's where hopefully we get some nice opportunity on the procurement side. We -- and by the way, in our synergies, we've counted on a certain number in the procurement area and my gut is when you look at it on a percentage basis of other deals, it is a little on the lighter side. So I hope we can really jump on that once the merger closes and see some opportunity there. But I'm very, very confident now because we've locked down on the programs and we've got the $3 billion identified and we can move really quickly out of the chute on that. The only caveat I'd say to moving quickly is we've got to be careful in the Ag business, depending where we are in the cycle with the seasons, how we take the cost out.

And probably just this whole comment, just to put it in perspective on the regulatory side, remember we are first in line. I think even the EU commissioner commented on that, that we review things in the order that we get those in a recent statement. And I would also comment, just to put this in perspective, I think sometimes we lose sight, when we put Dow and DuPont Ag together, we're going to be a strong #2 in seed, not a #1, the #2; and in Crop Protection, we're putting the #4 and the #5 player together to create a #3 player. And our goal obviously through that is to have increased innovation and capability to improve our pipeline and speed up our products both on the crop side and on the seed side so -- and we're very confident we can do that.

When we did away with that, we did away with 3 parts -- there really was 3 parts to the matrix. One was in the R&D side, where there was a central -- a fair amount of central R&D and we've embedded that almost now exclusively into the businesses. And oh, by the way, when we get to mergeco and running the 3 divisions, it will all be embedded in the business. And I think that's a huge shift because we're very close to the customer with our R&D in this company. There's a ton of application engineering that goes on, and the closer we are with the R&D in the businesses, the closer we are with our customers, the quicker we're iterating for them and innovating for them. So I think that was big for us, but I don't take lightly. I think what was really big for us was getting rid of the matrix, the global matrix, and again embedding everything into the business. And then the third area, which I think is going to have a huge, huge payback, and I think we're seeing some of it already, is we embedded all the manufacturing in the appropriate businesses, so the Presidents, the P&L leaders have total accountability for every number in their business. And I also think that's helped us. As Nick mentioned earlier, we've driven very good working capital performance very quickly this year, about $600 million so far in the year. And that's not by luck, that's by a lot of hard work. And I think reorganizing the way we did has helped us with that discipline."

And then what -- we have a big focus in the company on mix enrichment because that's really what's going to drive our gross margin improvement. And so, for instance, as I mentioned earlier, in Nutrition & Health, the mix of the businesses with us spending more of our capital on the probiotic Ag side of the business, the cultures and the ingredients, they're the areas growing the fastest and that's at the expense of some of our other concentrates, texturants. And also, we're really working mix -- and by the way, in Ag, Jim can comment, it's a lot of new product launches like Leptra, which we're getting better pricing, better mix. And so we're really focused on that, which is going to drive the gross margin line. And then obviously we've got the cost-reduction efforts going on both in the businesses and across cross-corporate, which is benefiting us. So we've really got a nice mix up and down the P&L."

We had good, strong performance in our seed business in corn, mainly in Latin America, as you heard Ed mention, Leptra. And we actually had a fairly strong finish to the North America selling season as well. And you're right, that was -- that performance in seed was primarily offset by some weakness in our Crop Protection business that was essentially due to Latin America for all the reasons we talked about: inventories, pest pressure and insect protected varieties. The rest of our quarter was really a timing story. We had some crop protect -- some seed and crop sales that landed in third quarter to the detriment of fourth, and that was primarily in Africa and Asia, just a timing thing, so we've adjusted full year based on that. And then we had some timing of some costs that hit us in third quarter to the -- or what were not in third quarter to the detriment of fourth quarter, primarily write-downs from an inventory quality perspective and then some costs tied to R&D contract timing. We pay for a lot of our field trials and contracts sometime here towards the end of the year, and it's a little hard to call that timing, so we had some benefits in third that now we have those costs in fourth. So you're right, when we look at 2017, I think like others, we're predicting still a pretty challenging market as corn commodity prices continue to fall and soybeans a little bit unchanged. It's favoring the soy market, and we are seeing some volatility in pricing in both of those. We launched our programs here back in August, September, and essentially our pricing structure was flat going into that season. And I think this is a real advantage of our route-to-market where we're actually sitting down with growers right now and having conversations with them directly. It gives us good transparency around our pricing activities. It gives us good control of our inventories, and if things start to shift, we can adjust as the season unfolds. But it's still really early to call how 2017 is going to play out. But we're, as I said, essentially flat, and we're going to play it really, really tight as we go into it."

The way those costs have unfolded, we have a little bit that's focused in R&D and sales and marketing. We have some, as Ed mentioned, that are focused on our buy and in the sourcing arena and also a fair amount that's really just tied to our production footprint, especially here in North America, as we start to think about combining production assets both in seed and Crop Protection. So I think maybe the confirmatory news, I wouldn't call it new news, is the synergies are very broad. They're across all aspects of the business, and our teams are working really well together to develop a playbook that is very actionable on day 1."

Having said that, I mean it looks like all forecasts say that housing is dropping off at least from a start standpoint, dropping of some in the 3-month window or rolling window. July, August, September looks like there was a decline of about 1.5%. So not significant, but it looks like there's a little bit of a rollover off of kind of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts, so kind of flat to down a little, so you might see a little bit there. And then on the auto side of the business, it looks like auto builds are going to be down in the couple percent range going into next year. So that's a little bit of a drop from the 5% to 6% that we've kind of been running through the year. So you might see a little there. However, by the way, our demand still looks good for autos, specifically in China, on the Performance Materials side of the business.

We've just, by the way, committed $82 million in our Nutrition & Health business on the CapEx side and we're putting it into our 2 highest-growth platforms because we have great expansion opportunity there. And we're not putting a ton of capital on a couple of our more commoditized, just to give you an example.

We're really focused on where our R&D is going to drive results. But the one area that Nick and I did not focus on last year and we're making it a big effort for '17 is our whole operations side of the house. We think there's really nice opportunity. As I say, every facility needs to prove what its entitlement is to be best-in-class, and we have -- in fact, we have a couple hundred facilities, but there's 17 of them that are really large and really make a difference in DuPont. And some of those are very large, complex facilities with multiple product lines, and we're really going facility by facility to come up what [ph] the entitlement is and then a program, a very disciplined program of how we start making improvements there. And I think tomorrow or the next day, Nick and I are actually heading out to another one of our facilities. We're hitting them one by one. And so I think that's another area and that will be the next interesting opportunity for us to streamline and get more efficient. And that's not only overhead structure. That's really increased throughput through each facility, which allows us to run more on the same overhead structure and capital structure, and that could be a big benefit for us."

And obviously it looks like the guidance on Q4 is a sandbag, but I'll leave that for follow-up. My question is really around the regulatory process and approving of the transaction. We have some visibility on what's going on in the EU, but I really don't have a great feel for where you stand with the U.S., with Brazil, with China. Frankly, I would have thought that the law of averages, 1 of those 3, or 2 or 3 of those 3 would have approved the transaction by now. Where are you specifically with those 3 jurisdictions?"
