I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year. One in which we've delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders. 
Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%.
We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All of these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.
In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities; addressed critical customer needs through our end markets; and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally and geographically.
Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.  For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by the Sciences Magazine, and our next year on 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by Select Science at last year's Pittsburgh conference.
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.
Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations through demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food while regulatory changes are focusing on health of our families and the environment. The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world.
For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on 3 areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions. Second, we are concentrating in expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with different training capabilities, which we believe will gain greater customer value.
A large part of what difference PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.
Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multifaceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and '16 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our her future growth.
With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns.
For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these 4 areas.
Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide to date, there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious-but-treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are inflicted by life-altering conditions, that in some cases, lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference, and we are investing to expand who we test, how we test and for what disorders we test.
For example, many special and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus in developing therapeutics for rare early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screen test needed to implement them. Many times, these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease protection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, new shane muscular dystrophy and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.
Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Diagnostics, which is a developed -- wc is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers with a cost-effective, simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.
In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We are developing new tests, including Multiplex B-based genotyping assays for respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C and HPV as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR asset. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.
Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment. We are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity. 
This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of simple collaborations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality evaluation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.
Recently, we were able to transform our bench-top infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels and batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure the food supply is genuine, unadulterated and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.
Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research to advanced open innovation.
Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our Tipco Spotfire software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytic -- clinical analytics capability and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.
On the server side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities, which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we will expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as establish our service in additional end markets.
To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin and EPS growth.
While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end-market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes. Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earning per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.
Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.
I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full year guidance.
Given the foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.
For the fourth quarter and full year 2015, foreign exchange negatively affect -- impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million, respectively, and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25, respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents currency revenue growth, consequential revenue growth of 5%; organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. 
Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share, respectively.
The trends we saw through the first 3 quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech; stable academic and government spending; healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing; and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.
Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia while the Americas grew low single digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.
In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia. 
Switching to the segments for the fourth quarter. Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue while life sciences solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.
Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits as compared to prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical Imaging grew low single digits in the quarter, as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.
Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.
Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior year comparison.
Geographically, within LSL, Japan continues to be weak was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We have now reached the 1-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well positioned to serve our customers.
Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 40% of reported revenue. Revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand, with particular strength in food as well as incremental licensing revenues.
We are pleased to report that the Perten business at a very good year with solid revenue growth, good margins and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year 1 deal model expectations, and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.
As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now.
For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. Full year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.
Looking at our geographic results for the year. We experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014. 
Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years. A testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.
As to our operating results, full year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. Full year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.
Full year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we are pleased with our operational performance for the full year, as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.
Our full year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings and the lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x.
Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full year 2015 was $307 million.
To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis.
Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance, however, we continue to see the macro economic outlook as mixed.
For the full year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth at a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.
Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to partially -- to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. Our reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.
Our full year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.
For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million, and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.

But I would say just specifically, with regard to beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, it takes fundamentally in a couple of years. I think as we talked about in the past, Medical Imaging I think has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year, so we think that can be down sort of high single, maybe low double digits, and we believe we'll see that recover in the back half. I think also when we think about Japan, Japan I think again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year, and we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because again, we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year, so I would say those are big contributors. But you just sort of walk-through the end market in particular. I think in the case of Pharma Biotech market, we saw a good 15. We grew sort of high single digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit different from the comp, particularly on the OneSource service side, but we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle to the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling some [indiscernible] imagers and some reimaging kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving the back half and moderating, but continue to be a pretty strong market for us. Academic was sort of low single for us. Last year, we think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see probably flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year. I think in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high single digits for 2015. We think that continues, the Perten integration getting well. We start to go up against some difficult comes in China because China was typically strong for us, but we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016. I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end-market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think going into '16, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be sort of more low single digits will probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back. And then finally, on the Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that throughout the year. That was strong for us in 2015, and we think that continues to be strong whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into '16, probably both in the first half as well as the back half."

We think it will be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think they'll be significant -- potentially significant growth down the road. That's #1. I think the second thing is we're starting to see I think good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margin. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple of years, while we had've get operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging up our operating expenses. And as we've done some fact rationalization and shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factories themselves and driving the lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. So I think we're more confident that over the next couple of years, we'll be able to see an improved gross margin and use that asserted of -- in some ways invest more in the businesses. And I would say the third aspect of it is I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing.

We're quite excited about the opportunity. The way I would describe as I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody with our work in newborn and prenatal. Our sense is it's critical to focus on the workflow. So rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS has identified within NIPT, has identified the significant need in opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening, our concern all along has been the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today is not conducive to sort of large-scale population screen. And therefore, we thought what we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that sort of noninvasive screening. And our sense all along is there's got to be a simple format, a simpler workflow and one that can be sort of deploy into the labs that are out there today. As you may know, there's probably 1,500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical testing either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS for clinical testing. So clearly, we needed to find or I think there need to be a simpler workflow, and that's what excites us about. It's simple, it's automated, it's -- you use basically 1 instrument. But your point, it's early on, so we need to invest, but we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel."

But as we sit here, $1.10 for the euro whatever, I think that's going to be more of a challenge. The other thing is we recently, in January, we came in and rather talked about the 2017 target. We've talked more about the longer-term 2020 target. We felt like we could go another 400 basis points to 22%. So I think that's how modeling it. As we model that, we tie R&D going up to 6% of sales or 50% increase in R&D. And the way we're offsetting that is we expect 300 basis points of gross margin expansion, about 150 basis points of SG&A."

I'm just curious, as you've done the analysis and talked about the strengths that wanted to have as a company and the leadership positions, how does -- is it about throwing more money at some of these categories? Is it about being smarter in some of those categories? Is it about -- are there more you could do from a business development standpoint, maybe divesting out of certain assets and utilizing those funds to invest more of the M&A to increase your competitive position?

And so some of that is where we see opportunities and we want to be able to do that. But as I mentioned before, we're all -- this is always going to be a balance for us. We're not -- it's going to be rare in situation where we come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all, but I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins but at the same time investing in this areas that we think have great long-term prospects. So it really gets down to focus and prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, ""Look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile of PerkinElmer going forward.""

And then of course if we decide the strategic fit, it then gets the valuation and can we get good financial returns? And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly, invests in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So that's the process that it goes through. But clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets. I mean, as you pointed out, I mean, I think going forward and I think we've said this for sometime. Probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, maybe bolt-ons by nature hopefully get bigger.

I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year. One in which we've delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders. 
Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%.
We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All of these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.
In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities address the critical customer needs through our end markets; and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally and geographically.
Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.  For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by the Sciences Magazine, and our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by Select Science at last year's Pittsburgh conference.
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.
Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations through demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food while regulatory changes are focusing on health of our families and the environment. The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world.
For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on 3 areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions. Second, we are concentrating in expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiating capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.
A large part of what difference PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.
Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and '16 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.
With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns.
For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these 4 areas.
Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide to date, there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious-but-treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are inflicted by life-altering conditions, that in some cases lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference, and we are investing to expand who we test, how we test and for what disorders we test.
For example, many special and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus in developing therapeutics for rare early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screen test needed to implement them. Many times, these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease protection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.
Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is a developed -- which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers with a cost-effective, simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.
In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We are developing new tests, including Multiplex B-based genotyping assays for a respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C and HPV as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR asset. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.
Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment. We are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity. 
This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality evaluation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.
Recently, we were able to transform our bench-top infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels in batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure the food supply is genuine, unadulterated and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.
Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research to advanced open innovation.
Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire Software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytic -- clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.
On the server side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities, which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we will look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as establish our service in additional end markets.
To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin in EPS growth.
While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end-market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes. Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earning per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.
Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.
I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide with additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full year guidance.
Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.
For the fourth quarter and full year 2015, foreign exchange negatively affect -- impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million, respectively, and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25, respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents currency revenue growth -- consequential revenue growth of 5%; organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. 
Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share, respectively.
The trends we saw through the first 3 quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech; stable academic and government spending; healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing; and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.
Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia while the Americas grew low single digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.
In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia. 
Switching to the segments for the fourth quarter. Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue while life sciences solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.
Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits as compared to prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical Imaging grew low single digits in the quarter, as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.
Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.
Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior year comparison.
Geographically, within LSS, Japan continues to be weak and was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We have now reached the 1-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well-positioned to serve our customers.
Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 14% of reported revenue. Revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand, with particular strength in food as well as incremental licensing revenues.
We are pleased to report that the Perten business at a very good year with solid organic revenue growth, good margins and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year 1 deal model expectations, and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.
As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now.
For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. Full year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.
Looking at our geographic results for the year. We experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014. 
Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years. A testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.
As to our operating results, full year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. Full year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.
Full year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we are pleased with our operational performance for the full year, as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.
Our full year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings in the lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x.
Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance, growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full year 2015 was $307 million.
To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis.
Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance. However, we continue to see the macro economic outlook as mixed.
For the full year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.
Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to partially -- to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. Our reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.
Our full year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.
For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million, and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.

But I would say, just specifically, with regard to beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I'd say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, Medical Imaging, I think, has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year, so we think that could be down sort of high single, maybe low double digits, and we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half. I think also when we think about Japan -- Japan, I think, again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year, and we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because again we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year, so I would say those are big contributors. But to just sort of walk-through the end market in particular, I think in the case of the Pharma Biotech market, we saw a good '15. We grew sort of high single digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from our comp, particularly on the OneSource service side, but we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle to the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling some [indiscernible] imagers and a -- and some reimaging kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving the back half and moderating but continue to be a pretty strong market for us. Academic was sort of low single for us. Last year, we think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see, probably, flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year. I think in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high single digits for 2015. We think that continues, the Perten integration getting well. We start to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us, but we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016. I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end-market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think going into '16, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be, sort of, more low single digits, with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back. And then finally, on a Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that throughout the year. That was strong for us in 2015, and we think that continues to be strong whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into '16, probably both in the first half as well as the back half."

We think it will be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think they'll be significant -- potentially, significant growth down the road. That's #1. I think the second thing is we're starting to see, I think, good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple of years, while we had've good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging up our operating expenses. And as we've done some fact free [ph] rationalization and shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factory themselves and driving the lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple of years, we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that sort of -- in some ways invest more in the businesses.

One is we're going to continue to introduce the things to drive operating margin with whether would that be lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues and that are going to be higher margin as well.

We're quite excited about the opportunity. And the way I would describe it is -- I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is it's critical to focus on the workflow. So rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with an NIPT, has identified the significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening. Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large-scale population screen. And therefore, we thought [ph] what we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that its sort of democratized noninvasive screening. And our sense all along is there's got to be a simple format, a simpler workflow and one that can be sort of deployed into their labs that are out there today. As you may know, there's probably 1,500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical testing either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS for clinical testing. So clearly, we needed to find or I think there needs to be a simpler workflow, and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated, it's -- you use basically 1 instrument. But your point, it's early, and so we need to invest. But we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel."

One, does this guidance fully capture the margin relief associated with the inventory issues you're working through last year associated with the water cell CDL? And then secondly, keeping in mind that part of the reason margin isn't higher, is that you planned a heightened investment in R&D. You've been talking about your R&D investment leading to new product acceleration at the top line. Really is that being a major driver to revenue growth or revenue acceleration? It's not apparent based on recent results in your guidance, but this is happening. So could you just talk about whether you did hit your 2015 new product revenue target of $35 million?

The industrial one is more of a sort of an annual issue. I don't know if it's unique for us based on our product mix, but we are a little concerned about it. To your point, it's not a huge exposure for us. But on the margin, it could be 30 or 40 basis points of growth there. And then I think the other one is we're concerned about the comp on pharma.

I mean, as you pointed out, I mean, I think going forward, and I think we've said this for sometime, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger. But as I think, when we look at the opportunity or the alternative to do something larger either because of fit, strategy or valuations, we don't see much out there quite frankly."

I mean, it seems to me in this environment that, that's a reasonable outcome given the investments. But I guess, as you think about the go forward, I'm not asking for specific long-term guidance, but one would think against my prior play the investments you're making should ultimately yield better top line and then hopefully then more margin expansion. So I guess, as you think about the next few years obviously going forward, I mean, clearly your goal is to be at a materially higher earnings growth rate. Correct? I guess, when you were debating this with the board was the trade off, yes, we maybe less on currency neutral this year, but the hope is this will yield a better outcome than were we were maybe prior to these investments going forward?"

So again, it was just some significant opportunities we saw in the marketplace and we think now is the time to make the investment.

One is we saw a very positive mix shift into Metcar, and we also talked about some licensing revenue, very high margin. And then we also did a lot of work in the fourth quarter. We had some cost controls. And so I'd say that's about half and half. And again, they had a fairly easy comp from a year ago. There's kind of the flip to that with Human Health, where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of '14, so that's much more difficult comp for them. So a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls. As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split. If you look at the full year for '15, I think both businesses contributed. I think if you move forward to '16 and look at the margin expansion, you're going to see more of it coming out of Environmental Health because we're really making the investments in the Human Health segment."

I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year. One in which we've delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders. 
Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%.
We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All of these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.
In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities address the critical customer needs through our end markets; and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally and geographically.
Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.  For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by the Sciences Magazine, and our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by Select Science at last year's Pittsburgh conference.
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.
Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations are demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food while regulatory changes are focusing on health of our families and the environment. The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world.
For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on 3 areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions. Second, we are concentrating in expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiating capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.
A large part of what difference PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.
Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and '16 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.
With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns.
For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these 4 areas.
Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide to date, there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious-but-treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are inflicted by life-altering conditions, that in some cases lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference, and we are investing to expand who we test, how we test and for what disorders we test.
For example, many specialty and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus in developing therapeutics for rare early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screening test needed to implement them. Many times, these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease detection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.
Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is a developed -- which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers with a cost-effective, simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.
In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We are developing new tests, including Multiplex B-based genotyping assays for a respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C and HPV as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR asset. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.
Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment. We are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity. 
This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality evaluation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.
Recently, we were able to transform our bench-top infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels in batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure the food supply is genuine, unadulterated and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.
Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research to advanced open innovation.
Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire Software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytic -- clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.
On the server side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities, which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as establish our service in additional end markets.
To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin in EPS growth.
While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end-market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes. Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earning per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.
Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.
I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide with additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full year guidance.
Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.
For the fourth quarter and full year 2015, foreign exchange negatively affect -- impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million, respectively, and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25, respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents currency revenue growth -- consequential revenue growth of 5%; organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. 
Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share, respectively.
The trends we saw through the first 3 quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech; stable academic and government spending; healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing; and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.
Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia while the Americas grew low single digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.
In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia. 
Switching to the segments for the fourth quarter. Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue while life sciences solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.
Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits as compared to prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical Imaging grew low single digits in the quarter, as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.
Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.
Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior year comparison.
Geographically, within LSS, Japan continues to be weak and was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We have now reached the 1-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well-positioned to serve our customers.
Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 14% of reported revenue. Revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand, with particular strength in food as well as incremental licensing revenues.
We are pleased to report that the Perten business had a very good year with solid organic revenue growth, good margins and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year 1 deal model expectations, and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.
As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now.
For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. Full year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.
Looking at our geographic results for the year. We experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014. 
Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years. A testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.
As to our operating results, full year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. Full year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.
Full year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we are pleased with our operational performance for the full year, as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.
Our full year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings in the lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x.
Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance, growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full year 2015 was $307 million.
To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis.
Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance. However, we continue to see the macro economic outlook as mixed.
For the full year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.
Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to partially -- to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. Our reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.
Our full year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.
For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million, and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.

But I would say, just specifically, with regard to beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I'd say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, Medical Imaging, I think, has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year, so we think that could be down sort of high single, maybe low double digits, and we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half. I think also when we think about Japan -- Japan, I think, again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year, and we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because again we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year, so I would say those are big contributors. But to just sort of walk-through the end market in particular, I think in the case of the Pharma Biotech market, we saw a good '15. We grew sort of high single digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from our comp, particularly on the OneSource service side, but we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle to the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling some [indiscernible] imagers and a -- and some reimaging kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving the back half and moderating but continue to be a pretty strong market for us. Academic was sort of low single for us. Last year, we think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see, probably, flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year. I think in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high single digits for 2015. We think that continues, the Perten integration going well. We start to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us, but we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016. I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end-market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think going into '16, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be, sort of, more low single digits, with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back. And then finally, on a Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that throughout the year. That was strong for us in 2015, and we think that continues to be strong whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into '16, probably both in the first half as well as the back half."

We think it will be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think they'll be significant -- potentially, significant growth down the road. That's #1. I think the second thing is we're starting to see, I think, good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple of years, while we've had good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging up our operating expenses. And as we've done some factory rationalization and shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factory themselves and driving the lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple of years, we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that sort of -- in some ways invest more in the businesses. And I would say the third aspect of it is, I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing. And I think what you'll see going forward is a more concerted effort to invest in those areas where I think we've got leadership positions and terrific capabilities.

And I think we're going to do drive, potentially, more upside from that with some things that are going on in our gross margin that Rob just mentioned. So I think at this stage, it may not be completely linear, but I think 2 things. One is we're going to continue to do the things that drive operating margin with whether would that be lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues and that are going to be higher margin as well.

We're quite excited about the opportunity. And the way I would describe it is -- I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is it's critical to focus on the workflow. So rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with an NIPT, has identified the significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening. Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large-scale population screen. And therefore, we thought [ph] what we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that its sort of democratized noninvasive screening. And our sense all along is there's got to be a simple format, a simpler workflow and one that can be sort of deployed into their labs that are out there today. As you may know, there's probably 1,500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical testing either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS for clinical testing. So clearly, we needed to find or I think there needs to be a simpler workflow, and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated, it's -- you use basically 1 instrument. But your point, it's early, and so we need to invest. But we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel."

The Q1 issue is more tied to medical imaging and some sort of large revenue recognition that we had in informatics in the first quarter. So those 2 are separate. The industrial one is more of a sort of an annual issue. I don't know if it's unique for us based on our product mix, but we are a little concerned about it. To your point, it's not a huge exposure for us. But on the margin, it could be 30 or 40 basis points of growth there. And then I think the other one is we're concerned about the comp on pharma. And so instead of growing high single digits as we did in 2015, we probably think that moderates to sort of mid-single. Those are basically the 2 things as we look into '16 versus '15 that we think are different."

I mean, we're not -- it's going to be rare in situation where we come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all, but I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins but at the same time investing in those areas that we think have great long-term prospects. So it really gets down to focus on prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, ""Look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile of PerkinElmer going forward.""

And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly, invests in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So that's the process that it goes through. But clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets. I mean, as you pointed out, I mean, I think going forward, and I think we've said this for sometime, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger.

I think -- what we're seeing in our business is the consumable still to do okay but I would say in the capital equipment area is where the challenge has been. And unfortunately in Japan, for us, it's probably more of an instrument play than it is a consumable play.

And then I think the other thing that will help is clearly the move -- the mix shift as we -- partly the new products come out also as we sort of focus on these areas that have a tendency to be higher growth and higher margin. So I think the combination of those will make up 70 basis points. I would say we're assuming for 2016 very little price. And so if we can get some price, that would be great.

So we're looking to do is take -- if you think about the ELN as a data repository and you think of Spotfire as the ability to give you good analytics and visualization, we're now working on that sort of in between that gap. So our approach is to make sure that we get the right data to the right people very easily in sort of a scalable, very usable format. And we're getting a lot of receptivity around that and we're building some terrific capabilities.

There's kind of the flip to that with Human Health, where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of '14, so that's much more difficult comp for them. So a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls. As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split.

I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year. One in which we've delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders. 
Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%.
We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All of these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.
In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities address the critical customer needs through our end markets; and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally and geographically.
Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.  For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by the Sciences Magazine, and our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by Select Science at last year's Pittsburgh conference.
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.
Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations are demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food while regulatory changes are focusing on health of our families and the environment. The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world.
For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on 3 areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions. Second, we are concentrating in expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiating capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.
A large part of what difference PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.
Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and '16 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.
With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns.
For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these 4 areas.
Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide to date, there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious-but-treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are inflicted by life-altering conditions, that in some cases lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference, and we are investing to expand who we test, how we test and for what disorders we test.
For example, many specialty and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus in developing therapeutics for rare early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screening test needed to implement them. Many times, these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease detection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.
Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is a developed -- which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers with a cost-effective, simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.
In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We are developing new tests, including Multiplex B-based genotyping assays for a respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C and HPV as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR asset. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.
Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment. We are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity. 
This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality evaluation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.
Recently, we were able to transform our bench-top infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels in batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure the food supply is genuine, unadulterated and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.
Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research to advanced open innovation.
Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire Software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytic -- clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.
On the server side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities, which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as establish our service in additional end markets.
To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin in EPS growth.
While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end-market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes. Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.
Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.
I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide with additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full year guidance.
Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.
For the fourth quarter and full year 2015, foreign exchange negatively affect -- impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million, respectively, and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25, respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents currency revenue growth -- consequential revenue growth of 5%; organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. 
Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share, respectively.
The trends we saw through the first 3 quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech; stable academic and government spending; healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing; and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.
Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia while the Americas grew low single digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.
In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia. 
Switching to the segments for the fourth quarter. Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue while life sciences solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.
Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits as compared to prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical Imaging grew low single digits in the quarter, as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.
Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.
Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior year comparison.
Geographically, within LSS, Japan continues to be weak and was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We have now reached the 1-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well-positioned to serve our customers.
Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 14% of reported revenue. Revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand, with particular strength in food as well as incremental licensing revenues.
We are pleased to report that the Perten business had a very good year with solid organic revenue growth, good margins and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year 1 deal model expectations, and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.
As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now.
For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. Full year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.
Looking at our geographic results for the year. We experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014. 
Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years. A testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.
As to our operating results, full year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. Full year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.
Full year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we are pleased with our operational performance for the full year, as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.
Our full year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings in the lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x.
Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance, growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full year 2015 was $307 million.
To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis.
Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance. However, we continue to see the macro economic outlook as mixed.
For the full year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.
Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to partially -- to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. Our reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.
Our full year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.
For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million, and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.

But I would say, just specifically, with regard to beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I'd say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, Medical Imaging, I think, has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year, so we think that could be down sort of high single, maybe low double digits, and we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half. I think also when we think about Japan -- Japan, I think, again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year, and we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because again we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year, so I would say those are big contributors. But to just sort of walk-through the end market in particular, I think in the case of the Pharma Biotech market, we saw a good '15. We grew sort of high single digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from our comp, particularly on the OneSource service side, but we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle to the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling some [indiscernible] imagers and a -- and some reimaging kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving the back half and moderating but continue to be a pretty strong market for us. Academic was sort of low single for us. Last year, we think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see, probably, flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year. I think in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high single digits for 2015. We think that continues, the Perten integration going well. We start to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us, but we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016. I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end-market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think going into '16, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be, sort of, more low single digits, with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back. And then finally, on a Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that throughout the year. That was strong for us in 2015, and we think that continues to be strong whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into '16, probably both in the first half as well as the back half."

But as we think about a 3% to 5% versus 3% to 4%, it's still -- we still feel like it's in the sort of 3% to 4% range. So I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't read a significant deceleration into that."

We think it will be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think they'll be significant -- potentially, significant growth down the road. That's #1. I think the second thing is we're starting to see, I think, good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple of years, while we've had good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging up our operating expenses. And as we've done some factory rationalization and shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factory themselves and driving the lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple of years, we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that sort of -- in some ways invest more in the businesses. And I would say the third aspect of it is, I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing. And I think what you'll see going forward is a more concerted effort to invest in those areas where I think we've got leadership positions and terrific capabilities. So I think it's a combination of all those things."

And I think we're going to do drive, potentially, more upside from that with some things that are going on in our gross margin that Rob just mentioned. So I think at this stage, it may not be completely linear, but I think 2 things. One is we're going to continue to do the things that drive operating margin with whether would that be lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues and that are going to be higher margin as well.

We're quite excited about the opportunity. And the way I would describe it is -- I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is it's critical to focus on the workflow. So rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with an NIPT, has identified the significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening. Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large-scale population screen. And therefore, we thought [ph] what we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that its sort of democratized noninvasive screening. And our sense all along is there's got to be a simple format, a simpler workflow and one that can be sort of deployed into their labs that are out there today. As you may know, there's probably 1,500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical testing either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS for clinical testing. So clearly, we needed to find or I think there needs to be a simpler workflow, and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated, it's -- you use basically 1 instrument. But your point, it's early, and so we need to invest. But we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel."

I think if you went back and try to do it on sort of a pro forma basis based on euro of $1.25 or something when we set this up, my sense is we probably could get to the 20%. But as we sit here, $1.10 for the euro or whatever, I think that's going to be more of a challenge. The other thing is we recently, in January, we came in and rather talked about the 2017 target. We've talked more about longer-term 2020 target, and felt like we could go another 400 basis points to 22%. So I think that's how we're modeling it. As we model that, we had R&D going up to 6% of sales or 50% increase in R&D. And the way we're offsetting that is we expect 300 basis points of gross margin expansion, about 150 basis points of SG&A."

You want to focus in the 4 key categories where you think you can be a real leader in your markets. And I'm just curious, as you've done the analysis and thought about the strengths that you want to have as a company and the leadership positions, how does -- is it about throwing more money at some of these categories? Is it about being smarter in some of those categories? Is it about -- are there more you could do from a business development standpoint, maybe divesting out of certain assets and utilizing those funds to invest more of the M&A to increase your competitive position? I'm just kind of curious internally how you kind of come to the decision to jack -- to boost the R&D spending?"

And so some of that is where we see opportunities to invest, we want to be able to do that. But as I mentioned before, we're all -- this is always going to be a balance for us. I mean, we're not -- it's going to be rare in situation where we come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all, but I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins but at the same time investing in those areas that we think have great long-term prospects. So it really gets down to focus on prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, ""Look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile of PerkinElmer going forward."" And I think the 4 areas that I identified are ones that are clearly getting a disproportionate part of the investment. And for the foreseeable future, I think that will be the case."

And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly, invests in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So that's the process that it goes through. But clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets. I mean, as you pointed out, I mean, I think going forward, and I think we've said this for some time, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger.

We think you have more efficiency and where we see that is sort of expand our capacity. And then consequently, we were looking at actually pulling some stuff that we've outsourced historically in. So we think we can get some savings there. I think, clearly in the supply chain, as I think we've talked about before, when we were moving a number of the factories we did probably -- or we weren't as aggressive on the supply chain, so we're putting plans to do that. And then I think the other thing that will help is clearly the move -- the mix shift as we -- partly the new products come out also as we sort of focus on these areas that have a tendency to be higher growth and higher margin. So I think the combination of those will make up 70 basis points. I would say we're assuming for 2016 very little price. And so if we can get some price, that would be great. But our assumption is that price is pretty flat for us, and so it's really coming from productivity and mix."

There's kind of the flip to that with Human Health, where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of '14, so that's much more difficult comp for them. So a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls. As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split. If you look at the full year for '15, I think both businesses contributed.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.
Turning first to our financial performance. We exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macro economic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our top line and earnings per share expectations for the full year.
While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of a few market conditions are a bit mixed, these are the areas that, for the most part, impact a relatively small portion of our overall business. 
For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits to somewhat a tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this is more than offset by better-than-expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and a number of emerging markets. We also continue to see persistent headwind in certain geographies such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment, which continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.
Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on Human and Environmental Health.
As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, PerkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions to help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge. In addition, by disproportionally directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of Pharma Biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single-digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility. This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real-world challenges. 
For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our apparatus TSL sell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water emergent energy with direct LED illumination, enabling up to 4x higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of dementia.
In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. tired utilizing our Operetta and Janice liquid handling systems to stream compounds that inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus.
Another important offering from our research imaging platform is our recently introduced Phenoptics quantitative pathology system, which allows quantitative and special imaging analysis. 
Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Cancer Research Center and Johns Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD1 drug from Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, a second study by published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test, using our platform to measure not only PD-L1 expression but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD1 positive immune cells, leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single Plex IHD tests. Both of these studies reinforced our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immuno interactions, therefore, better enabling our customers for precision medicine.
In the area of Diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. Allowable provide competence of many of diagnostics screen services to hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians. 
In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China, as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading skid tests. 
In China, a higher one business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter, as customers work to meet the new play testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry-leading [indiscernible] molecular blood screening systems, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.
Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week, we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to European scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S. 
Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expected mothers.
Within food testing, we grew our third franchise with the acquisition of Delta instruments. Delta is another one's base manufacture of infrared manufacturers and flow cytometors is for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components and somatic cells in milk. We're also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.
Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into in-line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. Consumers already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control. 
While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more subset bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter, we brought back $150 million of stock as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt-on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing, we're operating our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our lean applications and operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable costs. In addition, we're using an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product costs by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines. 
Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better-than-expected financial performance in the first quarter.
So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancements of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.
As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.Star",1609,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the first quarter. We were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution in a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities and still deliver solid financial results.
For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the BP and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our lean and productivity initiatives.
Nonoperating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately $0.01 or were partially offset by approximately $0.01 resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.
As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.
Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter. Our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-signal digits growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in the Americas.
In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.
We are pleased with our solid results in China as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health at segments. Our high-end blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins by high-end estimate placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand.
On the environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions was a key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing in lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our lean activities.
Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives.
As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our 4 strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis as we announced last quarter.
Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016 as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. First quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million, and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was the result of the geographic distribution of profit and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter.
We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.
Consistent with our comments in February, we completed a buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization.
The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2x.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future and new product introductions.
For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
Turning to our segment results for the first quarter. Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by a healthy mid-single-digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Medical Imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the Medical Imaging portfolio.
Organic revenue in our life sciences solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits.
Growth was broad-based globally with continued strength from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions, including our High Content Screening platform.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. We are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our food and environmental testing solutions, however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter.
We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on the new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.
Looking at segment margins. Environmental Health segment margins expanded 470 basis points. A strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%.
Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.
For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. 
Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.
Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook. We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share, coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange.
As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact to foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.
And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD lab services business, which was a little over $0.01.
As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.80.
As always, when assisting our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.
This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

Just to give you an example. If you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would have grown high single digits. And largely, in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So that's a situation where we're going to continue to invest in those and hope to make those a bigger portion of the company. And then obviously over time, we think the overall growth, organic growth could hopefully average up to a higher number.

And what I would say is, first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals in the team. We're on track relative to our milestones, given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say the 1 area where I think we continue to be very pleased with is we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Homburg as well as in the [indiscernible] sample prep. So we think we were pleased that over the last couple of months, we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late '17 or early '18. But indications are on track. I would say with regard to the NTD divestiture, that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with our -- I'll call it regulated services within the U.S., our U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons. One is fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required, so we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure around the regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement. And so that was a big consideration. The other thing was as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and quite frankly, stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think -- and maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis developments, is as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners. And so I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it made sense to sell the NTD lab services."

I would say the difference between 3 months ago and now is not necessarily the fact we slowdown in R&D. And I think Andy alluded this to some extent. It's actually be seeing the benefits of our productivity and lean initiatives sooner than we thought, and I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.",1411,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.
Turning first to our financial performance. We exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macro economic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our top line and earnings per share expectations for the full year.
While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of a few market segments are a bit mixed, these are the areas that, for the most part, impact a relatively small portion of our overall business. 
For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits to somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this is more than offset by better-than-expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and a number of emerging markets. We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.
Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on Human and Environmental Health.
As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, PerkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions to help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge. In addition, by disproportionally directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of Pharma and Biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single-digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility. This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real-world challenges. 
For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary  automated water-immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to 4x higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of dementia.
In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems to screen compounds that inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus.
Another important offering from our research imaging platform is our recently introduced Phenoptics quantitative pathology system, which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. 
Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Johns Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD1 drug from Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test, using our platform to measure not only PD-L1 expression but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD1 positive immune cells, leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single Plex IHC test. Both of these studies reinforced our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore, better enabling our customers for precision medicine.
In the area of Diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services to hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians. 
In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China, as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID test.
In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry-leading [indiscernible] molecular blood screening systems, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.
Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week, we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to Eurofin Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S. 
Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers.
Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacture of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components and somatic cells in milk. We're also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.
Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in-line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. Consumers already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control. 
While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more subset of bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter, we brought back $150 million of stock as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt-on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing, we're upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our lean applications and operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable costs. In addition, we're using an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product costs by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines. 
Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better-than-expected financial performance in the first quarter.
So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancements of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.
As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.Star",1606,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the first quarter. We were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution in a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities and still deliver solid financial results.
For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat, and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our lean and productivity initiatives.
Nonoperating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately $0.01 or were partially offset by approximately $0.01 resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.
As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.
Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter. Our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-signal digits growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in the Americas.
In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.
We are pleased with our solid results in China as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our high-end blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins by high-end instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand.
On the environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing in lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our lean activities.
Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives.
As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our 4 strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis as we announced last quarter.
Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016 as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. First quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million, and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was the result of the geographic distribution of profit and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter.
We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.
Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization.
The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2x.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions.
For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
Turning to our segment results for the first quarter. Environmental Health, organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single-digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Medical Imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the Medical Imaging portfolio.
Organic revenue in our life sciences solution business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits.
Growth was broad-based globally with continued strength from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions, including our High Content Screening platform.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. We are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our food and environmental testing solutions, however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter.
We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on the new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.
Looking at segment margins. Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points. A strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%.
Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.
For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. 
Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.
Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook. We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share, coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange.
As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact to foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.
And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD Laboratory Services Business, which was a little over a $0.01.
As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.80.
As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.
This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

Just to give you an example. If you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would have grown high single digits. And largely, in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So we got a situation where we're going to continue to invest in those and hope to make those a bigger portion of the company. And then obviously over time, we think the overall growth, organic growth could hopefully average up to a higher number.

And what I would say is, first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals in the team. We're on track relative to our milestones, given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say the 1 area where I think we continue to be very pleased with is we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Homburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think we were pleased that over the last couple of months, we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late '17 or early '18. But indications are on track. I would say with regard to the NTD divestiture, that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with our -- I'll call it regulated services within the U.S., or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons. One is fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required, so we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure around the regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement. And so that was a big consideration. The other thing was as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and quite frankly a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think -- and maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis developments, is as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners. And so I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it made sense to sell the NTD lab services."

I would say the difference between 3 months ago and now is not necessarily the fact we slowed down R&D. And I think, Andy, alluded this to some extent. It's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and lean initiatives sooner than we thought, and I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.",1411,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.
Turning first to our financial performance. We exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macro economic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our top line and earnings per share expectations for the full year.
While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of a few market segments are a bit mixed, these are the areas that, for the most part, impact a relatively small portion of our overall business. 
For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits to somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this is more than offset by better-than-expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and a number of emerging markets. We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.
Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on Human and Environmental Health.
As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, PerkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions to help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge. In addition, by disproportionally directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of Pharma and Biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single-digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility. This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real-world challenges. 
For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water-immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to 4x higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of dementia.
In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems to screen compounds that inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus.
Another important offering from our research imaging platform is our recently introduced Phenoptics quantitative pathology system, which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. 
Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Johns Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD1 drug from Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test, using our platform to measure not only PD-L1 expression but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD1 positive immune cells, leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single Plex IHC test. Both of these studies reinforced our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore, better enabling our customers for precision medicine.
In the area of Diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services to hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians. 
In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China, as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID test.
In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry-leading cheetah[ph] molecular blood screening systems, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.
Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week, we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to Eurofin Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S. 
Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers.
Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacture of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components and somatic cells in milk. We're also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.
Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in-line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. Consumers already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control. 
While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more subset of bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter, we brought back $150 million of stock as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt-on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing, we're upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our lean applications and operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable costs. In addition, we're using an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product costs by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines. 
Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better-than-expected financial performance in the first quarter.
So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancements of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.
As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.Star",1606,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the first quarter. We were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution in a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities and still deliver solid financial results.
For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat, and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our lean and productivity initiatives.
Nonoperating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately $0.01 or were partially offset by approximately $0.01 resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.
As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.
Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter. Our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-signal digits growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in the Americas.
In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.
We are pleased with our solid results in China as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our high-end blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins by high-end instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand.
On the environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing in lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our lean activities.
Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives.
As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our 4 strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis as we announced last quarter.
Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016 as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. First quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million, and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was the result of the geographic distribution of profit and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter.
We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.
Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization.
The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2x.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions.
For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
Turning to our segment results for the first quarter. Environmental Health, organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single-digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Medical Imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the Medical Imaging portfolio.
Organic revenue in our life sciences solution business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits.
Growth was broad-based globally with continued strength from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions, including our High Content Screening platform.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. We are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our food and environmental testing solutions, however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter.
We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on our new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.
Looking at segment margins. Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points. A strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%.
Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.
For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. 
Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.
Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook. We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share, coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange.
As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact to foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.
And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD Lab Services Business, which was a little over a $0.01.
As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.80.
As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.
This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

Just to give you an example. If you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would have grown high single digits. And largely, in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So we got a situation where we're going to continue to invest in those and hope to make those a bigger portion of the company.

And what I would say is, first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals in the team. We're on track relative to our milestones, given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say the 1 area where I think we continue to be very pleased with is we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Homburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think we were pleased that over the last couple of months, we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late '17 or early '18. But indications are on track. I would say with regard to the NTD divestiture that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with our -- I'll call it regulated services within the U.S., or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons. One is fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required, so we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure around the regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement. And so that was a big consideration. The other thing was as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and quite frankly a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think -- and maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis developments, is as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners. And so I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it made sense to sell the NTD lab services."

So those are the sort of 3 big drivers. If you look at industrial specifically, it was down low single digits, and I would say the driver to that was, one, very difficult comparison. So it was up high single digits in Q1 of '15. And then the other area was we saw a little bit of weakness in what we call sort of material characterization, which is larger in areas like polymers, maybe a little bit in sort of paints and chemicals. And I would spike that out from sort of a product perspective. Whether it's sustainable or not, I would say we are not forecasting that type of growth to continue in the year.

And now as we look ahead given that you grew better than expected in the quarter and you guide out -- guided up expectations, should we expect investment to ramp from here and maybe even more so?

I guess, I'm just trying to figure out if we're getting ahead of ourselves given that while you did beat Q1 expectations, the organic growth was still only 3.5%, 4% against a favorable comp, which I know you want to do better.

I would say the difference between 3 months ago and now is not necessarily the fact we slowed down R&D. And I think, Andy, alluded this to some extent. It's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and lean initiatives sooner than we thought, and I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter.

Instruments have been a little bit more of a struggle. On the Human Health side, we implemented some new pricing programs and some discounting programs within our sales organization late in the fourth quarter last year, and we've rolled those out across the geographies. We're starting to see the traction first in the U.S. and we think we'll start to see traction in Europe and Asia to follow. But that's really where it's been focused. I think we'll probably take some of those learnings and port those over to Environmental Health as well. So hopefully, we can see some upside there.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.",1412,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.
Turning first to our financial performance. We exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macro economic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our top line and earnings per share expectations for the full year.
While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of a few market segments are a bit mixed, these are the areas that, for the most part, impact a relatively small portion of our overall business. 
For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits to somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this is more than offset by better-than-expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and a number of emerging markets. We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.
Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on Human and Environmental Health.
As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, PerkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions to help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge. In addition, by disproportionally directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of Pharma and Biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single-digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility. This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real-world challenges. 
For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water-immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to 4x higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms of dementia.
In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems to screen compounds that inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus.
Another important offering from our research imaging platform is our recently introduced Phenoptics quantitative pathology system, which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. 
Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Johns Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD1 drug from Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test, using our platform to measure not only PD-L1 expression but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD1 positive immune cells, leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single Plex IHC test. Both of these studies reinforced our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore, better enabling our customers for precision medicine.
In the area of Diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services to hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians. 
In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China, as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID test.
In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry-leading cheetah [ph] molecular blood screening systems, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.
Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week, we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to Eurofin Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S. 
Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers.
Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacture of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components and somatic cells in milk. We're also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.
Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in-line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. Consumers already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control. 
While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more subset of bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter, we brought back $150 million of stock as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt-on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing, we're upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our lean applications and operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable costs. In addition, we're using an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product costs by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines. 
Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better-than-expected financial performance in the first quarter.
So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancements of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.
As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy."

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.Star",1606,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our second quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the first quarter. We were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution in a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities and still deliver solid financial results.
For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. A strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat, and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our lean and productivity initiatives.
Nonoperating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately $0.01 or were partially offset by approximately $0.01 resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.
As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.
Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter. Our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-signal digits growth in Europe and low single-digit growth in the Americas.
In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.
We are pleased with our solid results in China as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our high-end blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins by high-end instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand.
On the environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing in lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our lean activities.
Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives.
As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our 4 strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis as we announced last quarter.
Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016 as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. First quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million, and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was the result of the geographic distribution of profit and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter.
We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.
Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization.
The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2x.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions.
For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
Turning to our segment results for the first quarter. Environmental Health, organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago.
From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single-digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Medical Imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the Medical Imaging portfolio.
Organic revenue in our life sciences solution business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits.
Growth was broad-based globally with continued strength from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions, including our High Content Screening platform.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. We are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our food and environmental testing solutions, however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter.
We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on our new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.
Looking at segment margins. Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points. A strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%.
Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.
For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. 
Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.
Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook. We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share, coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange.
As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact to foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.
And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD Lab Services Business, which was a little over a $0.01.
As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with a midpoint of $2.80.
As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.
This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

Just to give you an example. If you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would have grown high single digits. And largely, in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So we got a situation where we're going to continue to invest in those and hope to make those a bigger portion of the company.

And what I would say is, first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals in the team. We're on track relative to our milestones, given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say the 1 area where I think we continue to be very pleased with is we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Homburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think we were pleased that over the last couple of months, we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late '17 or early '18. But indications are on track. I would say with regard to the NTD divestiture that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with our -- I'll call it regulated services within the U.S., or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons. One is fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required, so we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure around the regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement. And so that was a big consideration. The other thing was as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and quite frankly a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think -- and maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis developments, is as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners. And so I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it made sense to sell the NTD lab services."

So more in the sort of air and water  area was also a good grower. And then I would sort of spike out China specifically. I talked about that fact that China was double-digit growth for us. So those are the sort of 3 big drivers. If you look at industrial specifically, it was down low single digits, and I would say the driver to that was, one, very difficult comparison. So it was up high single digits in Q1 of '15. And then the other area was we saw a little bit of weakness in what we call sort of material characterization, which is larger in areas like polymers, maybe a little bit in sort of paints and chemicals. And I would spike that out from sort of a product perspective. Whether it's sustainable or not, I would say we are not forecasting that type of growth to continue in the year. I mean, I would say that we think environmental sort of moderates probably more to a lower single digit growth as we look at in this sort of second, third and fourth quarters."

I think you're going to start to see the lean initiatives and the productivity initiatives being implemented within operations, start to accelerate in the second, third and fourth quarters. And as we said, we think our gross margin expansion for the year will be somewhere in the 70 to 80 basis point range.

And now as we look ahead given that you grew better than expected in the quarter and you guide out -- guided up expectations, should we expect investment to ramp from here and maybe even more so?

I guess, I'm just trying to figure out if we're getting ahead of ourselves given that while you did beat Q1 expectations, the organic growth was still only 3.5%, 4% against a favorable comp, which I know you want to do better.

I would say the difference between 3 months ago and now is not necessarily the fact we slowed down R&D. And I think, Andy, alluded this to some extent. It's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and lean initiatives sooner than we thought, and I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter.

Instruments have been a little bit more of a struggle. On the Human Health side, we implemented some new pricing programs and some discounting programs within our sales organization late in the fourth quarter last year, and we've rolled those out across the geographies. We're starting to see the traction first in the U.S. and we think we'll start to see traction in Europe and Asia to follow. But that's really where it's been focused. I think we'll probably take some of those learnings and port those over to Environmental Health as well. So hopefully, we can see some upside there. But I'd say right now, in the consumables and reagents, we do get price typically and then a recent, which I spiked out, we got some product price on the Human Health side."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specificall",1096,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 
As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margin by 90 basis points and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million. Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world, as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers. 
Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top line growth targets. 
In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter as a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year focused on 3 areas: First, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly depreciated solutions resulting in tangible customer value; second, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunity to increase to maintain or capture leading share positions; and third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness through investor competitiveness and improved profitability. 
Turning first to innovating with our customers. A good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in realtime, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms. 
In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we are successful in expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our organic capabilities with pertain and [indiscernible] expertise into new applications and products. 
In the fast growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of this rare inherited metabolic disorders for clients with the [indiscernible] recommended newborn screening pattern. 
We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. This includes the Audio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Audio 200 helps allow professionals perform complex multi-elemental and organic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing. Additionally, in research business we continue to launch new assays with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications for the market did this year alone. During Q2, we launched an NGS 3 KSA, which runs on our lab Chip touch micro [indiscernible] platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lower DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments. 
We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific. A company based in Austin, Texas that provide biotechnology solutions for food and feed safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions. 
To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in 4 priority areas. These areas include food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues. 
The benefit of strategy are already paying off. In the second quarter, organic are for all 4 of these areas grew by greater than 10% and in each of these areas is the rate of growth increased sequentially. Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in this businesses helped offset headwinds in the markets as well as the declining demand in medical imaging. 
Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue. 
Turning to our progress on operational execution. We have experienced excellent gross margin experience -- expansion during the first 2 quarters of this year. Our multi-faceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality and providing customers with the superior experience continues to pay off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements. First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing lean throughout our manufacturing sites. 
Second, we just launched a design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. This initiative involve R&D and manufacturing working together and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost-effectively. 
As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to seek accelerating growth for diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and the addressable market. In addition, our one-source business continues to the benefit from the growth in Pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth in the market. 
However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning, as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail.

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook. Sta",1355,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook. 
Starting with the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with our operational execution, the success from key lean and indirect spending initiatives that afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver a solid financial results to our shareholders. 
For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately at the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66. 
Overall, the quarter played essentially as expected. Looking at our end markets, we saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales and strong growth in food. The strength was partially offset by softer-than-expected industrial end market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S. due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison. 
Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter. We experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single digit growth in Europe and low single-digit decline in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets where second quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient. 
At China specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Health and Environmental segments. Within Environmental Health, our [indiscernible] blood screening business had another solid performance, which is expected to continue into the second half of 2016. 
On the environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China. 
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful lean initiatives volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our lean activities. Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth. 
Looking at research and development. Second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year driven by ongoing investments in our 4 strategic initiatives, emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food and reproductive health, including R&D funding supporting [indiscernible], an acquisition we announced in the first quarter. 
Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points while still funding incremental R&D investments. 
Looking below the operating line. Second quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first half 2016 adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. In July, we announced the successful completion of a EUR 500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenor[ph] and a 1.875 coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives. 
We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million, as compared to $101 million from the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million. 
I'd also like to note that our Board recently approved a new 2-year 8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016. 
Turning to our segment results. For the second quarter, human health organic revenue grew approximately 6% with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our human health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016, with diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue. 
Second quarter 2016 organic revenue from diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent [indiscernible] highlighted in previous quarters. 
In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance. 
Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the diversification efforts within the portfolio gained traction. However, the business overall declined high single-digits from the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand. 
As expected, organic revenue in our life sciences solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in Pharma and Biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and informatics franchises. 
As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter due in part of a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. Organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offering, which grew double-digit in China, but was offset by softer-than-expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving, but the modest growth for the second half bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier. 
Looking at operating segment margins. The results were essentially in line with the expectations. Environmental Health margin expanded 160 basis points, a strong mix prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution all contributed to this performance in the quarter. 
Human Health margins were essentially flat largely due to a planned growth investments and mix partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance, with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets. 
As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. 
Looking at our outlook. For the full year, on the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results. And while we expect the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we remain [indiscernible] in our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, with the midpoint of $2.80.

And so obviously, we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately, if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives, there probably should be another growth.

You've looked really well positioned given the focus on a number of things including, but not limited to, food and water testing as well as increased funding for things or increased focus on things like neonatal testing. I'm just wondering, in the early days, are you hearing or seeing anything that suggests we should be contemplating this dynamic? And is that something you've factored into guidance?

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically,",1095,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million. Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers.
Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top line growth targets.
In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on 3 areas: first, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly depreciated solutions resulting in tangible customer value; second, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions; and third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness through advanced competitiveness and improve profitability.
Turning first to innovating with our customers. A good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in realtime, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.
In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we are successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our integrated capabilities with Perkin and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.
In the fast growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders for clients with HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.
We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. This includes the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Avio 200 helps the lab professionals perform complex multi-elemental inorganic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing.
Additionally, in our research business, we continue to launch new assays with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications throughout the market this year alone.
During Q2, we launched an NGS 3k assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.
We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific (sic) [ BioScience ], a company based in Austin, Texas that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed -- safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.
To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in 4 priority areas. These areas include food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues.
The benefit of this strategy are already paying off. In the second quarter, organic revenue for all 4 of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas, the rate of growth increased sequentially. Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial end markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging.
Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.
Turning to our progress on operational execution. We have experienced excellent gross margin experience -- expansion during the first 2 quarters of this year. Our multi-faceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay-off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements. First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing lean throughout our manufacturing sites.
Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost-effectively.
As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to seek accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and the addressable market. In addition, our one-source business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth in the market.
However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?"
268363,373004837,1026266,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook.Star",1353,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the second quarter. We continue to be pleased with our operational execution, the success from key lean and indirect spending initiatives that have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver a solid financial results to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66. Overall, the quarter played essentially as expected.
Looking at our end markets. We saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales and strong growth in food. The strength, however, was partially offset by softer-than-expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S., due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.
Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter. We experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets where second quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.
At China, specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016.
On the environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our lean activities. Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth.
Looking at research and development. Second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our 4 strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food and reproductive health, including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.
Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points while still funding incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. Second quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million, and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first half 2016 adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. In July, we announced the successful completion of a EUR 500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenure and a 1.875 coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.
We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million as compared to $101 million from the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new 2-year 8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.
Turning to our segment results. For the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6% with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our human health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016 with diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
Second quarter 2016 organic revenue from our diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument plate [indiscernible] expense, highlighted in previous quarters.
In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.
Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gained traction. However, the business overall declined high single-digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.
As expected, organic revenue in our life sciences solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and Informatics franchises.
As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. Organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offering, which grew double-digit in China, but was offset by softer-than-expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving, but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.
Looking at operating segment margins. The results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points, a strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution, all contributed to this performance in the quarter.
Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.
As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.
Looking at our outlook. For the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results. And while we expect the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we're maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

And the third area, I think, is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in environmental combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers.

So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say it's a continual process.

And one of the things we're looking at as we continue to focus on the higher priority areas, we're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings and particularly to the extent that we think, in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification. And so obviously, we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately, if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives. There probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focus a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it, at some point, to take it to the next level.

          Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million. Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers.
Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top line growth targets.
In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on 3 areas: first, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly depreciated solutions resulting in tangible customer value; second, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions; and third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness to advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Turning first to innovating with our customers. A good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in realtime, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.
In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we are successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our integrated capabilities with Perkin and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.
In the fast growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders for clients with HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.
We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. This includes the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Avio 200 helps the lab professionals perform complex multi-elemental inorganic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing.
Additionally, in our research business, we continue to launch new assays with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications throughout the market this year alone.
During Q2, we launched an NGS 3k assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.
We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific (sic) [ BioScience ], a company based in Austin, Texas that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed -- safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.
To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in 4 priority areas. These areas include food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues.
The benefit of this strategy are already paying off. In the second quarter, organic revenue for all 4 of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas, the rate of growth increased sequentially. Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial end markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging.
Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.
Turning to our progress on operational execution. We have experienced excellent gross margin experience -- expansion during the first 2 quarters of this year. Our multi-faceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay-off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements. First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing lean throughout our manufacturing sites.
Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost-effectively.
As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to seek accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and the addressable market. In addition, our one-source business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth in the market.
However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?"

Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year",1353,":  
          Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the second quarter. We continue to be pleased with our operational execution, the success from key lean and indirect spending initiatives that have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver a solid financial results to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66. Overall, the quarter played essentially as expected.
Looking at our end markets. We saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales and strong growth in food. This strength, however, was partially offset by softer-than-expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S., due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.
Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter. We experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets where second quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.
At China, specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016.
On the environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our lean activities. Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth.
Looking at research and development. Second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our 4 strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food and reproductive health, including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.
Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points while still funding incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. Second quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million, and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first half 2016 adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. In July, we announced the successful completion of a EUR 500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenure and a 1.875 coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.
We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million as compared to $101 million from the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new 2-year 8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.
Turning to our segment results. For the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6% with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our human health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016 with diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
Second quarter 2016 organic revenue from our diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument plate [indiscernible] expense, highlighted in previous quarters.
In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.
Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gained traction. However, the business overall declined high single-digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.
As expected, organic revenue in our life sciences solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and Informatics franchises.
As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. Organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offering, which grew double-digit in China, but was offset by softer-than-expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving, but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.
Looking at operating segment margins. The results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points, a strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution, all contributed to this performance in the quarter.
Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.
As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.
Looking at our outlook. For the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results. And while we expect the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we're maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

I think, in the beginning of the year, we highlighted that we are little concerned about there, and I think we said that, that could be down in sort of mid-single digits. We're actually seeing a little bit greater headwind than that. And then, Medical Imaging also, I think, we handicap that, it's sort of down slightly, and we're seeing, again, probably something like high single-digit growth declines there. We did see some offsets, though. China was clearly stronger than we thought, and the majority of diagnostics business was stronger than we thought. But, like I said, on balance, it was a relatively minor impact there. Maybe Andy, you just want to cover that for a second?"

And if you look at the midpoint of the range, which is where we came in, really to get to 4% organic, you kind needed to be slightly north of the midpoint. So in addition, in the quarter, we had a little bit of a tailwind from FX, and it was maybe $1 million. But in order to round out to the 4% versus the 3%, we really needed to be at the high end of the range. But just to kind of be clear, we're talking about $2 million -- a little less than $2 million or about 3/10 of a percentage points, which really swung the difference between 3% and 4%."

And I think we still feel good about that model. What you're seeing in the first half of the year is it sort of 3%, 4% organic growth? We're generating 12% EPS growth.

So our industrial is really around sort of petrochemical, chemical, very -- a little bit of semicon, a little bit oil and gas, but that's sort of the majority of our industrial. And I think, if you recall in the beginning of the year, we were a little concerned not only about the macroeconomic trends but also, in 2015, our industrial grew mid-single digits. So we suspected we're going to have a difficult comp. And so I think we modeled in something with sort of mid-single-digit declines. And as I mentioned previously, we're actually seeing something that's more like high single-digit, low -- high single-, low double-digit declines.

One is I think the overall market is strong and growing. I think a lot of that is just continued awareness and media recognition of some of the issues around food. So clearly, the food companies are investing in that area. I would say the second area is we continue to see significant investments coming out of China. So if you look at the food in China, specifically, that was very strong. And the third area, I think, is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in environmental combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers.

We've been able to integrate the Operetta that obviously uses some sample preparation for the NGS side of things, and we're using chemagen. And so that's been a sort of a great win that sort of move a lot of their capabilities onto the PerkinElmer products. But we still feel on track.

So we continue to see nice progress there. As we've talked about it in the past, we think, to a large extent, our differentiation revolves around not only our sort of capabilities and proven track record but also the analytical capabilities we have with our informatics offering. With regard to contracts, I would say, in any given time, we have a number of contracts that are coming through, and the back half of the year is not any different. So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say it's a continual process. I think we've mentioned in the past that a number of these contracts or, I would say, the majority of the contracts are sort of 3-year tenure. And so in any given quarter, we probably have a couple that are coming to, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to either maintain the ones we have or win the ones we don't."

So I wouldn't be surprised if 2 years from now there's parts of PerkinElmer that probably aren't continue to be part of the portfolio. And one of the things we're looking at as we continue to focus on the higher priority areas, we're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings and particularly to the extent that we think, in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification. And so obviously, we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately, if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives. There probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focus a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it, at some point, to take it to the next level. It probably requires a different owner who will be willing to invest more inorganically in the business."

It has a portfolio of NGS library prep kits that go on both Illumina and Ion Torrent. They're particularly good at nucleic acid isolation and their expertise particularly in increasing enzymatic efficiency. So we like that capability. They also bring some strong capabilities around the food area and in particular, in the area of detection of microbial and industrial contaminants. And we like that portfolio of assets as well. So small deal from a revenue perspective but we're excited about the capabilities that they bring and again, complementary with 2 of the higher-growth areas that we've identified in the past. And we'll continue to look for those types of things. As I've said in the past, my preference would be something a little bigger, but clearly, those capabilities are things that fit nicely into the PerkinElmer portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those.

And so it's a combination of going to our informatics customers and introducing them to OneSource and then vice versa on the OneSource side and then ultimately, to the extent possible, trying to drive some product revenue as well. I would say, to this -- at this point, we're seeing much better cross-selling between informatics and OneSource than we are on the product side, but we'll continue to drive that.

          Okay. And I guess, sort of related. In the past, sometimes when we flip the calendar and get into the early days of the new -- of a new China 5-year plan, there is a pause in demand. Ultimately, this is at least historically been followed by a pretty big ramp-up in demand in areas that are prioritized within the plan. You've looked really well positioned given the focus on a number of things, including, but not limited to, food and water testing as well as increased funding for things or increased focus on things like neonatal testing. I'm just wondering, in the early days, are you hearing or seeing anything that suggests we should be contemplating this dynamic. And is that something you've factored into guidance? Or at this point, are you thinking that things may actually get going in the new 5-year plan a little more smoothly than maybe we've seen the last couple of times?"

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically,",1096,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance year-to-date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million. Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers.
Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top line growth targets.
In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on 3 areas: first, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly depreciated solutions resulting in tangible customer value; second, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain or capture leading share positions; and third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness to advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.
Turning first to innovating with our customers. A good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in realtime, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.
In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we are successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our integrated capabilities with Perkin and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.
In the fast growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders for clients with HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.
We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. This includes the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Avio 200 helps the lab professionals perform complex multi-elemental inorganic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing.
Additionally, in our research business, we continue to launch new assays with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications throughout the market this year alone.
During Q2, we launched an NGS 3k assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.
We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific (sic) [ BioScience ], a company based in Austin, Texas that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed -- safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.
To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in 4 priority areas. These areas include food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues.
The benefit of this strategy are already paying off. In the second quarter, organic revenue for all 4 of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas, the rate of growth increased sequentially. Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial end markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging.
Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.
Turning to our progress on operational execution. We have experienced excellent gross margin experience -- expansion during the first 2 quarters of this year. Our multi-faceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay-off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements. First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing lean throughout our manufacturing sites.
Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost-effectively.
As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to seek accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and the addressable market. In addition, our one-source business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth in the market.
However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?"
268363,373004837,1026517,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook.Star",1353,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results as well as details around our third quarter and full year outlook.
Starting with the second quarter. We continue to be pleased with our operational execution, the success from key lean and indirect spending initiatives that have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver a solid financial results to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66. Overall, the quarter played essentially as expected.
Looking at our end markets. We saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales and strong growth in food. This strength, however, was partially offset by softer-than-expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S., due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.
Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter. We experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets where second quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.
At China, specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016.
On the environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.
As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our lean activities. Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth.
Looking at research and development. Second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our 4 strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food and reproductive health, including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.
Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points while still funding incremental R&D investments.
Looking below the operating line. Second quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million, and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first half 2016 adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. In July, we announced the successful completion of a EUR 500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenure and a 1.875 coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.
We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million as compared to $101 million from the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.
I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new 2-year 8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.
Turning to our segment results. For the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6% with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our human health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016 with diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.
Second quarter 2016 organic revenue from our diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continue to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument plate [indiscernible] expense, highlighted in previous quarters.
In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.
Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gained traction. However, the business overall declined high single-digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.
As expected, organic revenue in our life sciences solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and Informatics franchises.
As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.
Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue. Organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offering, which grew double-digit in China, but was offset by softer-than-expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving, but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.
Looking at operating segment margins. The results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points, a strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution, all contributed to this performance in the quarter.
Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016. We believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.
As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.
Looking at our outlook. For the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results. And while we expect the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we're maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

And the third area, I think, is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in environmental combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers.

I mean, even though it comped against a strong sort of mid-teen growth last year, it continued to grow double digits. So we continue to see nice progress there. As we've talked about it in the past, we think, to a large extent, our differentiation revolves around not only our sort of capabilities and proven track record but also the analytical capabilities we have with our informatics offering. With regard to contracts, I would say, in any given time, we have a number of contracts that are coming through, and the back half of the year is not any different. So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say it's a continual process. I think we've mentioned in the past that a number of these contracts or, I would say, the majority of the contracts are sort of 3-year tenure. And so in any given quarter, we probably have a couple that are coming to, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to either maintain the ones we have or win the ones we don't."

And one of the things we're looking at as we continue to focus on the higher priority areas, we're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings and particularly to the extent that we think, in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification. And so obviously, we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately, if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives. There probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focus a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it, at some point, to take it to the next level.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.During the third quarter, we continuative to",1373,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.
During the third quarter, we continuative to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year. While revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2% and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.
Looking first at our end markets. We were seeing market conditions consistent with what we've experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities, which included reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, any market conditions continue to be challenging. Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had a third quarter last year, as well as more significant headwinds that we expected in Radiochemicals in our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health.
While most of the headwinds are market related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short term. Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continued to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first 9 months.
Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%. Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 and 110 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7% or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.
As we reflect on our third quarter result, we are disappointed by the top line performance, but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review of the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate, as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.
In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position Perkin Elmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customer's requirements.
As of the fourth quarter, diagnostics is now standalone segment and we formed a new segment, Discovery and Analytical Solutions, or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. This new segment have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.
Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully the consolidated our clinical business offerings, which is subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets and infectious disease markets as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in health-care spending each year. Year-to-date, our diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top 10 diagnostic customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our [indiscernible] noninvasive prenatal testing currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.
Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample the sequence and workflow proposition for NGS oppositions.
The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications focus customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalyst for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer-focused, facilitate more value-added collaboration and deliver breakthrough innovations.
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger-than-expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking and we're already seeing early wins from our projects targeting, quality, cost, capacity, cycle time and productivity.
In the quarter, we also are able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures. With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace as offering truly differentiated solutions, an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.
During the third quarter, we held our second Annual Innovation Summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing 2 or more patents over the last 12 months. The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes combined with our commitment to increased R&D spending as a percentage of sales should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.
As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our 4 key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year will be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 9%. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy."
268363,404841931,1078716,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color in the end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.As Rob mentioned, our third quarter",1304,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color in the end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.
As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell shorter da expectations. However, we continue to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins, along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million, representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago. While, year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%. 
Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad-based strength in diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower-than-forecasted academic and government sales at essentially flat industrial revenues. We didn't see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter as well as in medical imaging, which declined double-digit.
Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focus growth areas as we saw a better-than-expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations. In contrast to the strong performances, industrial, academic and government markets have been slower-than-expected experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines with environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical imaging remains challenging and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.
Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened declining mid-single digits in the quarter. Strength in China and India continue with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10%, respectively, in the third quarter with a somewhat performance year-to-date.
We believe our focus and continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies. 
As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong diagnostics and informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter. We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization, with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we've made incremental investments in Lean talent assuming a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.
As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage our operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations giving us increased confidence and our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.
Moving to our operating expenses, we continued to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth and has had a positive impact on a year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restriction activities and indirect initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health.
Overall, we are very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 and 110 basis points, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A, we are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.
Our operating cash flow generation remain strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance, driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.
Turning to our segment results for the third quarter. Human health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, human health organic revenue was up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year. This will be the last quarter we will be reporting our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery and Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.
From a market perspective, our human health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and life sciences solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue. As mentioned earlier, we have strong and broad-based demand across our diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our diagnostics franchises continued to experience healthy growth, led by [indiscernible] blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter.
We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue. As Rob mentioned, our top 10 diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.
Organic revenue in our Life Science solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year was disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter as pharma  and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.
Moving to our environment health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products, analytics in China, and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower-than-expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower-growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our diagnostics business, partially offset by slower-than-forecasted academic and government demand as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And, Amber, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

I would say, first of all, as the quarter played down, I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks, sitting here sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would shift historically durin",332,"Sure. I would say, first of all, as the quarter played down, I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks, sitting here sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would shift historically during a quarter. And again just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded where the service and the reagents in our diagnostic business is more consistent through the quarter. But, clearly, the instrument business is back-end loaded. But again probably second week in September, we were sort of tracking maybe even a tenth better than what we had historically seem to get to sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple of weeks in September, we saw particular in the capital side fairly amount of deferrals or pushbacks, push outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple of weeks of September. So with the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is in talking to some of our customers is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases, unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September. To our point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets, the one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20% and we saw that fairly broad-based. But I would say outside of China, we did see this capital intensive side of the business definitely suffered here as we go to the latter part of September."

How do you kind of handicap where you are in the cycle, when the right time to sell some of these businesses as might be versus trying to improve, I guess, I'm trying to think about your -- a bit more on the capital deployment side and pruning the portfolio side. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about the timing of those actions?"

So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth business while they did grow probably more in the high single-digits, again every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why to some extent, we're trying to look at this over a little bit longer period -- sorry, year-to-date numbers because I think the Q3 is clearly [indiscernible] restored it because of the extra week last year. But I think directionally your comment is correct, where obviously, the growth side of the business is doing very well. And we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business in the sort of more application businesses together, I think it does drive collaboration and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit and the customers a little bit better. But the other aspect of it is, when research and environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive when pruning some of the product lines because as those businesses were separate, we became a little bit of a subscale in areas like front-end and some of the other areas. So we think one of the things that this reorganization does, I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side, in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration the R&D, the manufacturing scale and serving our customers. The other thing, obviously, is we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio, that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it's important for us to get the organizational structure right, it's important to get our operating execution right. So that again as we make the portfolio moves, that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about. However, it's important to make sure that the flow or the sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation execution and then we can start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio."

We obviously, had very strong gross margin and we have a very good SG&A beverage. On the gross margin side, we are seeing an acceleration in maybe slightly faster than we have forecasted going in the quarter from our Lean initiatives. So I think of the upside we saw in the quarter versus our guidance, about 1/3 of that was due to productivity gains. And then the rest of that was really more mixed where we saw high growth in our diagnostics and informatics franchises. On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our [indiscernible] spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of caution, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that. And we also had some favorabilities given the compares to last year with 5 weeks -- or the extra week of cost. But that is probably less so. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever. And I think that was really the primary reason we saw the upside that were forecasted despite the top line decline."

Of course, we mentioned [indiscernible] banking and then, of course, our infectious disease area. So I think you cross those businesses, I think we feel good about.

This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.During the third quarter, we continued to dri",1374,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.
During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year. While revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2% and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.
Looking first at our end markets. We were seeing market conditions consistent with what we've experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities, which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging. Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year, as well as more significant headwinds than expected in Radiochemicals in our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health.
While most of the headwinds are market related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short term. Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first 9 months.
Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%. Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 and 110 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7% or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.
As we reflect on our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top line performance, but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate, as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.
In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.
As of the fourth quarter, diagnostics is now a stand-alone segment and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.
Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully the consolidated our clinical business offerings, which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets and infectious disease markets as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in health care spending each year. Year-to-date, our diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top 10 diagnostic companies -- customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis noninvasive prenatal testing, currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.
Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample-to-sequencer workflow proposition for NGS applications.
The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications focus customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration and deliver breakthrough innovations.
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger-than-expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking and we're already seeing early wins from our projects targeting, quality, cost, capacity, cycle time and productivity.
In the quarter, we also are able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures. With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace as offering truly differentiated solutions, is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.
During the third quarter, we held our second annual Innovation Summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing 2 or more patents over the last 12 months. 
The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes combined with our commitment to increased R&D spending as a percentage of sales should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.
As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macro economic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our 4 key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 9%. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy."

I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.As Rob mentioned, our third quarter",1307,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.
As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations. However, we continued to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins, along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million, representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago. While, year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%. 
Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad-based strength in diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower-than-forecasted academic and government sales and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter as well as in medical imaging, which declined double-digit.
Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focus growth areas as we saw a better-than-expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations. In contrast to these strong performances, industrial, academic and government markets have been slower-than-expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines, with environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical imaging remains challenging and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.
Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter. Strength in China and India continue with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10%, respectively, in the third quarter with a somewhat performance year-to-date.
We believe our focus and continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies. 
As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong diagnostics and informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter. We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization, with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we've made incremental investments in Lean talent assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.
As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.
Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth and has had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restriction activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health.
Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 and 110 basis points, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A. We are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.
Our operating cash flow generation remain strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance, driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.
Turning to our segment results for the third quarter. Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue was up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year. 
This will be the last quarter we will be reporting our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.
From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue. As mentioned earlier, we have strong and broad-based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our diagnostics franchises continued to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter.
We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue. 
As Rob mentioned, our top 10 diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.
Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.
Moving to our Environment Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products, analytics [ph] in China, and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower-than-expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower-growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our diagnostics business, partially offset by slower-than-forecasted academic and government demand as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And, Amber, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions."

I would say, first of all, as the quarter played down, I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks, sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would shift historically during a quarter. And again just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded where the service and the reagents, let's say our diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter. But, clearly, the instrument business is back-end loaded. But again probably second week in September, we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple of weeks of September, we saw, particularly on the capital side, fairly [ph] amount of deferrals or pushbacks, push outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple of weeks of September. So where the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is in talking to some of our customers is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases, unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September. To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets, the one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20% and we saw that fairly broad-based. But I would say outside of China, we did see this capital intensive side of the business definitely suffered here as we got into the latter part of September."

How do you, I guess, kind of handicap where you are in the cycle, when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess, I'm trying to think about your -- you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side than pruning the portfolio side.

Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date.

So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth businesses while they did grow were probably more in the mid- to high single digits, again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why to some extent, we're trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year. But I think directionally your comment is correct, where obviously, the growth side of the business is doing very well. And we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and the sort of more application businesses together, I think it does drive collaboration and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit -- the customers, a little bit better. But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines because as those businesses were separate, we became a little bit of a subscale in areas like front-end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does, I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side, in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing scale and serving our customers. The other thing, obviously, is we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio, that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it's important for us to get the organizational structure right, it was important to get our operating execution right. So that again, as we make the portfolio moves, that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about. Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or the sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation execution and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio."

We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that. And we also had some favorabilities given the compares to last year with the 5 weeks -- or the extra week of costs. But that is probably less so. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever.

I think the service thing we talked about, I think, specifically in food where we have some assets, again it sort ruined the research area, but are also in the historical environmental areas.

We talked about newborn that continues to do well, we continue to see very strong growth on the prenatal or the maternal fetal side. Of course, we mentioned blood banking and then, of course, our infectious disease area. So I think across those businesses, I think we feel good about it. So one of the areas where we're focused on is, we are seeing increased pressure on local manufacturing of products.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.During the third quarter, we continued to dri",1371,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.
During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year. While revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2% and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.
Looking first at our end markets. We're seeing market conditions consistent with what we've experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities, which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging. Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year, as well as the more significant headwinds than expected in Radiochemicals and our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health.
While most of the headwinds are market related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short term. Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first 9 months.
Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%. Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million, resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 and 110 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7% or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.
As we reflect on our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top line performance, but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate, as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.
In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.
As of the fourth quarter, diagnostics is now a stand-alone segment, and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.
Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully consolidated our clinical business offerings, which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets and infectious disease markets as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in health care spending each year. Year-to-date, our diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top 10 diagnostic companies -- customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis noninvasive prenatal testing, currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.
Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample-to-sequencer workflow proposition for NGS applications.
The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications-focused customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration and deliver breakthrough innovations.
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger-than-expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking, and we're already seeing early wins from our projects targeting quality, cost, capacity, cycle time and productivity.
In the quarter, we also were able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures. With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace, as offering truly differentiated solutions is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.
During the third quarter, we held our second annual Innovation Summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing 2 or more patents over the last 12 months. 
The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes combined with our commitment to increased R&D spending as a percentage of sales should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.
As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our 4 key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 9%. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy."

I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.As Rob mentioned, our third quarter",1306,"Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.
As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations. However, we continued to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins, along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million, representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago. While, year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%. 
Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad-based strength in diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower-than-forecasted academic and government sales and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter as well as in medical imaging, which declined double-digit.
Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focused growth areas as we saw better-than-expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations. In contrast to these strong performances, industrial, academic and government markets have been slower-than-expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines, with environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical imaging remains challenging and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.
Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter. Strength in China and India continued with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10%, respectively, in the third quarter with a similar performance year-to-date.
We believe that our focus and continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies. 
As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong diagnostics and informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter. We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization, with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we have made incremental investments in Lean talent, assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.
As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.
Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth, and it's had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restructuring activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health.
Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 and 110 basis points, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A. We are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.
Our operating cash flow generation remained strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance, driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.
Turning to our segment results for the third quarter. Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue is up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year. 
This will be the last quarter we will be reporting our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.
From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue. As mentioned earlier, we had strong and broad-based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our diagnostics franchises continue to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter.
We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue. 
As Rob mentioned, our top 10 diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.
Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year, which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.
Moving to our Environment Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products at analytica China, and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower-than-expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower-growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our diagnostics business, partially offset by slower-than-forecasted academic and government demand as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And, Amber, at this time, we'd like to open up the call to questions."

It sounded like you were talking a little bit more around your growth businesses versus your nongrowth businesses. So can you maybe -- maybe just talk a little about how the quarter, you saw develop? And if there's anything kind of geographic that stood out to you and on the top line?"
268363,404841931,1079005,"PerkinElmer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Revvity, Inc.","Executives","Sure.

So I would say, first of all, as the quarter played out -- and I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks. Sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we were sort of tracking pretty well to what we would ship historically, during a quarter. And again just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded. Where the service and the reagents, let's say our diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter. But, clearly, the instrument business is back-end loaded. But again probably second week in September, we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to the sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple weeks of September, we saw, particularly on the capital side, fairly [ph] amount of deferrals or pushbacks -- push outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple of weeks of September. So where the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is in talking to some of our customers is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September. To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets the one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20% and we saw that fairly broad-based. But I would say outside of China, we did see the capital intensive side of the business definitely suffered here as we got into the latter part of September."

So that means that the other parts of your business, which was a little bit over 50%, would have had to have been down double digits. You're talking about maybe accelerating some of your corporate development initiatives. How do you, I guess, kind of handicap where you are in the cycle, when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess, I'm trying to think about your -- you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side than pruning the portfolio side. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about the timing of those actions?"

Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth businesses while they did grow were probably more in the mid- to high single digits.",438,"Right. So that's a good question. Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth businesses while they did grow were probably more in the mid- to high single digits. Again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why to some extent, we're trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year. But I think directionally your comment is correct, where obviously, the growth side of the business is doing very well. And we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and the sort of more application businesses together. And I think it does drive collaboration, and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit -- the customers, a little bit better. But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines because as those businesses were separate, we became a little bit of a subscale in areas like front-end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does, I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side, in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing, scale and serving our customers. The other thing, obviously, is we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio, that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it was important for us to get the organizational structure right. It was important to get our operating execution right. So that again, as we make the portfolio moves, that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about. Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or the sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation execution and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio."

And then the rest of that was really more mix where we saw high growth in our diagnostics and informatics franchises. On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our indirect spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that. And we also had some favorabilities given the comparison last year with the 5 weeks -- or the extra week of costs. But that was probably less so. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever.

I don't know that I could sort of attribute anything to the release of our 5-year plan. I would say where we've seen it a little bit more is on the research side, in areas like this precision medicine initiative and an increased focus on food. They've come out with some new regulations on food, where they're looking at the entire food chain. I would say there I think we have seen a little bit of an inflection, probably a positive. But diagnostics has been strong, continues to be strong there. And I think we're well-positioned in sort of several facets. We talked about newborn that continues to do well, we continue to see very strong growth on the prenatal or the maternal fetal side. Of course, we mentioned blood banking and then, of course, our infectious disease area. So I think across those businesses, I think we feel good about it. So one of the areas where we're focused on is, we are seeing increased pressure on local manufacturing of products. And I would say, to a large extent, we're in a good position there, but we just want to make sure we continue to have the majority, if not all, of our diagnostic products manufactured locally. So that's a big focus for us to make sure as it becomes more challenging, both from government tenders as well as local competition, that we've got a strong capability to produce everything and fundamentally design everything in China."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.During the third quarter, we continued to dri",1371,"Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, I'd like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.
During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year. While revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2% and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.
Looking first at our end markets. We're seeing market conditions consistent with what we've experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities, which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging. Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year, as well as the more significant headwinds than expected in Radiochemicals and our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health.
While most of the headwinds are market related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short term. Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first 9 months.
Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%. Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million, resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 and 110 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7% or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.
As we reflect on our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top line performance, but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate, as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.
In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.
As of the fourth quarter, diagnostics is now a stand-alone segment, and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.
Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully consolidated our clinical business offerings, which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets and infectious disease markets as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in health care spending each year. Year-to-date, our diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top 10 diagnostic companies -- customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis noninvasive prenatal testing, currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.
Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample-to-sequencer workflow proposition for NGS applications.
The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications-focused customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration and deliver breakthrough innovations.
During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger-than-expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking, and we're already seeing early wins from our projects targeting quality, cost, capacity, cycle time and productivity.
In the quarter, we also were able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures. With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace, as offering truly differentiated solutions is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.
During the third quarter, we held our second annual Innovation Summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing 2 or more patents over the last 12 months. 
The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes combined with our commitment to increased R&D spending as a percentage of sales should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.
As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our 4 key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 9%. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Andy."

I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.
As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations. However, we continued to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins, along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million, representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago. While, year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%. 
Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad-based strength in diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower-than-forecasted academic and government sales and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter as well as in medical imaging, which declined double-digit.
Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focused growth areas as we saw better-than-expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations. In contrast to these strong performances, industrial, academic and government markets have been slower-than-expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines, with environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical imaging remains challenging and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.
Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter. Strength in China and India continued with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10%, respectively, in the third quarter with a similar performance year-to-date.
We believe that our focus and continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies. 
As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong diagnostics and informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter. We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization, with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we have made incremental investments in Lean talent, assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.
As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.
Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth, and it's had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restructuring activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health.
Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 and 110 basis points, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A. We are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.
Our operating cash flow generation remained strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance, driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.
Turning to our segment results for the third quarter. Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue is up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year. 
This will be the last quarter we will be reporting our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.
From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue. As mentioned earlier, we had strong and broad-based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our diagnostics franchises continue to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter.
We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue. 
As Rob mentioned, our top 10 diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.
Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year, which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.
Moving to our Environment Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products at analytica China, and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower-than-expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower-growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our diagnostics business, partially offset by slower-than-forecasted academic and government demand as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.
This concludes my prepared remarks. And, Amber, at this time, we'd like to open up the call to questions."

It sounded like you were talking a little bit more around your growth businesses versus your nongrowth businesses. So can you maybe -- maybe just talk a little about how the quarter, you saw develop?

So I would say, first of all, as the quarter played out -- and I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks. Sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we were sort of tracking pretty well to what we would ship historically, during a quarter. And again just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded. Where the service and the reagents, let's say our diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter. But, clearly, the instrument business is back-end loaded. But again probably second week in September, we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to the sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple weeks of September, we saw, particularly on the capital side, fairly [ph] amount of deferrals or pushbacks -- push outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple of weeks of September. So where the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is in talking to some of our customers is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September. To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets the one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20% and we saw that fairly broad-based. But I would say outside of China, we did see the capital intensive side of the business definitely suffered here as we got into the latter part of September."

You're talking about maybe accelerating some of your corporate development initiatives. How do you, I guess, kind of handicap where you are in the cycle, when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess, I'm trying to think about your -- you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side than pruning the portfolio side. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about the timing of those actions?"

Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth businesses while they did grow were probably more in the mid- to high single digits.",438,"Right. So that's a good question. Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so the growth businesses while they did grow were probably more in the mid- to high single digits. Again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why to some extent, we're trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year. But I think directionally your comment is correct, where obviously, the growth side of the business is doing very well. And we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and the sort of more application businesses together. And I think it does drive collaboration, and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit -- the customers, a little bit better. But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines because as those businesses were separate, we became a little bit of a subscale in areas like front-end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does, I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side, in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing, scale and serving our customers. The other thing, obviously, is we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio, that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it was important for us to get the organizational structure right. It was important to get our operating execution right. So that again, as we make the portfolio moves, that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about. Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or the sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation execution and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio."

So I think of the upside we saw in the quarter versus our guidance, about 1/3 of that was due to productivity gains. And then the rest of that was really more mix where we saw high growth in our diagnostics and informatics franchises. On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our indirect spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that. And we also had some favorabilities given the comparison last year with the 5 weeks -- or the extra week of costs. But that was probably less so. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever.

I would say if you looked back a couple -- maybe a year or 2 ago, it was either 2 or 4. We are starting to see certain areas, like particularly around Shanghai and a couple of the large cities, start to implement mass spec. So we have seen a ramp-up in almost sort of a bifurcation. You still, out in the West, continue to see in the sort of 2 to 4 area. But on the East, and particularly in the large cities, you are starting to see menus now get up to sort of 15 to 20. But I would say, on average in China right now, we're probably 6 or 7. But there is sort of a movement into higher menus. In the U.S. right now, the standard of care is 29. As you may know, we're probably on an average in the States in the sort of low-40s. And then if you look in India right now, we're only testing right now, we've got 4 pilot programs, 2 of those pilot programs have moved into actual full-fledged programs. And to the most extent they're, most of those 4, they're in the sort of 4 to 6 range as far as the menu. So it varies a fair amount. Obviously, U.S. is by far the highest number."
