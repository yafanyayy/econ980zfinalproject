I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio and a more resilient balance sheet.

I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio and a more resilient balance sheet. This performance is the outcome of our work to instill greater discipline on how we manage our business, to make value our watchword and to drive accountability deeper into the organization. While economic growth and metal prices were generally subdued in 2015, we made measurable progress on our strategy to become the world's leading gold business by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to cost, strengthening our portfolio and creating value by funding our highest margin projects, reducing debt and paying steady dividends. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for the highlights, starting at our operations. Last year, we lowered injury rates by 18%, with the lowest in the mining sector. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining costs by 10%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of keeping them below $1,000 per ounce. And we increased gold production to 5 million ounces and copper production to 166,000 tonnes on an attributable basis. 
Moving to our portfolio, we acquired Cripple Creek and Victor, a cash flowing asset in a favorable jurisdiction, and progressed the new Leach pad and mill. We divested noncore assets, including Waihi and our stake in Valcambi, bringing total asset proceeds to $1.7 billion since 2013. And we completed the Turf Vent Shaft on time and under budget, giving us access to higher grades and a platform to expand the Leeville mine. We advanced Merian, where we lowered capital from our most recent guidance by another $50 [ph] million and remain on track to begin commercial production later this year. We reached a decision to fund the first phase of Long Canyon in Nevada and an expansion at Tanami in Australia. And we've added 5 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We increased our adjusted EBITDA by 29% to $2.7 billion despite a 9% decrease in realized gold price. We more than doubled free cash flows to $756 million, reduced net debt by 19%, while continuing to invest in growth and paid $52 million in dividends and delivered first quartile total shareholder returns versus our competitors. 
Our sustainability performance also influences our ability to create value. Turning to Slide 5. In 2015, Newmont sustainability performance was rated best of the mining industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also ranked first in the areas of climate strategy and environmental management, labor practice and human rights and corporate citizenship. While it's hard to put a dollar value on sustainability, it's clear that superior performance is a prerequisite for managing long-term cost and risk and maintaining the social acceptance we need to operate. The most important way we measure sustainability is by how well the look after our people. Our goal is to send everyone home safely everyday. We're making progress by continually lowering injury rates and we achieved more than 400 days of 0 harm at a team, but this performance is overshadowed by the loss of 2 colleagues in 2015. Our work to improve safety and productivity will never end. 
Turning to operational performance on Slide 6. In 2015, we lowered our gold all-in sustaining cost for the fourth year in a row, ending below $900 per ounce. This represents a reduction of 24% over the last 3 years. Our Full Potential program has been a central force in improving our performance and our competitive position since it was launched in late 2012. To date, we've delivered more than $1 billion in improvements against the 2012 baseline and consistently exceeded our targets. We've launched the second phase of this program at about half our operations with the remainder scheduled in 2016. 
Better technical practices are also driving improved reliability. We can't control metal prices, but we have been able to narrow the gap between estimated and actual tonnages and grades, metallurgical recoveries, cost and productivity through more predictable orebody modeling. Finally, we benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates in 2015, which accounted for about 60% of our overall cost improvements. 
Turning to portfolio improvements on Slide 7. Our goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risks we are well equipped to manage. We have optimize our portfolio over the last 3 years and you can see the results of our efforts on this slide. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we're able to increase mine life by about 2/3, lower cost by nearly 20% and lower technical and social risk. I'll take a minute now to walk you through what we're doing to manage risk and make the most of our opportunities in each of our regions. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft was completed in November and is now delivering better air circulation and design capacity. The ventilation is so good, in fact, that people are wearing coats in the Leeville underground mine. The team has fine-tuned ground control plans at Leeville and is currently evaluating alternative mining methods. Production and cost were negatively impacted by a geotechnical challenges in the fourth quarter and we expect that trend to reverse in the second half of 2016. We started mining at Long Canyon and remain on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. Finally, we're making good headway with the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. Leach pad construction is slightly ahead of schedule, with first production expected in the second quarter. Mill availability has also improved following a scheduled shutdown in December and further improvements are expected in the first half 2016. 
Turning to South America. Surinam, Merian is about 2/3 complete, and I'll talk more about that later. In Peru, we're studying a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits and we have more to tell you in the second half of the year. I also want to touch on the reclassification of Congo reserves to resources. This was triggered by certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015 and uncertain prospects for future development and permitting. We do not anticipate development of Congo for the foreseeable future. 
In Africa, we have secured a new investment agreement and built permanent energy capacity in Ghana, both of which create the stability necessary for long-term investment. The Tanami -- moving on to Asia-Pacific, the Tanami Expansion project is on track, with a second decline well underway and mill expansion construction beginning in mid-2016. Additional production is expected to come online in 2017. In Indonesia, we received our export permit about 2 months late and the delay affected our sales revenue in the fourth quarter. I also want to address speculation about the potential sale of Batu Hijau. Newmont, with our partner, Sumitomo, are in discussions with certain partners who've expressed serious interest, but to date, none has secured fully-committed financing or final deal terms. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
Before I hand over to Laurie, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer, for playing a leading role in creating safer and more efficient operations and a stronger portfolio and project pipeline over the past 3 years. As Chris retires on May 1, we have an exceptional leader in Tom Palmer taking his place. I've known Tom for more than 15 years. He has a long track record of improving operational performance as he did over the past 2 years at our Asia-Pacific business, and we share a strong commitment to safety and productivity and to building the next generation of profitable new mines. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights.

Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights. With the full year, gold cost applicable to sales and a gold all-in sustaining costs were both down 10% compared to 2014 and finished below the midpoint of our guidance. Likewise, gold production was up 4% and above the midpoint of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, gold production was strong and roughly in line with the prior-year quarter. As expected, costs were higher than the previous 3 quarters. Gold cash in all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 8% unfavorable to the prior-year quarter due primarily to lower mill grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo. Consistent with our guidance, cash is expected to improve by the second half of 2016 as we ramp up production at CC&V and Merian reaches commercial production. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We delivered over $750 million of consolidated free cash flow in 2015 and generated a 49% improvement in cash from continuing operations despite the 9% drop in the gold price. Our adjusted net income for the year was $507 million or $0.98 per share. And I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was up 29% from the prior year, benefiting from strong copper and gold sales volume and lower cost applicable to sales. Turning to the fourth quarter results, adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was strong, but lower than the prior-year quarter due to lower metal pricing. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow and existing cash balances. 
Last week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price link dividend guidelines. 
Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our quarterly GAAP net income include a $0.25 tax adjustment. The majority of this relates to tax restructuring and acquisitions and divestitures, and $0.18 noncash reclamation charge at one of Newmont's legacy sites. This accrual adjustment is for liabilities that will be spent over many years into the future, a $0.03 onetime payment related to prior-period royalties from the revised Ghana investment agreement and a $0.06 impairment of other long-lived assets and marketable securities. After adjusting for these items, we reported net income of $20 million or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was also impacted by the noncash reclamation charge, the revised Ghana investment agreement and asset impairment. In other words, the same items, except for taxes, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $466 million for the quarter. 
Now turning to our capital priorities in Slide 13. We delivered a step change in financial flexibility and maintained our investment-grade balance sheet despite, lower metal pricing through a disciplined approach to project development and capital allocation. In 2015, we generated about $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. After sustaining capital, cash from core operations totaled $1.4 billion. At the end of the year, we also had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a 16% improvement from 2014. This includes 2015 net cash from divestitures of about $200 million. 
Our strong cash flow and total liquidity position of over $6 billion support our capital priorities of funding profitable projects, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. As you can see, during the year, we spent $655 million on development capital, repaid $454 million of debt and paid $52 million in dividends. Free cash flow was negative for the fourth quarter primarily due to timing of development capital spend for Merian and Long Canyon. We had a positive cash from core operations of $27 million in the quarter, which didn't cover our Q4 development capital of just over $200 million. It's worth pointing out again that we continue to expect positive free cash flow on an annual basis, but we may not see it every quarter due to timing of development capital expenditures for our growth projects. As I noted earlier, our cash flow from core operations more than covered development capital, debt pay down and dividends for the year. 
We're very pleased with the progress we've made in strapping our balance sheet during 2015, including $120 million of debt repayment in Q4. In light of our strong 2015 financial and operating performance and the current gold price environment, we will evaluate options to further reduce gross debt over the coming months. 
Slide 14 demonstrates that our discipline has transformed our balance sheet into one of the healthiest in the sector. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.3 is among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 19% since 2014 and continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x at $1,200 gold. This metric may turn higher at lower pricing, but over time, these levels allow us to maintain investment-grade metrics across cycles. We work with the rating agencies and talk to them frequently to ensure they understand our strategy and results. S&P removed the negative outlook on our BBB rating in June. They also revised their liquidity assessment from strong to exceptional. Moody's recently place Newmont and many other metals and mining companies on review. They did this across the board primarily because of their outlook for commodities pricing and their desire to deliver a review against that pricing deck. In general, the agencies have been very positive about the operating and financial improvements at Newmont. 
And with that,, I'll hand it back to Gary."

Let's shift gears to the future starting on Slide 16. Our goal is to continue improving our performance and prospects by delivering safe and profitable production, adding higher-margin ounces and advancing our best projects, generating the strong returns we need to invest in growth, reduce debt and fund dividends and maintaining leading sustainability and governance practices. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Our outlook has not changed, with the exception of the improvement in forecast capital spend at Merian, which I mentioned earlier. We expect to sustain the savings we've achieved today through efficient operations, optimized projects and value-accretive transactions and to maintain gold all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce through 2020. Over the next 2 years, costs are expected to benefit from higher-margin ounces at Merian, Cripple Creek and Victor, Tanami and Long Canyon, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity cost of capital improvements. Potential upside includes further potential -- full potential savings and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been approved. 
Turning to production on Slide 18. We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016. Production is then forecast to rise in 2017 as new projects come online. After that, we expect profitable production of at least 4.5 million to 5 million ounces through 2020. In the near term, higher-margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha and South America. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek and Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin's surface mines and Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside. The team in Ghana's is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly-prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, Asia-Pacific will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and a higher stripping at Boddington. 
Turning to capital on Slide 19. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures over the near term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. Sustaining capital is expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital in 2016 and '17 will support our current projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at Cripple Creek and Victor and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next profitable growth opportunities. 
Turning to our project pipeline on Slide 20. Projects in the execution phase are progressing on schedule and at or below budget. To recap, Long Canyon is more than 45% complete and we began mining in January. The Cripple Creek and Victor expansion is on track and the team is evaluating promising options for concentrate processing. Merian was 66% complete at the end of January, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. And the second decline at Tanami is nearing completion and we will begin mill expansion construction in the coming months. 
Turning to projects that will be up for funding review in 2016. The Ahafo mill expansion is decide to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. Finally, the next cut back at Batu Hijau, Phase 7, represents good returns but require significant investment. We will not move forward with Phase 7 until we've secured an amended Contract of Work at project financing. 
Turning to our reserves on Slide 21. We added 5 million ounces our gold reserves by the drill bit in 2015 and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek and Victor. Additions included higher grade ounces at key underground lines, including 1 million ounces at Carlin and 800,000 ounces that Tanami, more than doubling reserves at the Subika underground mine with the addition of 800,000 ounces and extending the life of KCGM by adding 1.1 million equity ounces, and at Yanacocha by converting 700,000 ounces at [indiscernible]. These additions helped offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces, divestment of 800,000 ounces, which included Waihi, price-related changes of 3 million ounces, largely due to moving on economically marginal layback at the team, which is not included in the current mine plan to resources, and net negative provisions of 700,000 ounces primarily at Ahafo and Ahafo North. The strength of our gold reserves is reflected in slightly higher average year-end gold grades of 1.06 grams per tonne and reduced sensitivity to lower gold prices. We lowered our reserve price to $1,200 per ounce at the end of 2015. Operational and portfolio improvements, combined with favorable exchange rates, have reduced the downside sensitivity of a further $100 decrease in gold price to less than half of what it was last year. 
Turning to Slide 22. In the near term, we expect a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth the constraint prices. In the medium term, supply is expected to decrease due to aging ore bodies, slower project development and fewer new discoveries. These factors, combined with rising demand from emerging market consumers, support a positive outlook for gold prices in the years to come. In the meantime, we're preparing for all scenarios. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plan. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we'd expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new products, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost in capital, fund projects and exploration prospects that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy. 
Summing it all up on Slide 24. We're proud of what we've accomplished in 2015, but our sites are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to what of the safest among all industries. Taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline and maintaining leading social, environmental and governance practices and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.

I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio and a more resilient balance sheet. This performance is the outcome of our work to instill greater discipline and how we manage our business, to make value our watchword and to drive accountability deeper into the organization. While economic growth and metal prices were generally subdued in 2015, we made measurable progress on our strategy to become the world's leading gold business by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to cost, strengthening our portfolio and creating value by funding our highest margin projects, reducing debt and paying steady dividends. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for the highlights, starting at our operations. Last year, we lowered injury rates by 18% to among the lowest in the mining sector. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by 10%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of keeping them below $1,000 per ounce. And we increased gold production to 5 million ounces and copper production to 166,000 tonnes on an attributable basis.
Moving to our portfolio, we acquired Cripple Creek & Victor, a cash flowing asset in a favorable jurisdiction, and progressed the new leach pad and mill. We divested noncore assets, including Waihi and our stake in Valcambi, bringing total asset proceeds to $1.7 billion since 2013. And we completed the Turf Vent Shaft on time and under budget, giving us access to higher grades and a platform to expand the Leeville mine. We advanced Merian, where we lowered capital from our most recent guidance by another $50 million and remain on track to begin commercial production later this year. We reached a decision to fund the first phase of Long Canyon in Nevada and then expansion at Tanami in Australia. And we've added 5 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We increased our adjusted EBITDA by 29% to $2.7 billion despite a 9% decrease in realized gold price. We more than doubled free cash flows to $756 million, reduced net debt by 19%, while continuing to invest in growth and paid $52 million in dividends and delivered first quartile total shareholder returns versus our competitors.  Our sustainability performance also influences our ability to create value. 
Turning to Slide 5. In 2015, Newmont sustainability performance was rated best in the mining industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also ranked first in the areas of climate strategy and environmental management, labor practices and human rights and corporate citizenship. While it's hard to put a dollar value on sustainability, it's clear that superior performance is a prerequisite for managing long-term costs and risk and maintaining the social acceptance we need to operate. The most important way we measure sustainability is by how well we look after our people. Our goal is to send everyone home safely everyday. We're making progress by continually lowering injury rates and we achieved more than 400 days of 0 harm at a team, but this performance has overshadowed by the loss of 2 colleagues in 2015. Our work to improve safety and productivity will never end.
Turning to operational performance on Slide 6. In 2015, we lowered our gold all-in sustaining cost for the fourth year in a row, ending below $900 per ounce. This represents a reduction of 24% over the last 3 years. Our Full Potential program has been a central force in improving our performance and our competitive position since it was launched in late 2012. To date, we've delivered more than $1 billion in improvements against the 2012 baseline and consistently exceeded our targets. We've launched the second phase of this program at about half our operations with the remainder scheduled in 2016.
Better technical practices are also driving improved reliability. We can't control metal prices, but we have been able to narrow the gap between estimated and actual tonnages and grades, metallurgical recoveries, cost and productivity through more predictable orebody modeling. Finally, we benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates in 2015, which accounted for about 60% of our overall cost improvements.
Turning to portfolio improvements on Slide 7. Our goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risks we are well equipped to manage. We have optimized our portfolio over the last 3 years and you can see the results of our efforts on this slide. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we're able to increase mine life by about 2/3, lower cost by nearly 20% and lower technical and social risk. I'll take a minute now to walk you through what we're doing to manage risk and make the most of our opportunities in each of our regions.
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft was completed in November and is now delivering better air circulation and design capacity. The ventilation is so good, in fact, that people are wearing coats in the Leeville underground mine. The team has fine-tuned ground control plans at Leeville and is currently evaluating alternative mining methods. Production and cost were negatively impacted by geotechnical challenges in the fourth quarter and we expect that trend to reverse in the second half of 2016. We started mining at Long Canyon and remain on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. Finally, we're making good headway with the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. Leach pad construction is slightly ahead of schedule with first production expected in the second quarter. Mill availability has also improved following a scheduled shutdown in December and further improvements are expected in the first half of 2016.
Turning to South America. Suriname Merian is about 2/3 complete, and I'll talk more about that later. In Peru, we're studying a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits and we have more to tell you in the second half of the year. I also want to touch on the reclassification of Congo reserves to resources. This was triggered by certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015 and uncertain prospects for future development and permitting. We do not anticipate development of Congo for the foreseeable future.
In Africa, we have secured a new investment agreement and built permanent energy capacity in Ghana, both of which create the stability necessary for long-term investment. The Tanami -- moving on to Asia-Pacific, the Tanami Expansion project is on track with a second decline well underway and mill expansion construction beginning in mid-2016. Additional production is expected to come online in 2017. In Indonesia, we received our export permit about 2 months late and the delay affected our sales revenue in the fourth quarter. I also want to address speculation about the potential sale of Batu Hijau. Newmont, with our partner, Sumitomo, are in discussions with certain parties, who've expressed serious interest, but to date, none has secured fully-committed financing or final deal terms. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
Before I hand over to Laurie, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer for playing a leading role in creating safer and more efficient operations and a stronger portfolio and project pipeline over the past 3 years. As Chris retires on May 1, we have an exceptional leader and Tom Palmer taking his place. I've known Tom for more than 15 years. He has a long track record of improving operational performance as he did over the past 2 years at our Asia-Pacific business, and we share a strong commitment to safety and productivity and to building the next generation of profitable new mines.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights. With the full year, gold cost applicable to sales and gold all-in",931,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was a strong year for Newmont, both operationally and financially. Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights. With the full year, gold cost applicable to sales and gold all-in sustaining cost were both down 10% compared to 2014 and finished below the midpoint of our guidance. Likewise, gold production was up 4% and above the midpoint of our guidance. 
For the fourth quarter, gold production was strong and roughly in line with the prior year quarter. As expected, costs were higher than the previous 3 quarters. Gold CAS and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 8% unfavorable to the prior year quarter due primarily to lower mill grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo. Consistent with our guidance, CAS is expected to improve by the second half of 2016 as we ramp up production at CC&V and Merian reaches commercial production. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We delivered over $750 million of consolidated free cash flow in 2015 and generated a 49% improvement in cash from continuing operations despite the 9% drop in the gold price. Our adjusted net income for the year was $507 million or $0.98 per share. And I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was up 29% from the prior year, benefiting from strong copper and gold sales volume and lower cost applicable to sales. 
Turning to the fourth quarter results, adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was strong, but lower than the prior year quarter due to lower metal pricing. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow and existing cash balances.  Last week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share in line with our gold price link dividend guidelines.
Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our quarterly GAAP net income include a $0.25 tax adjustment. The majority of this relates to tax restructuring and acquisitions and divestitures, an $0.18 noncash reclamation charge at one of Newmont's legacy sites. This accrual adjustment is for liabilities that will be spent over many years into the future. A $0.03 onetime payment related to prior period royalties from the revised Ghana investment agreement and a $0.06 impairment of other long-lived assets and marketable securities. After adjusting for these items, we reported net income of $20 million or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was also impacted by the noncash reclamation charge, the revised Ghana investment agreement and asset impairment. In other words, the same items, except for taxes, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $466 million for the quarter. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 13. We've delivered a step change in financial flexibility and maintained our investment-grade balance sheet despite lower metal pricing through a disciplined approach to project development and capital allocation. In 2015, we generated about $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. After sustaining capital, cash from core operations totaled $1.4 billion. At the end of the year, we also had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a 16% improvement from 2014. This includes 2015 net cash from divestitures of about $200 million. 
Our strong cash flow and total liquidity position of over $6 billion support our capital priorities of funding profitable projects, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. As you can see, during the year, we spent $655 million on development capital, repaid $454 million of debt and paid $52 million in dividends. Free cash flow was negative for the fourth quarter primarily due to timing of development capital spend for Merian and Long Canyon. We had positive cash from core operations of $27 million in the quarter, which didn't cover our Q4 development capital of just over $200 million. It's worth pointing out again that we continue to expect positive free cash flow on an annual basis, but we may not see it every quarter due to timing of development capital expenditures for our growth projects. As I noted earlier, our cash flow from core operations more than covered development capital, debt pay down and dividends for the year.
We're very pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet during 2015, including $120 million of debt repayment in Q4. In light of our strong 2015 financial and operating performance and the current gold price environment, we will evaluate options to further reduce gross debt over the coming months. 
Slide 14 demonstrates that our discipline has transformed our balance sheet into one of the healthiest in the sector. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.3 is among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 19% since 2014 and continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x at $1,200 gold. This metric may turn higher at lower pricing, but over time, these levels allow us to maintain investment-grade metrics across cycles. We work with the rating agencies and talk to them frequently to ensure they understand our strategy and results. S&P removed the negative outlook on our BBB rating in June. They also revised their liquidity assessment from strong to exceptional. Moody's recently placed Newmont and many other metals and mining companies on review. They did this across the board primarily because of their outlook for commodities pricing and their desire to do a review against that pricing deck. In general, the agencies have been very positive about the operating and financial improvements at Newmont. 
And with that,, I'll hand it back to Gary."

Let's shift gears to the future starting on Slide 16. Our goal is to continue improving our performance and prospects by delivering safe and profitable production, adding higher margin ounces and advancing our best projects, generating the strong returns we need to invest in growth, reduce debt and fund dividends and maintaining leading sustainability and governance practices.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Our outlook has not changed with the exception of the improvement in forecast capital spend at Merian, which I mentioned earlier. We expect to sustain the savings we've achieved today through efficient operations, optimized projects and value-accretive transactions and to maintain gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce through 2020. Over the next 2 years, costs are expected to benefit from higher margin ounces at Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami and Long Canyon, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity cost and capital improvements. Potential upside includes further potential -- full potential savings and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been approved.
Turning to production on Slide 18. We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016. Production is then forecast to rise in 2017 as new projects come online. After that, we expect profitable production of at least 4.5 million to 5 million ounces through 2020. In the near term, higher margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha in South America. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin's surface mines and Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, Asia-Pacific will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and a higher stripping at Boddington. 
Turning to capital on Slide 19. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures over the near term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. Sustaining capital is expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital in 2016 and '17 will support our current projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next profitable growth opportunities. 
Turning to our project pipeline on Slide 20. Projects in the execution phase are progressing on schedule and at or below budget. To recap, Long Canyon is more than 45% complete and we began mining in January. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is on track and the team is evaluating promising options for concentrate processing. Merian was 66% complete at the end of January, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. And the second decline at Tanami is nearing completion and we will begin mill expansion construction in the coming months.
Turning to projects that will be up for funding review in 2016. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. Finally, the next cut back at Batu Hijau, Phase 7, represents good returns, but require significant investment. We will not move forward with Phase 7 until we've secured an amended Contract of Work and project financing.
Turning to our reserves on Slide 21. We added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit in 2015 and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. Additions included higher grade ounces at key underground mines, including 1 million ounces at Carlin and 800,000 ounces at Tanami, more than doubling reserves at the Subika underground mine with the addition of 800,000 ounces and extending the life of KCGM by adding 1.1 million equity ounces, and at Yanacocha by converting 700,000 ounces at Quecher Main. These additions help offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces, divestment of 800,000 ounces, which included Waihi, price-related changes of 3 million ounces, largely due to moving an economically marginal layback at a team do not included in the current mine plan to resources, and net negative revisions of 700,000 ounces primarily at Ahafo and Ahafo North. The strength of our gold reserves is reflected in slightly higher average year-end gold grades of 1.06 grams per tonne and reduced sensitivity to lower gold prices. We lowered our reserve price to $1,200 per ounce at the end of 2015. Operational and portfolio improvements, combined with favorable exchange rates, have reduced the downside sensitivity of a further $100 decrease in gold price to less than half of what it was last year.
Turning to Slide 22. In the near term, we expect a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth to constrain prices. In the medium term, supply is expected to decrease due to aging ore bodies, slower project development and fewer new discoveries. These factors, combined with rising demand from emerging market consumers, support a positive outlook for gold prices in the years to come. In the meantime, we're preparing for all scenarios.
Turning to Slide 23. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we'd expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost in capital, fund projects and exploration prospects that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy.
Summing it all up on Slide 24. We're proud of what we've accomplished in 2015, but our sites are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to one of the safest among all industries. Taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline and maintaining leading social, environmental and governance practices and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.

I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio and a more resilient balance sheet. This performance is the outcome of our work to instill greater discipline in how we manage our business, to make value our watchword and to drive accountability deeper into the organization. While economic growth and metal prices were generally subdued in 2015, we made measurable progress on our strategy to become the world's leading gold business by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to cost, strengthening our portfolio and creating value by funding our highest margin projects, reducing debt and paying steady dividends. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for the highlights, starting at our operations. Last year, we lowered injury rates by 18% to among the lowest in the mining sector. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by 10%, marking 6 consecutive quarters of keeping them below $1,000 per ounce. And we increased gold production to 5 million ounces and copper production to 166,000 tonnes on an attributable basis.
Moving to our portfolio, we acquired Cripple Creek & Victor, a cash flowing asset in a favorable jurisdiction, and progressed the new leach pad and mill. We divested noncore assets, including Waihi and our stake in Valcambi, bringing total asset proceeds to $1.7 billion since 2013. And we completed the Turf Vent Shaft on time and under budget, giving us access to higher grades and a platform to expand the Leeville mine. We advanced Merian, where we lowered capital from our most recent guidance by another $50 million and remain on track to begin commercial production later this year. We reached a decision to fund the first phase of Long Canyon in Nevada and an expansion at Tanami in Australia. And we've added 5 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We increased our adjusted EBITDA by 29% to $2.7 billion despite a 9% decrease in realized gold price. We more than doubled free cash flows to $756 million, reduced net debt by 19%, while continuing to invest in growth and paid $52 million in dividends and delivered first quartile total shareholder returns versus our competitors.  Our sustainability performance also influences our ability to create value. 
Turning to Slide 5. In 2015, Newmont sustainability performance was rated best in the mining industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also ranked first in the areas of climate strategy and environmental management, labor practices and human rights and corporate citizenship. While it's hard to put a dollar value on sustainability, it's clear that superior performance is a prerequisite for managing long-term costs and risk and maintaining the social acceptance we need to operate. The most important way we measure sustainability is by how well we look after our people. Our goal is to send everyone home safely every day. We're making progress by continually lowering injury rates and we achieved more than 400 days of 0 harm at Achim, but this performance has overshadowed by the loss of 2 colleagues in 2015. Our work to improve safety and productivity will never end.
Turning to operational performance on Slide 6. In 2015, we lowered our gold all-in sustaining cost for the fourth year in a row, ending below $900 per ounce. This represents a reduction of 24% over the last 3 years. Our Full Potential program has been a central force in improving our performance and our competitive position since it was launched in late 2012. To date, we've delivered more than $1 billion in improvements against the 2012 baseline and consistently exceeded our targets. We've launched the second phase of this program at about half our operations with the remainder scheduled in 2016.
Better technical practices are also driving improved reliability. We can't control metal prices, but we have been able to narrow the gap between estimated and actual tonnages and grades, metallurgical recoveries, cost and productivity through more predictable orebody modeling. Finally, we benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates in 2015, which accounted for about 60% of our overall cost improvements.
Turning to portfolio improvements on Slide 7. Our goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risks we are well equipped to manage. We have optimized our portfolio over the last 3 years and you can see the results of our efforts on this slide. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we're able to increase mine life by about 2/3, lower cost by nearly 20% and lower technical and social risk. I'll take a minute now to walk you through what we're doing to manage risk and make the most of our opportunities in each of our regions.
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft was completed in November and is now delivering better air circulation and design capacity. The ventilation is so good, in fact, that people are wearing coats in the Leeville underground mine. The team has fine-tuned ground control plans at Leeville and is currently evaluating alternative mining methods. Production and cost were negatively impacted by geotechnical challenges in the fourth quarter and we expect that trend to reverse in the second half of 2016. We started mining at Long Canyon and remain on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. Finally, we're making good headway with the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. Leach pad construction is slightly ahead of schedule with first production expected in the second quarter. Mill availability has also improved following a scheduled shutdown in December and further improvements are expected in the first half of 2016.
Turning to South America. Suriname Merian is about 2/3 complete, and I'll talk more about that later. In Peru, we're studying a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits and we’ll have more to tell you in the second half of the year. I also want to touch on the reclassification of Conga reserves to resources. This was triggered by certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015 and uncertain prospects for future development and permitting. We do not anticipate development of Conga for the foreseeable future.
In Africa, we have secured a new investment agreement and built permanent energy capacity in Ghana, both of which create the stability necessary for long-term investment. The Tanami -- moving on to Asia-Pacific, the Tanami Expansion project is on track with a second decline well under way and mill expansion construction beginning in mid-2016. Additional production is expected to come online in 2017. In Indonesia, we received our export permit about 2 months late and the delay affected our sales revenue in the fourth quarter. I also want to address speculation about the potential sale of Batu Hijau. Newmont, with our partner, Sumitomo, are in discussions with certain parties who've expressed serious interest, but to date, none has secured fully committed financing or final deal terms. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
Before I hand over to Laurie, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer for playing a leading role in creating safer and more efficient operations and a stronger portfolio and project pipeline over the past 3 years. As Chris retires on May 1, we have an exceptional leader in Tom Palmer taking his place. I've known Tom for more than 15 years. He has a long track record of improving operational performance as he did over the past 2 years at our Asia-Pacific business, and we share a strong commitment to safety and productivity and to building the next generation of profitable new mines.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."
291795,321582062,935854,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was a strong year for Newmont, both operationally and financially. Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights. For the full year, gold cost applicable to sales and gold all-in s",930,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was a strong year for Newmont, both operationally and financially. Let's turn to Slide 10 to review the financial highlights. For the full year, gold cost applicable to sales and gold all-in sustaining cost were both down 10% compared to 2014 and finished below the midpoint of our guidance. Likewise, gold production was up 4% and above the midpoint of our guidance. 
For the fourth quarter, gold production was strong and roughly in line with the prior year quarter. As expected, costs were higher than the previous 3 quarters. Gold CAS and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 8% unfavorable to the prior year quarter due primarily to lower mill grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo. Consistent with our guidance, CAS is expected to improve by the second half of 2016 as we ramp up production at CC&V and Merian reaches commercial production. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We delivered over $750 million of consolidated free cash flow in 2015 and generated a 49% improvement in cash from continuing operations despite the 9% drop in the gold price. Our adjusted net income for the year was $507 million or $0.98 per share. And I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was up 29% from the prior year, benefiting from strong copper and gold sales volume and lower cost applicable to sales. 
Turning to the fourth quarter results, adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was strong, but lower than the prior year quarter due to lower metal pricing. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow and existing cash balances.  Last week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price link dividend guidelines.
Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our quarterly GAAP net income include a $0.25 tax adjustment. The majority of this relates to tax restructuring and acquisitions and divestitures. An $0.18 noncash reclamation charge at one of Newmont's legacy sites. This accrual adjustment is for liabilities that will be spent over many years into the future. A $0.03 onetime payment related to prior period royalties from the revised Ghana investment agreement and a $0.06 impairment of other long-lived assets and marketable securities. After adjusting for these items, we reported net income of $20 million or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was also impacted by the noncash reclamation charge, the revised Ghana investment agreement and asset impairment. In other words, the same items, except for taxes, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $466 million for the quarter. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 13. We've delivered a step change in financial flexibility and maintained our investment-grade balance sheet despite lower metal pricing through a disciplined approach to project development and capital allocation. In 2015, we generated about $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. After sustaining capital, cash from core operations totaled $1.4 billion. At the end of the year, we also had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a 16% improvement from 2014. This includes 2015 net cash from divestitures of about $200 million. 
Our strong cash flow and total liquidity position of over $6 billion supports our capital priorities of funding profitable projects, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. As you can see, during the year, we spent $655 million on development capital, repaid $454 million of debt and paid $52 million in dividends. Free cash flow was negative for the fourth quarter, primarily due to timing of development capital spend for Merian and Long Canyon. We had positive cash from core operations of $27 million in the quarter, which didn't cover our Q4 development capital of just over $200 million. It's worth pointing out again that we continue to expect positive free cash flow on an annual basis, but we may not see it every quarter due to timing of development capital expenditures for our growth projects. As I noted earlier, our cash flow from core operations more than covered development capital, debt paydown and dividends for the year.
We're very pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet during 2015, including $120 million of debt repayment in Q4. In light of our strong 2015 financial and operating performance and the current gold price environment, we will evaluate options to further reduce gross debt over the coming months. 
Slide 14 demonstrates that our discipline has transformed our balance sheet into one of the healthiest in the sector. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.3 is among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 19% since 2014 and continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x at $1,200 gold. This metric may turn higher at lower pricing, but over time, these levels allow us to maintain investment-grade metrics across cycles. We work with the rating agencies and talk to them frequently to ensure they understand our strategy and results. S&P removed the negative outlook on our BBB rating in June. They also revised our liquidity assessment from strong to exceptional. Moody's recently placed Newmont and many other metals and mining companies on review. They did this across the board primarily because of their outlook for commodities pricing and their desire to do a review against that pricing deck. In general, the agencies have been very positive about the operating and financial improvements at Newmont. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Gary."

Let's shift gears to the future starting on Slide 16. Our goal is to continue improving our performance and prospects by delivering safe and profitable production, adding higher margin ounces and advancing our best projects, generating the strong returns we need to invest in growth, reduce debt and fund dividends and maintaining leading sustainability and governance practices.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Our outlook has not changed with the exception of the improvement in forecast capital spend at Merian, which I mentioned earlier. We expect to sustain the savings we've achieved to date through efficient operations, optimized projects and value-accretive transactions and to maintain gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce through 2020. Over the next 2 years, costs are expected to benefit from higher margin ounces at Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami and Long Canyon, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity cost and capital improvements. Potential upside includes further potential -- full potential savings and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been approved.
Turning to production on Slide 18. We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016. Production is then forecast to rise in 2017 as new projects come online. After that, we expect profitable production of at least 4.5 million to 5 million ounces through 2020. In the near term, higher margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha in South America. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin's surface mines and Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, Asia-Pacific will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and a higher stripping at Boddington. 
Turning to capital on Slide 19. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures over the near term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. Sustaining capital is expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital in 2016 and '17 will support our current projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next profitable growth opportunities. 
Turning to our project pipeline on Slide 20. Projects in the execution phase are progressing on schedule and at or below budget. To recap, Long Canyon is more than 45% complete and we began mining in January. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is on track and the team is evaluating promising options for concentrate processing. Merian was 66% complete at the end of January, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. And the second decline at Tanami is nearing completion and we will begin mill expansion construction in the coming months.
Turning to projects that will be up for funding review in 2016. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. Finally, the next cutback at Batu Hijau, Phase 7, represents good returns, but require significant investment. We will not move forward with Phase 7 until we've secured an amended Contract of Work and project financing.
Turning to our reserves on Slide 21. We added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit in 2015 and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. Additions included higher grade ounces at key underground mines, including 1 million ounces at Carlin and 800,000 ounces at Tanami, more than doubling reserves at the Subika underground mine with the addition of 800,000 ounces and extending the life of KCGM by adding 1.1 million equity ounces, and at Yanacocha by converting 700,000 ounces at Quecher Main. These additions help offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces, divestment of 800,000 ounces, which included Waihi, price-related changes of 3 million ounces, largely due to moving an economically marginal layback at Achim, which is not included in the current mine plan, to resources, and net negative revisions of 700,000 ounces primarily at Ahafo and Ahafo North. The strength of our gold reserves is reflected in slightly higher average year-end gold grades of 1.06 grams per tonne and reduced sensitivity to lower gold prices. We lowered our reserve price to $1,200 per ounce at the end of 2015. Operational and portfolio improvements, combined with favorable exchange rates, have reduced the downside sensitivity of a further $100 decrease in gold price to less than half of what it was last year.
Turning to Slide 22. In the near term, we expect a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth to constrain prices. In the medium term, supply is expected to decrease due to aging ore bodies, slower project development and fewer new discoveries. These factors, combined with rising demand from emerging market consumers, support a positive outlook for gold prices in the years to come. In the meantime, we're preparing for all scenarios.
Turning to Slide 23. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we'd expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost in capital, fund projects and exploration prospects that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy.
Summing it all up on Slide 24. We're proud of what we've accomplished in 2015, but our sights are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to one of the safest among all industries, taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline and maintaining leading social, environmental and governance practices and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.

So that's why you've heard us as we've announced certain projects talk about return on capital. That's a big focus. And clearly, we understand our internal projects the best, generally. So that's a key focus that we look at. But we do take a look at what's available out there around the rest of the world in terms of opportunities. We weight all of our operations, our internal projects and external opportunities on the same value and risk scale, where we look at value NPV, return on capital, mine life and position on the cost curve. We look at risk from a technical and a geopolitical and social risk aspect and really make all the decisions based on that in terms of how we then allocate capital. We're targeting roughly 20% to 25% of our free cash flow today to be paid back in dividends. We're working towards a position of getting our net debt-to-EBITDA targeting, as Laurie said, a 1 ratio at a $1,200 gold price and investing in the business along the way. And as you point out, we're making quite a bit of investment. You see that in our free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we'll see that in the first half.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont. We continue to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and cost at our operations, bringing proceeds from noncore asset sales to nea",1322,"Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont. We continue to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and cost at our operations, bringing proceeds from noncore asset sales to nearly $2 billion, building 4 profitable growth projects on time and at or below budget and strengthening our balance sheet and earnings -- and earning the best credit rating in the gold sector. Finally, we added 2 highly experienced miners to the Newmont roster to lead our business in Africa and Asia-Pacific. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Our underlying business improvements for the quarter included reducing total injury rates by 37% compared to last year, lowering our all-in sustaining costs to $828 per ounce and dropping our 2016 cost outlook by another $20 per ounce, and increasing gold production by 4% to 1.2 million ounces and copper production by 3% to 38,000 tonnes on an attributable basis. Our portfolio improvements for the quarter included reaching commercial production ahead of schedule at the new Valley Leach facility at Cripple Creek & Victor, selling our stake in Regis for $184 million and advancing our growth projects. Merian is 80% complete, Long Canyon is 65% complete and our second decline [ph] at Tanami is nearly finished. 
Value creation for the quarter included delivering adjusted EBITDA of $803 million on the back of higher grades and production and lower cost and sustaining capital; generating free cash flow of $227 million, while continuing to self fund 4 growth projects; reducing net debt by 16%; and completing a $500 million bond tender, which will lower our cash interest payment by about $28 million annually. Long-term value creation requires exceptional safety and sustainability performance.
Turning at the Slide 5. Our team worked without any injuries at Twin Creeks, Ahafo and Achim in the first quarter of 2016. We've lowered our total injury rates by 58% since 2012 and we continue to work toward our ultimate goal, which is to send all of our people home safely every day. In 2015, our sustainability performance is rated best among mining companies by the Dow Jones sustainability index and best in the areas of climate strategy, labor practices, human rights, corporate citizenship and environmental management. Newmont is also ranked as the top mining company in the S&P 500 for environmental, social and governance performance and in the top 10 overall according to Bloomberg's PSG disclosures for. This score is intended to measure a company's capacity to anticipate and manage risk and help investors weigh this competency on a consistent basis. You can read more about our performance on our website, where we recently published our 2015 sustainability report beyond in the mine. 
We're also continuing to improve our operational efficiency. Turning to Slide 6. We brought our all-in sustaining costs down to $828 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. This represents a 2.5% improvement versus the prior-year quarter and a 30% improvement since 2012. About half of these savings were realized through sustainable cost and efficiency improvements at all of our operations and higher production at our lower-cost operations. 
Running our operations more efficiently starts with solid technical fundamentals. For example, better resource modeling, which has improved orebody reliability at Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha; and advanced process modeling technology, which were using to improve recoveries at Boddington, Phoenix, Yanacocha and Ahafo and to bring the Cripple Creek & Victor mill to fall design capacity. 
Finally, we're raising our technical game in underground mining and using improved techniques to manage ground control issues at Leeville, which includes some of our most prospective underground resources. Our cost also benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates and lowering capital spending. Sustaining capital was lowered primarily due to timing, but we also expect some savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We're on track to meet production guidance of 4.8 million to 5.3 million ounces of gold in 2016. Factors contributing to this performance include drier-than-expected weather in Indonesia, which allowed us to continue mining higher grade Phase 6 ore and improved productivity at KCGM and Boddington in our Asia-Pacific region. New production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which increased our North America production by 13% versus the prior-year quarter and strong performance are at the team in Ahafo and Ghana. These increases more than offset declines in South America as we reach lower grade and transitional orders at Yanacocha. Looking forward, we expect higher second half production at Cripple Creek & Victor and our Leeville underground mines, which will offset lower production due to our planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
In Indonesia, we applied for our export permit ahead of schedule to facilitate a timely renewal. Our discussions with certain parties or interested in acquiring our stake in PTNNT continue, but financing in deal terms have not yet been finalized. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
The work we do to improve the value of our operations also applies to our portfolio. Turning to Slide 8. Our overarching goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risk we're well equipped to manage. We realized $1.9 billion in the sale of noncore assets since 2013, most recently, selling our equity stake in Regis for $184 million. And we've deployed capital to self-fund our most profitable growth projects, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we have increased mine life by about 2/3, lowered cost by nearly 20% and improved our technical and social risk profile. 
The expansion at our newest portfolio addition, Cripple Creek & Victor, is progressing ahead of schedule, turning it to Slide 9. This is a photo of the new Valley Leach facility, which began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. The recovery of the plant is also on track for completion by the end of the year. Finally, we finished modifications at Cripple Creek & Victor mill, which accounts for about 25% of the operation's production. This expansion, along with new mines at Merian and Long Canyon and the expansion at Tanami, will add up to 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs as these projects come online. 
We're also adding capacity in our leadership ranks, starting with our Board of Directors. Noreen Doyle succeeded Vince Calarco as Chair of Newmont's board earlier this week. Norine has been a director since 2005 and has served as a Vice Chair and Head of our Audit Committee. Her background includes executive leadership at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and board leadership at Crédit Suisse. Last year, she was appointed Chair of the British Banking Association. Vince will continue as a Newmont Director and will work closely with Noreen to ensure a smooth transition. 
Turning to management. Tom Palmer steps in as a Chief Operating Officer on May 1. Tom brings 22 years of mining experience to this role, the last 2 of which have been at Newmont strengthening our portfolio Asia-Pacific region. Tom will pick up where Chris Robison left off, driving the next wave of safety and operational performance improvements across the portfolio. Steve Dumble takes Tom's place as head of the Asia-Pacific region.  He's a 34-year mining veteran, whose background includes leadership roles in the range of commodities for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and LCOA. And Alvin Pistorius joins Newmont as our head of our Africa region, bringing 20 years of gold mining experience to the role. Both Stephen and Alvin have track record of delivering successful projects and transformative change in the areas of safety, productivity, sustainability and leadership development. We are pleased to have them on the team. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update in our financial results."
291795,328448276,960629,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered  great quarter again with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excludi",842,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered  great quarter again with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excluding $0.38 per share of noncash tax valuation allowances and $0.20 per share for the gain we achieved on the sale of our stake in Regis, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.34 per share. The valuation allowances are related to a tax restructuring with foreign subsidiaries acquired back in 2002 as part of the Normandy acquisition. Below, you can see a similar outcome in adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, also excluding the gain on the Regis sale. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a look at our first quarter operational performance. On top line results, gold and copper pricing were down a bit from the prior-year quarter. Attributable gold and copper production volumes held relatively steady year-over-year. You will note that copper sales volumes were up 13% from last year as we were able to catch up on some of the delayed shipments from Batu Hijau in Q1 as we had expected. Gold cash was up 4% from the prior-year quarter, predominantly because Yanacocha is now producing more deep transitional ore. This is in line with our expectations, but you also see that overall Gold CAS is down significantly from Q4 2016 as expected.  Gold AISC improved versus the prior-year quarter, in part due to timing of exploration and advanced project spending. 
As Gary mentioned, we expect to see cost improvement in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville wrap up and Merian comes online. However, second quarter will be impacted by scheduled maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a summary of first quarter financials. Higher volumes allowed us to deliver higher revenue despite slightly lower gold and copper prices. We delivered strong Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, essentially in line with the prior year, reflecting continued strong operational performance across the portfolio. During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $227 million. As I've mentioned, we expected lower free cash flow in the first half of this year, but strong operational performance, commodity tailwinds and a bit of timing came together to help us deliver an outstanding start to the year. The only real difference compared to last year's first quarter was working capital movements. For example, an increase in accounts receivable was in line with the stronger sales volumes during the quarter. We also maintained our dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. 
Now turning to Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the first quarter and how we've applied them to deliver on our capital priority. Cash from core operations or operating cash less sustaining capital from our operating sites generated over $400 million this quarter. Plus we received $184 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Regis. A primary use of cash in the quarter was the $186 million of development capital spent to support our future. This was primarily spent at Merian, Long Canyon, CC&V and Tanami. We also completed the debt tender, which I will talk more about in a minute, and paid our quarterly dividend. In addition, given our comfort level with the local cash position and our overall liquidity, Yanacocha paid a dividend. Part of that was paid to our partners and part to Newmont in the U.S. 
The restricted cash and other is primarily movement out of cash and into restricted cash to cover the scheduled payment on the PPNNT revolver next quarter. Net-net at quarter end, we have about $2.5 billion cash and equivalents the repay debt, fund growth -- profitable growth and return cash to shareholders. In other words, to continue delivering on our capital priorities. 
Turning to Slide 15 to discuss the balance sheet, Newmont has lowered net debt by 37% since 2013. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.2x remains among the lowest in the industry and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet across the gold cycle. To do that, we target net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x at 1,200 gold and seek to lower our absolute level of gross debt. 
Turning to Slide 16 to talk more about our debt schedule. In the first quarter, we completed a $500 million debt tender targeting near-term maturities and highest interest rate debt. On this slide, you can see we paid down $274 million of the 5 [ph] and 8 notes due in 2019 and $226 million of the 6 and a quarter notes due in 2039. This action had an NPV of $133 million and will lower our cash interest by about $28 million per year going forward. We continue to target between $800 million and $1.3 billion of debt reduction through 2018. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost",1283,"Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Upside that is not reflected in our current outlook includes more full potential savings, which we have netted more than $1 billion in improvements to date and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been through the board approval process. We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016, rising to between 5.2 million and 5.7 million ounces in 2017 as new projects come online. 
In South America, higher margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and at Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside not represented in our guidance. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and higher stripping at Boddington. 
Strong operating performance translates to strong financial performance. Turning to Slide 19. We reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $279 per ounce for 24% between 2012 and 2015, an improvement that was more than double the competitive average. We also reduced net debt by $1.7 billion over the last 2 years for a total of reduction of 33%, which compares favorably to an average net debt reduction of 1% among our competitors. Our return on capital employed was about 80% higher than the gold sector average and our 2015 free cash flow yield was also higher than the average. 
Turning into projects on Slide 20. Merian is 80% complete, about $100 million below budget and on track to reach commercial production later this year. Long Canyon is now 65% complete and remains on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. And the Tanami Expansion is on budget and ahead of schedule with additional production expected in the second half of 2017. Finally, our Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is progressing ahead of schedule and on budget. Together, these projects will add up to 1 million ounces at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce. Our next tranche of projects is not included in our long-term outlook. These could add 250,000 ounces of annual production and use all-in sustaining cost by another $30 per ounce. Project that will be considered for full funding in 2016 include the Ahafo Mill Expansion, which would leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost; the Subika underground mine, which would deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource; and incremental expansions at Northwest Exodus and Twin Creeks underground. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is one of our core competencies and it's key to long-term value creation. Our team discovered 70% of the ounces we produced this year and has added more than 115 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Our competitive advantage rests on our proprietary technologies, which are deployed by an expert team of nearly 200 geoscientists around the world and our land position, which includes 52,000 square kilometers in prospective districts, 75% of which are in North America and Australia. In 2015, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. These additions more than offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces. We also maintained the highest reserve ounces per share in the gold sector. Our annual exploration budget is just under $200 million and we'll spend about 75% of that among higher margin ounces just in time to support our operations. The remaining 25% will be spent on new discoveries, mainly in Brownfields or under our existing mines with some optionality in Greenfields in each of our regions. 
Turning to Slide 22 for a closer look at North America. The Rita K Pete Bajo area located southeast of Leeville is an exciting exploration story with significant upside potential. We've identified new trends using this preparatory Deep Sensing Geochemistry technology, and in 2015, increased our resources by about 130% with 16% higher grades. You can see the layout of the 3-kilometer mineralized quarter in this plan view. Less than 1/3 of the mineral inventory has been converted to reserves and resources and a significant percentage has yet to be drill tested. 
Mineralization also remains open in all directions. Turning to Slide 23. These long sections show more detail. Drilling at the Fence/Full House trend has delivered 250,000 ounces of reserves and 450,000 ounces of resource at exceptional great. We plan to drive another 10,000 meters in 2016 to further define this deposit. Rita K is a new host discovery, contiguous with our Pete Bajo mine. We expect to declare first resource in 2018 and to drill another 9,500 meters in 2016. 
Now turning into our view on gold fundamentals on Slide 24. In the near term, we anticipate that a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth will continue to constrain metal prices. That said, we've seen some notable improvement in the first quarter of 2016. Gold price increased by about 16%, the strongest upward trend since 1980; and electronically traded fund holdings increased by 20%, reversing significant decline since 2011. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise and improve fundamentals. On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012, and mine supply is expected to decrease by more than 5% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect demographic trends in China and India to derive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million by 2020 and India's middle-class is also expected to double and surpass 500 million by 2025. In the meantime, we're prepared for all scenarios. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plan. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we would expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost in capital, fund projects and exploration that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy. 
Summing it all up on Slide 26. We're proud of what we accomplished over the last 3 years and we are continuing that trajectory in the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, our sights remain set on raising our performance to the next level. You can count on us to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices, building a stronger portfolio of longer life lower-cost mines and generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.

We will have a little closer view of when that may start when we do our second quarter results in July. We do stockpile material and we'll be stockpiling. We currently have like 1.2 million, 1.3 million tonnes of ore stockpiled right next to where the mill is, so we're in good shape. That's a little over a month's supply of ore that's there to be able to handle, and that's part of the design we have and we based it of how they do the design at Roosevelt as well, where they had the same concerns as they work through the rainy season and the dry season and how we operate in other places around the world. So I think with the stockpile, that puts us in a good position to be able to work through the rainy season as we go through start-up. And that's progressing really well, as I say. The construction is looking very good.

We continued to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and cost at our operations, bringing proceeds from non-core asset sales to nearly $2 billion, building 4 profitable growth projects on time and at or below budget and strengthening our balance sheet and earnings -- and earning the best credit rating in the gold sector. Finally, we added 2 highly experienced miners to the Newmont roster to lead our business in Africa and Asia Pacific. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Our underlying business improvements for the quarter included reducing total injury rates by 37% compared to last year, lowering our all-in sustaining costs to $828 per ounce and dropping our 2016 cost outlook by another $20 per ounce, and increasing gold production by 4% to 1.2 million ounces and copper production by 3% to 38,000 tonnes on an attributable basis. Our portfolio improvements for the quarter included reaching commercial production ahead of schedule at the new valley leach facility at Cripple Creek & Victor, selling our stake in Regis for $184 million and advancing our growth projects. Merian is 80% complete, Long Canyon is 65% complete and our second decline at Tanami is nearly finished. 
Value creation for the quarter included delivering adjusted EBITDA of $803 million on the back of higher grades and production and lower cost and sustaining capital; generating free cash flow of $227 million, while continuing to self fund 4 growth projects; reducing net debt by 16%; and completing a $500 million bond tender, which will lower our cash interest payment by about $28 million annually. Long-term value creation requires exceptional safety and sustainability performance.
Turning it to Slide 5. Our team worked without any injuries at Twin Creeks, Ahafo and Akyem in the first quarter of 2016. We've lowered our total injury rates by 58% since 2012 and we continue to work toward our ultimate goal, which is to send all of our people home safely every day. 
In 2015, our sustainability performance is rated best among mining companies by the Dow Jones sustainability index and best in the areas of climate strategy, labor practices, human rights, corporate citizenship and environmental management. Newmont is also ranked as the top mining company in the S&P 500 for environmental, social and governance performance and in the top 10 overall according to Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score. The score is intended to measure a company's capacity to anticipate and manage risk and help investors weigh this competency on a consistent basis. You can read more about our performance on our website, where we recently published our 2015 sustainability report beyond the mine. 
We're also continuing to improve our operational efficiency. Turning to Slide 6. We brought our all-in sustaining costs down to $828 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. This represents a 2.5% improvement versus the prior-year quarter and a 30% improvement since 2012. About half of these savings were realized through sustainable cost and efficiency improvements at all of our operations and higher production at our lower-cost operations. 
Running our operations more efficiently starts with solid technical fundamentals. For example, better resource modeling, which has improved orebody reliability at Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha; and advanced process modeling technology, which we're using to improve recoveries at Boddington, Phoenix, Yanacocha and Ahafo and to bring the Cripple Creek & Victor mill to fall design capacity. 
Finally, we're raising our technical game in underground mining and using improved techniques to manage ground control issues at Leeville, which includes some of our most prospective underground resources. Our cost also benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates and lowering capital spending. Sustaining capital was lowered primarily due to timing, but we also expect some savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We're on track to meet production guidance of 4.8 million to 5.3 million ounces of gold in 2016. Factors contributing to this performance include drier-than-expected weather in Indonesia, which allowed us to continue mining higher grade Phase 6 ore and improved productivity at KCGM and Boddington in our Asia-Pacific region. 
New production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which increased our North America production by 13% versus the prior-year quarter and strong performance of the team in Ahafo and Ghana. These increases more than offset declines in South America as we reach lower grade and transitional orders at Yanacocha. Looking forward, we expect higher second half production at Cripple Creek & Victor and our Leeville underground mines, which will offset lower production due to our planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
In Indonesia, we applied for our export permit ahead of schedule to facilitate a timely renewal. Our discussions with certain parties who are interested in acquiring our stake in PTNNT continue, but financing in deal terms have not yet been finalized. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
The work we do to improve the value of our operations also applies to our portfolio. Turning to Slide 8. Our overarching goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risk we're well equipped to manage. We realized $1.9 billion in the sale of non-core assets since 2013, most recently, selling our equity stake in Regis for $184 million. And we've deployed capital to self-fund our most profitable growth projects, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we have increased mine life by about 2/3, lowered cost by nearly 20% and improved our technical and social risk profile. 
The expansion at our newest portfolio addition, Cripple Creek & Victor, is progressing ahead of schedule, turning you to Slide 9. This is a photo of the new valley leach facility, which began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. The recovery plant is also on track for completion by the end of the year. Finally, we finished modifications at the Cripple Creek & Victor mill, which accounts for about 25% of the operation's production. This expansion, along with new mines at Merian and Long Canyon and the expansion at Tanami, will add up to 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs as these projects come online. 
We're also adding capacity in our leadership ranks, starting with our Board of Directors. Noreen Doyle succeeded Vince Calarco as Chair of Newmont's board earlier this week. Norine has been a director since 2005 and has served as a Vice Chair and Head of our Audit Committee. Her background includes executive leadership at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and board leadership at Credit Suisse. Last year, she was appointed Chair of the British Banking Association. Vince will continue as a Newmont director and will work closely with Noreen to ensure a smooth transition. 
Turning to management. Tom Palmer steps in as a Chief Operating Officer on May 1. Tom brings 22 years of mining experience to this role, the last 2 of which have been at Newmont strengthening our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. Tom will pick up where Chris Robison left off, driving the next wave of safety and operational performance improvements across the portfolio. 
Steve Dumble takes Tom's place as Head of the Asia-Pacific region.  He's a 34-year mining veteran, whose background includes leadership roles in a range of commodities for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Alcoa. And Alwyn Pretorius joins Newmont as our Head of our Africa region, bringing 20 years of gold mining experience to the role. Both Stephen and Alwyn have track records of delivering successful projects and transformative change in the areas of safety, productivity, sustainability and leadership development. We are pleased to have them on the team. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results."
291795,328448276,960919,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again, with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Exclu",841,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again, with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excluding $0.38 per share of noncash tax valuation allowances and $0.20 per share for the gain we achieved on the sale of our stake in Regis, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.34 per share. The valuation allowances are related to a tax restructuring with a foreign subsidiary acquired back in 2002 as part of the Normandy acquisition. Below, you can see a similar outcome in adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, also excluding the gain on the Regis sale. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a look at our first quarter operational performance. On top line results, gold and copper pricing were down a bit from the prior-year quarter. Attributable gold and copper production volumes held relatively steady year-over-year. You will note that copper sales volumes were up 13% from last year as we were able to catch up on some of the delayed shipments from Batu Hijau in Q1 as we had expected. 
Gold cash was up 4% from the prior-year quarter, predominantly because Yanacocha is now producing more deep transitional ore. This is in line with our expectation, but you also see that overall Gold CAS is down significantly from Q4 2015 as expected.  Gold AISC improved versus the prior-year quarter, in part due to timing of exploration and advanced project spending. 
As Gary mentioned, we expect to see cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville wrap up and Merian comes online. However, second quarter will be impacted by scheduled maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a summary of first quarter financials. Higher volumes allowed us to deliver higher revenue despite slightly lower gold and copper prices. We delivered strong Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, essentially in line with the prior year, reflecting continued strong operational performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $227 million. As I've mentioned, we expected lower free cash flow in the first half of this year, but strong operational performance, commodity tailwinds and a bit of timing came together to help us deliver an outstanding start to the year. The only real difference compared to last year's first quarter was working capital movements. For example, an increase in accounts receivable was in line with the stronger sales volumes during the quarter. We also maintained our dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. 
Now turning to Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the first quarter and how we've applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Cash from core operations or operating cash less sustaining capital from our operating sites, generated over $400 million this quarter. Plus we received $184 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Regis. 
A primary use of cash in the quarter was the $186 million of development capital spent to support our future. This was primarily spent at Merian, Long Canyon, CC&V and Tanami. We also completed the debt tender, which I will talk more about in a minute, and paid our quarterly dividend. In addition, given our comfort level with the local cash position and our overall liquidity, Yanacocha paid a dividend. Part of that was paid to our partners and part to Newmont in the U.S. 
The restricted cash and other is primarily movement out of cash and into restricted cash to cover the scheduled payment on the PTNNT revolver next quarter. Net-net at quarter end, we have about $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents to repay debt, fund growth -- profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders. In other words, to continue delivering on our capital priorities. 
Turning to Slide 15 to discuss the balance sheet. Newmont has lowered net debt by 37% since 2013. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.2x remains among the lowest in the industry and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet across the gold cycle. To do that, we target net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x at $1,200 gold and seek to lower our absolute level of gross debt. 
Turning to Slide 16 to talk more about our debt schedule. In the first quarter, we completed a $500 million debt tender, targeting near-term maturities and highest interest rate debt. On this slide, you can see we paid down $274 million of the 5 1/8 notes due in 2019 and $226 million of the 6 1/4 notes due in 2039. This action had an NPV of $133 million and will lower our cash interest by about $28 million per year going forward. We continue to target between $800 million and $1.3 billion of debt reduction through 2018.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,328448276,960919,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost",1282,"Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Upside that is not reflected in our current outlook includes more full potential savings, which we have netted more than $1 billion in improvements to date and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been through the board approval process. 
We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016, rising to between 5.2 million and 5.7 million ounces in 2017, as new projects come online. 
In South America, higher margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and at Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside not represented in our guidance. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and higher stripping at Boddington. 
Strong operating performance translates to strong financial performance. Turning to Slide 19. We reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $279 per ounce or 24% between 2012 and 2015, an improvement that was more than double the competitive average. We also reduced net debt by $1.7 billion over the last 2 years for a total reduction of 33%, which compares favorably to an average net debt reduction of 1% among our competitors. Our return on capital employed was about 80% higher than the gold sector average, and our 2015 free cash flow yield was also higher than the average.
Turning you to projects on Slide 20. Merian is 80% complete, about $100 million below budget and on track to reach commercial production later this year. Long Canyon is now 65% complete and remains on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. And the Tanami Expansion is on budget and ahead of schedule, with additional production expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, our Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is progressing ahead of schedule and on budget. Together, these projects will add up to 1 million ounces at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce. Our next tranche of projects is not included in our long-term outlook. These could add 250,000 ounces of annual production and use all-in sustaining cost by another $30 per ounce. 
Projects that will be considered for full funding in 2016 include the Ahafo Mill Expansion, which would leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost; the Subika underground mine, which would deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo mill; and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource; and incremental expansions at Northwest Exodus and Twin Creeks underground. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is one of our core competencies and it's key to long-term value creation. Our team discovered 70% of the ounces we'll produced this year and has added more than 115 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Our competitive advantage rests on our proprietary technologies, which are deployed by an expert team of nearly 200 geoscientists around the world and our land position, which includes 52,000 square kilometers in prospective districts, 75% of which are in North America and Australia. 
In 2015, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. These additions more than offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces. We also maintained the highest reserve ounces per share in the gold sector. Our annual exploration budget is just under $200 million and we'll spend about 75% of that amount adding higher margin ounces just in time to support our operations. The remaining 25% will be spent on new discoveries, mainly in Brownfields or under our existing mines with some optionality in Greenfields in each of our regions. 
Turning to Slide 22 for a closer look at North America. The Rita K-Pete Bajo area located southeast of Leeville is an exciting exploration story, with significant upside potential. We've identified new trends using this preparatory Deep Sensing Geochemistry technology, and in 2015, increased our resources by about 130% with 16% higher grades. You can see the layout of the 3-kilometer mineralized corridor in this plan view. Less than 1/3 of the mineral inventory has been converted to reserves and resources and a significant percentage has yet to be drill tested. 
Mineralization also remains open in all directions, turning to Slide 23. These long sections show more detail. Drilling at the Fence/Full House trend has delivered 250,000 ounces of reserves and 450,000 ounces of resource at exceptional grades.e plan to drill another 10,000 meters in 2016 to further define this deposit. Rita K is a new host discovery, contiguous with our Pete Bajo mine. We expect to declare first resource in 2018 and to drill another 9,500 meters in 2016.
Now turning into our view on gold fundamentals on Slide 24. In the near term, we anticipate that a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth will continue to constrain metal prices. That said, we've seen some notable improvements in the first quarter at 2016. Gold price increased by about 16%, the strongest upward trend since 1980 and electronically traded fund holdings increased by 20%, reversing significant decline since 2011. 
In the medium term, we expect prices to rise and improve fundamentals. On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012, and mine supply is expected to decrease by more than 5% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect demographic trends in China and India to derive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million by 2020 and India's middle-class is also expected to double and surpass 500 million by 2025. In the meantime, we're prepared for all scenarios. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we would expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost and capital, fund projects and exploration that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy. 
Summing it all up on Slide 26. We're proud of what we've accomplished over the last 3 years and we are continuing that trajectory in the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, our sights remain set on raising our performance to the next level. You can count on us to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices, building a stronger portfolio of longer life lower-cost mines and generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.

We will have a little closer view of when that may start when we do our second quarter results in July. We do stockpile material and we'll be stockpiling. We currently have, like 1.2 million, 1.3 million tonnes of ore stockpiled right next to where the mill is, so we're in good shape. That's a little over a month's supply of ore that's there to be able to handle, and that's part of the design we have and we based it off how they did the design at Rosebel as well, where they had the same concerns as they work through the rainy season and the dry season and how we operate in other places around the world. So I think with the stockpile, that puts us in a good position to be able to work through the rainy season as we go through start-up. And that's progressing really well, as they say. The construction is looking very good.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont. We continued to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and costs at our operations, bringing proceeds from non-core asset sales to nearly $2 billion, building 4 profitable growth projects on time and at or below budget and strengthening our balance sheet and earnings -- and earning the best credit rating in the gold sector. Finally, we added 2 highly experienced miners to the Newmont roster to lead our business in Africa and Asia Pacific. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Our underlying business improvements for the quarter included reducing total injury rates by 37% compared to last year, lowering our all-in sustaining cost to $828 per ounce and dropping our 2016 cost outlook by another $20 per ounce, and increasing gold production by 4% to 1.2 million ounces and copper production by 3% to 38,000 tonnes on an attributable basis. 
Our portfolio improvements for the quarter included reaching commercial production ahead of schedule at the new valley leach facility at Cripple Creek & Victor, selling our stake in Regis for $184 million and advancing our growth projects. Merian is 80% complete, Long Canyon is 65% complete and our second decline at Tanami is nearly finished. 
Value creation for the quarter included delivering adjusted EBITDA of $803 million on the back of higher grades and production and lower costs and sustaining capital; generating free cash flow of $227 million, while continuing to self-fund 4 growth projects; reducing net debt by 16%; and completing a $500 million bond tender, which will lower our cash interest payment by about $28 million annually. Long-term value creation requires exceptional safety and sustainability performance.
Turning it to Slide 5. Our team worked without any injuries at Twin Creeks, Ahafo and Akyem in the first quarter of 2016. We've lowered our total injury rates by 58% since 2012 and we continue to work toward our ultimate goal, which is to send all of our people home safely every day. 
In 2015 our sustainability performance was rated best among mining companies by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and best in the areas of climate strategy, labor practices, human rights, corporate citizenship and environmental management. Newmont is also ranked as the top mining company in the S&P 500 for environmental, social and governance performance and in the top 10 overall according to Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score. The score is intended to measure a company's capacity to anticipate and manage risk and help investors weigh this competency on a consistent basis. You can read more about our performance on our website, where we recently published our 2015 sustainability report Beyond the Mine. 
We're also continuing to improve our operational efficiency, turning to Slide 6. We brought our all-in sustaining costs down to $828 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. This represents a 2.5% improvement versus the prior-year quarter and a 30% improvement since 2012. About half of these savings were realized through sustainable cost and efficiency improvements at all of our operations and higher production at our lower-cost operations. 
Running our operations more efficiently starts with solid technical fundamentals. For example, better resource modeling, which has improved orebody reliability at Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha; and advanced process modeling technology, which we're using to improve recoveries at Boddington, Phoenix, Yanacocha and Ahafo and to bring the Cripple Creek & Victor mill to full design capacity. 
Finally, we're raising our technical game in underground mining and using improved techniques to manage ground control issues at Leeville, which includes some of our most prospective underground resources. Our cost also benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates and lowering capital spending. Sustaining capital was lower primarily due to timing, but we also expect some savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We're on track to meet production guidance of 4.8 million to 5.3 million ounces of gold in 2016. Factors contributing to this performance include drier-than-expected weather in Indonesia, which allowed us to continue mining higher grade Phase 6 ore and improve productivity at KCGM and Boddington in our Asia-Pacific region. 
New production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which increased our North America production by 13% versus the prior-year quarter and strong performance at Akyem and Ahafo in Ghana. These increases more than offset declines in South America as we reach lower grade and transitional ores at Yanacocha. Looking forward, we expect higher second half production at Cripple Creek & Victor and our Leeville underground mines, which will offset lower production due to a planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. 
In Indonesia, we applied for our export permit ahead of schedule to facilitate a timely renewal. Our discussions with certain parties who are interested in acquiring our stake in PTNNT continue, but financing and deal terms have not yet been finalized. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. 
The work we do to improve the value of our operations also applies to our portfolio. Turning to Slide 8. Our overarching goal is to build a portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risk we're well equipped to manage. We realized $1.9 billion from the sale of non-core assets since 2013, most recently selling our equity stake in Regis for $184 million. And we've deployed capital to self-fund our most profitable growth projects, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we have increased mine life by about 2/3, lowered costs by nearly 20% and improved our technical and social risk profile. 
The expansion at our newest portfolio addition, Cripple Creek & Victor, is progressing ahead of schedule, turning you to Slide 9. This is a photo of the new valley leach facility, which began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. The recovery plant is also on track for completion by the end of the year. Finally, we finished modifications at the Cripple Creek & Victor mill, which accounts for about 25% of the operation's production. This expansion, along with new mines at Merian and Long Canyon and the expansion at Tanami, will add up to 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs as these projects come online. 
We're also adding capacity in our leadership ranks, starting with our Board of Directors. Noreen Doyle succeeded Vince Calarco as Chair of Newmont's board earlier this week. Noreen has been a director since 2005 and has served as vice chair and head of our Audit Committee. Her background includes executive leadership at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and board leadership at Credit Suisse. Last year she was appointed Chair of the British Banking Association. Vince will continue as a Newmont director and will work closely with Noreen to ensure a smooth transition. 
Turning to management. Tom Palmer steps in as Chief Operating Officer on May 1. Tom brings 22 years of mining experience to this role, the last 2 of which have been at Newmont, strengthening our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. Tom will pick up where Chris Robison left off, driving the next wave of safety and operational performance improvement across the portfolio. 
Steve Dumble takes Tom's place as head of the Asia-Pacific region.  He's a 34-year mining veteran whose background includes leadership roles in a range of commodities for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Alcoa. And Alwyn Pretorius joins Newmont as our head of our Africa region, bringing 20 years of gold mining experience to the role. Both Stephen and Alwyn have track records of delivering successful projects and transformative change in the areas of safety, productivity, sustainability and leadership development. We are pleased to have them on the team. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results."
291795,328448276,961089,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again, with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11.

I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again, with solid financial results. Turning to Slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excluding $0.38 per share of noncash tax valuation allowances and $0.20 per share for the gain we achieved on the sale of our stake in Regis, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.34 per share. The valuation allowances are related to a tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary acquired back in 2002 as part of the Normandy acquisition. Below you can see a similar outcome in adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, also excluding the gain on the Regis sale. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a look at our first quarter operational performance. On top line results, gold and copper pricing were down a bit from the prior-year quarter. Attributable gold and copper production volumes held relatively steady year-over-year. You will note that copper sales volumes were up 13% from last year as we were able to catch up on some of the delayed shipments from Batu Hijau in Q1 as we had expected. 
Gold CAS was up 4% from the prior-year quarter, predominantly because Yanacocha is now producing more deep transitional ore. This is in line with our expectation. But you also see that overall gold CAS is down significantly from Q4 2015 as expected.  Gold AISC improved versus the prior-year quarter, in part due to timing of exploration and advanced project spending. 
As Gary mentioned, we expect to see cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville wrap up and Merian comes online. However, second quarter will be impacted by scheduled maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a summary of first quarter financials. Higher volumes allowed us to deliver higher revenue despite slightly lower gold and copper prices. We delivered strong Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, essentially in line with the prior year, reflecting continued strong operational performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter we also generated positive free cash flow of $227 million. As I've mentioned, we expected lower free cash flow in the first half of this year, but strong operational performance, commodity tailwinds and a bit of timing came together to help us deliver an outstanding start to the year. The only real difference compared to last year's first quarter was working capital movements. For example, an increase in accounts receivable was in line with the stronger sales volumes during the quarter. We also maintained our dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. 
Now turning to Slide 14. On this slide you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the first quarter and how we've applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Cash from core operations or operating cash less sustaining capital from our operating sites generated over $400 million this quarter. Plus we received $184 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Regis. 
A primary use of cash in the quarter was the $186 million of development capital spent to support our future. This was primarily spent at Merian, Long Canyon, CC&V and Tanami. We also completed the debt tender, which I will talk more about in a minute, and paid our quarterly dividend. In addition, given our comfort level with the local cash position and our overall liquidity, Yanacocha paid a dividend. Part of that was paid to our partners and part to Newmont in the U.S. 
The restricted cash and other is primarily movement out of cash and into restricted cash to cover the scheduled payment on the PTNNT revolver next quarter. Net-net, at quarter end we have about $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents to repay debt, fund growth -- profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders. In other words, to continue delivering on our capital priorities. 
Turning to Slide 15 to discuss the balance sheet. Newmont has lowered net debt by 37% since 2013. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.2x remains among the lowest in the industry and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet across the gold cycle. To do that, we target net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x at $1,200 gold and seek to lower our absolute level of gross debt. 
Turning to Slide 16 to talk more about our debt schedule. In the first quarter we completed a $500 million debt tender, targeting near-term maturities and highest interest rate debt. On this slide you can see we paid down $274 million of the 5 1/8 notes due in 2019 and $226 million of the 6 1/4 notes due in 2039. This action had an NPV of $133 million and will lower our cash interest by about $28 million per year going forward. We continue to target between $800 million and $1.3 billion of debt reduction through 2018.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,328448276,961089,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years we expect our costs to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions; higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines; and ongoing productivity, cos",1285,"Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on Slide 18. Over the next few years we expect our costs to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions; higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines; and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Upside that is not reflected in our current outlook includes more full potential savings, which we have netted more than $1 billion in improvements to date, and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been through the board approval process. 
We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million and 5.3 million ounces in 2016, rising to between 5.2 million and 5.7 million ounces in 2017, as new projects come online. 
In South America, higher margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha. Similarly, in North America lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and at Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside not represented in our guidance. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika underground resource. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and higher stripping at Boddington. 
Strong operating performance translates to strong financial performance. Turning to Slide 19. We reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $279 per ounce or 24% between 2012 and 2015, an improvement that was more than double the competitive average. We also reduced net debt by $1.7 billion over the last 2 years for a total reduction of 33%, which compares favorably to an average net debt reduction of 1% among our competitors. Our return on capital employed was about 80% higher than the gold sector average, and our 2015 free cash flow yield was also higher than the average.
Turning you to projects on Slide 20. Merian is 80% complete, about $100 million below budget and on track to reach commercial production later this year. Long Canyon is now 65% complete and remains on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. And the Tanami expansion is on budget and ahead of schedule, with additional production expected in the second half of 2017. 
Finally, our Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is progressing ahead of schedule and on budget. Together these projects will add up to 1 million ounces at average all-in sustaining costs of around $700 per ounce. Our next tranche of projects is not included in our long-term outlook. These could add 250,000 ounces of annual production and reduce all-in sustaining costs by another $30 per ounce. 
Projects that will be considered for full funding in 2016 include the Ahafo mill expansion, which would leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs; the Subika underground mine, which would deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource; and incremental expansions at Northwest Exodus and Twin Creeks underground. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is one of our core competencies and it's key to long-term value creation. Our team discovered 70% of the ounces we'll produce this year and has added more than 115 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Our competitive advantage rests on our proprietary technologies which are deployed by an expert team of nearly 200 geoscientists around the world and our land position, which includes 52,000 square kilometers in prospective districts, 75% of which are in North America and Australia. 
In 2015 we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. These additions more than offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces. We also maintained the highest reserve ounces per share in the gold sector. Our annual exploration budget is just under $200 million and we'll spend about 75% of that amount adding higher margin ounces just in time to support our operations. The remaining 25% will be spent on new discoveries, mainly in brownfields or on our existing mines, with some optionality in greenfields in each of our regions. 
Turning to Slide 22 for a closer look at North America. The Rita K-Pete Bajo area located southeast of Leeville is an exciting exploration story with significant upside potential. We've identified new trends using this preparatory Deep Sensing Geochemistry technology and in 2015 increased our resources by about 130% with 16% higher grades. You can see the layout of the 3-kilometer mineralized corridor in this plan view. Less than 1/3 of the mineral inventory has been converted to reserves and resources and a significant percentage has yet to be drill tested. 
Mineralization also remains open in all directions, turning to Slide 23. These long sections show more detail. Drilling at the Fence/Full House trend has delivered 250,000 ounces of reserves and 450,000 ounces of resource at exceptional grades. We plan to drill another 10,000 meters in 2016 to further define this deposit. Rita K is a new host discovery, contiguous with our Pete Bajo mine. We expect to declare first resource in 2018 and to drill another 9,500 meters in 2016.
Now turning you to our view on gold fundamentals on Slide 24. In the near term we anticipate that a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth will continue to constrain metal prices. That said, we've seen some notable improvements in the first quarter of 2016. Gold price increased by about 16%, the strongest upward trend since 1980. And electronically traded fund holdings increased by 20%, reversing significant decline since 2011. 
In the medium term we expect prices to rise and improve fundamentals. On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by more than 5% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect demographic trends in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million by 2020 and India's middle class is also expected to double and surpass 500 million by 2025. In the meantime, we're prepared for all scenarios. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we would expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost and capital, fund projects and exploration that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy. 
Summing it all up on Slide 26. We're proud of what we've accomplished over the last 3 years and we are continuing that trajectory in the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, our sights remain set on raising our performance to the next level. You can count on us to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations; maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices; building a stronger portfolio of longer life, lower-cost mines; and generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions."

And we're looking still here in the second half of this year to enter into commercial production. We will have a little closer view of when that may start when we do our second quarter results in July. We do stockpile material and will be stockpiling. We currently have like 1.2 million, 1.3 million tonnes of ore stockpiled right next to where the mill is, so we're in good shape. That's a little over a month's supply of ore that's there to be able to handle. And that's part of the design we have. And we based it off how they did the design at Rosebel as well, where they had the same concerns as they work through the rainy season and the dry season and how we operate in other places around the world. So I think with the stockpile that puts us in a good position to be able to work through the rainy season as we go through start-up. And that's progressing really well, as I say. The construction is looking very good. Chris was just down there about a month ago reviewing progress.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding 5 high-margin projects and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash shareholders. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining cost by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the quarter include announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek and Victor and Tanami on-time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price link dividend. Strong performance started our operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. We've lowered our total injury rates by 8 [ph] 54 percent since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix who recently reached a milestone of 3 years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor, who just reached 4 months working without injuries, the operation's best safety performance to date. 
Safety and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries per 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. The same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new Valley Leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule. 
Turning to Slide 6 for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining cost down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced cost by 28% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of higher production at lower-cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our cost also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. Second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%; improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami; and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores. In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming online at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full year 2016 gold guidance, given stronger production from the rest of the portfolio. 
I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on Slide 8. Last month, we announce an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development along. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent. The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about [ph] 3 quarters of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self fund our best projects. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 9. Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter, and we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support and improve internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range. On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the correct fit and elsewhere in the concession. Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about 2 months ahead of schedule. The project remains on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017. Tier 2 exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high-teens. 
Moving from new mines to expansions. The CC&V expansion includes a new mill at Leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Planned modifications are complete and throughput continues to improve. The Valley Leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule, and recovery plant will be complete by year-end. The Tanami Expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April, 3 months ahead of schedule, and mill demolition is complete and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid-30% range. Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing the adjacent discoveries. These 4 projects, Merian, Long Canyon and the 2 expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for our financial results"
291795,366914638,1009298,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12.

I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second-quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior-year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is at $0.34 per share, noncash tax valuation allowance. 
I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we had the opportunity to carryback losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we will use them soon. The transaction overall resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance. Strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru. Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior-year quarter and gold all-in sustaining cost has improved $33 per ounce, both benefiting from the higher volume and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar. As Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and especially Merian coming online. 
Turning to Slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production, along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the 83 I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable. We maintained our gold price link dividend of 2.5 cents per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold prices maintained, our gold price link dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 15. On the slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver in our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest cost and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest. 
Turning to Slide 16. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds, less the cash held at PTNNT for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality and, as you can see, ending up with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation. 
Turning to Slide 17. Strong organic performance assisted by fair value asset sale has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1x net debt-to-EBITDA at $1,200 gold. As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date, and we continue to expect that repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt in our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our 3-year cumulative free cash flow leaves the industry, allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invested cash in our highest return projects, resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed. 
In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong, giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflect improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve cost by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future. 
Turning to production guidance on Slide 21. We expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction. In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer-term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting the Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017 when Phase 6 ore production line is down. 
Turning to capital on Slide 22. Our outlook calls were stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects. 
Turning to our pipeline on Slide 23. I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Catcher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these 2 projects in 2017. 
The studio Integral is moving to pre-feasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. 
Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results. Turning to more details. Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900 feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin north area. Sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine, while leveraging existing infrastructure. The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by 7 years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining cost by an average of $25 per ounce during the first 5 years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly prospective district. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 25. The Ahafo Mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production and stockpile. Developing the Subika underground mine will deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions in both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to South America on Slide 26. We've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of a studio intergrowth, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to date, we are pursuing development of Catcher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019. Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with prefeasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold copper sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Prefeasibility studies are expected to take 2 years and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders, whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or, at most, 1 rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends. 
Turning to Slide 28. As I mentioned, the press interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 [ph] million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same, and I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycle. 
On Slide 29, we built a solid foundation over the last 3 years and we continue to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016. But we're not relying on pricing gold price or resting on our laurels. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue delivering safer and more efficient operations, a portfolio of longer life lower-cost assets, an exceptional project pipeline and exploration record and a stronger balance sheet.

It's a good thing we've got good folks in the team who know how to help with those things. First of all, on your oil price question, we've taken our long-term oil price assumption from $65 a barrel to $50 a barrel in those assumptions. So we'll continue to keep an eye on that, but that's the change you see reflected in part, along with the Northwest Exodus and the changes to our longer term price or cost outlook that we provided in guidance. In terms of focus, clearly, we're focused now on making sure we get a successful transition. As I've said, our Batu Hijau is a great mine with great employees. Want to make sure we get a good hand over of that operation to the buyer. So a lot of focus on that here over the next 3 months. And we've got 4, now 5 with Northwest Exodus projects that are going through, in some cases, their final stage, Merian bringing that online successfully is a big focus; long Canyon early next year; Tanami getting that through and the rest at CC&V; and then of course, the Northwest Exodus. So I want to make sure the team is focused on continuing to bring those projects online, on budget or below and on schedule or sooner than schedule. So that's really the big focus. I think, exploration-wise, we continue to see that as a core competency with the team and our ability to add to existing operations and the work we're doing in the greenfield areas that we've shown on some prior slides in the past in terms of exploration in different areas around the world continues to be a focus for us."

I think, what we've targeted when we put the current gold price linked dividend payout schedule together, and that was about 1.5 years, almost 2 years ago now, was based on the way we saw our production and cash flow out over the next several years tied in with our need to continue to pay down debt and invest in projects, and that was based on the 20% to 25% of our free cash flow data back out the dividend. As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations, that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount, and we're going to look at that. We reviewed our plans for the next 5 years at the board meeting in October, our 2017 plant, as we call it. And as part of that, we'll review whether we want to change that payout percentage, once again looking with what the cash needs will be for debt reduction, for investment in projects and also for return to shareholders.

And I think, the fact that we do have a gold price linked dividend, we do take into account higher cash flows as they come from the higher gold price and look to share that back with shareholders. In terms of M&A, we were successful last year with our acquisition of CC&V in a lower gold price environment at a time when Anglo Gold needed the cash, and it was an opportunity that we were able to capitalize on and we see that in the results in terms of how that fits in. Where it makes sense, where it fits and improves the quality of our portfolio is something we'd always consider, but it's got to be done at a value that makes sense to us and to our shareholders."

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding 5 high-margin projects and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining cost by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the quarter include announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami on time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. 
Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price-linked dividend. Strong performance starts at our operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. We've lowered our total injury rates by 54% since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix who recently reached a milestone of 3 years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor who just reached 4 months working without injuries, the operation's best safety performance to date. 
Safety and efficiency go hand in hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries for 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. The same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new valley leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule. 
Turning to Slide 6 for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining cost down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced cost by 28% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of higher production at lower cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our cost also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. Second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%; improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami; and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores. In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming online at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full year 2016 gold guidance, giving stronger production from the rest of the portfolio. 
I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on Slide 8. Last month, we announce an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development at Elang. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent. The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, it strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about 3/4 of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self-fund our best projects. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 9. Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter, and we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support and improve internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range. On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the current pit and elsewhere in the concession. Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about 2 months ahead of schedule. The project remains on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017. Tier 2 exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high teens. 
Moving from new mines to expansions. The CC&V expansion includes a new mill and leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Planned modifications are complete and throughput continues to improve. The valley leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule, and the recovery plant will be complete by the year-end. The Tanami Expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April, 3 months ahead of schedule, and mill demolition is complete, and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid-30% range. Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. These 4 projects, Merian, Long Canyon and the 2 expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for financial results."
291795,366914638,1009681,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 pe",1063,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is at $0.34 per share, noncash tax valuation allowance. 
I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we had the opportunity to carryback losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we would use them soon. The transaction overall resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance. Strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru. Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior year quarter and gold all-in sustaining cost has improved $33 per ounce, both benefiting from the higher volumes and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar. As  Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and especially Merian coming online. 
Turning to Slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production, along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the $83 million I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable. We maintained our gold price-linked dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold price is maintained, our gold price-linked dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 15. On the slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price-linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest. 
Turning to Slide 16. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds, less the cash held at PTNNT for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality and as you can see, ending up here with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation. 
Turning to Slide 17. Strong organic performance assisted by fair value asset sale has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1x net debt-to-EBITDA at $1,200 gold. As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date, and we continue to expect that repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt on our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our 3-year cumulative free cash flow leaves the industry, allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invested cash in our highest return projects, resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed. 
In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong, giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve cost by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future. 
Turning to production guidance on Slide 21. We expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction. In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer-term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting that Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017 when Phase 6 ore production line is down. 
Turning to capital on Slide 22. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects. 
Turning to our pipeline on Slide 23. I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Quecher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these 2 projects in 2017. 
Estudio Integral is moving to pre-feasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. 
Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results. Turning to more details. Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900 feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin north area. Sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine, while leveraging existing infrastructure. The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by 7 years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining cost by an average of $25 per ounce during the first 5 years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly prospective district. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 25. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build the capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production and stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine will deliver higher-grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to South America on Slide 26. We've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of Estudio Integral, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to date, we are pursuing development of Quecher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019. Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with prefeasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold copper sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Pre-feasibility studies are expected to take 2 years and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders, whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or, at most, one rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends. 
Turning to Slide 28. As I mentioned, depressed interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer-dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same, and I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycles. 
On Slide 29, we built a solid foundation over the last 3 years and we continued to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016. But we're not relying on rising gold price or resting on our laurels. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue delivering safer and more efficient operations, a portfolio of longer life lower-cost assets, an exceptional project pipeline and exploration record, and a stronger balance sheet. 
Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn it over to the operator for your questions."

I think, what we targeted when we put the current gold price-linked dividend payout schedule together, and that was about 1.5 years, almost 2 years ago now, was based on the way we saw our production and cash flow out over the next several years tied in with our need to continue to pay down debt and invest in projects, and that was based on about a 20% to 25% of our free cash flow paid back out in the dividend. As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations, that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount, and we're going to look at that. We review our plans for the next 5 years at the board meeting in October, our 2017 plan, as we call it. And as part of that, we'll review whether we want to change that payout percentage, once again, looking at what the cash needs will be for debt reduction, for investment in the projects and also for returns to shareholders.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy; which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficie",1108,"Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy; which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding 5 high-margin projects and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining cost by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the quarter include announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami on time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. 
Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price-linked dividend. Strong performance starts at our operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. We've lowered our total injury rates by 54% since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix who recently reached a milestone of 3 years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor who just reached 4 months working without injuries, the operation's best safety performance to date. 
Safety and efficiency go hand in hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries per 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. The same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new valley leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule. 
Turning to Slide 6 for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining costs down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced cost by 28% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of higher production at lower cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our costs also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. Second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%; improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami; and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores. In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming online at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full year 2016 gold guidance, given stronger production from the rest of the portfolio. 
I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on Slide 8. Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development at Elang. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent. The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, it strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about 3/4 of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self-fund our best projects. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 9. Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter, and we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support an improved internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range. On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the current pit and elsewhere in the concession. Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about 2 months ahead of schedule. The project remains on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017. Here too, exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high teens. 
Moving from new mines to expansions. The CC&V expansion includes a new mill and leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Planned modifications are complete, and throughput continues to improve. The valley leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule, and the recovery plant will be complete by the year-end. The Tanami Expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April; 3 months ahead of schedule, and mill demolition is complete, and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid-30% range. Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. These 4 projects, Merian, Long Canyon and the 2 expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for financial results."
291795,366914638,1009887,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 pe",1064,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is a $0.34 per share, noncash tax valuation allowance. 
I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we had the opportunity to carryback losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we would use them soon. The transaction overall resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance. Strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru. Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior year quarter and gold all-in sustaining cost has improved $33 per ounce, both benefiting from the higher volumes and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar. As  Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and especially Merian coming online. 
Turning to Slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production, along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the $83 million I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable. We maintained our gold price-linked dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold price is maintained, our gold price-linked dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 15. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price-linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest. 
Turning to Slide 16. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds, less the cash held at PTNNT, for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality and as you can see, ending up here with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation. 
Turning to Slide 17. Strong organic performance assisted by fair value asset sales has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1x net debt-to-EBITDA at $1,200 gold. As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date, and we continue to expect debt repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt on our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our 3-year cumulative free cash flow leads the industry; allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invest this cash in our highest return projects, resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed. 
In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong, giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,366914638,1009887,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to Slide 20. This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset t",1034,"Thanks, Laurie. Turning to Slide 20. This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve cost by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future. 
Turning to production guidance on Slide 21. We expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction. In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer-term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting that Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017 when Phase 6 ore production winds down. 
Turning to capital on Slide 22. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects. 
Turning to our pipeline on Slide 23. I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Quecher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these 2 projects in 2017. 
Estudio Integral is moving to pre-feasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. 
Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results. Turning to more details. Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900 feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin, North area. Sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine, while leveraging existing infrastructure. The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by 7 years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining cost by an average of $25 per ounce during the first 5 years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly prospective district. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 25. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine will deliver higher-grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to South America on Slide 26. We've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of Estudio Integral, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to date, we are pursuing development of Quecher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019. Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with pre-feasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold, copper, sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Pre-feasibility studies are expected to take 2 years and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders, whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the Fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or, at most, one rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends. 
Turning to Slide 28. As I mentioned, depressed interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer-dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same, and I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycles. 
On Slide 29, we've built a solid foundation over the last 3 years and we continued to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016. But we're not relying on rising gold price or resting on our laurels.

We want to make sure we give a good hand over of that operation to the buyer. So a lot of focus on that here over the next 3 months.

Merian, bringing that online successfully is a big focus; Long Canyon, early next year; Tanami, getting that through and the rest at CC&V; and then of course, Northwest Exodus. So I want to make sure the team is focused on continuing to bring those projects online, on budget or below and on schedule or sooner than schedule. So that's really the big focus.

As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations, that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount, and we're going to look at that.

And it's really the arsenic that's the challenge here in terms -- the technical challenge that we're working through. We believe we have a technical path. We've got to work through the different steps. The other part of this process would involve a copper leach process. And we've been testing the bio leaching and the SXEW process. Actually it's not only integral for recovery of copper from the leach pads, but it also would be integral with the part of the process, post-processing concentrates through the autoclave to produce the copper.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy; which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficie",1108,"Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy; which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding 5 high-margin projects and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to specifics on Slide 4. Comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining cost by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the quarter include announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami on time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. 
Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price-linked dividend. Strong performance starts at our operations. 
Turning to Slide 5. We've lowered our total injury rates by 54% since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix who recently reached a milestone of 3 years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor who just reached 4 months working without injuries, the operation's best safety performance to date. 
Safety and efficiency go hand in hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries per 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. The same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new valley leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule. 
Turning to Slide 6 for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining costs down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced cost by 28% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of higher production at lower cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our costs also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. Second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%; improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami; and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores. In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming online at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full year 2016 gold guidance, given stronger production from the rest of the portfolio. 
I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on Slide 8. Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development at Elang. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent. The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, it strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about 3/4 of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self-fund our best projects. 
Turning to our current projects on Slide 9. Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter, and we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support an improved internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range. On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the current pit and elsewhere in the concession. Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about 2 months ahead of schedule. The project remains on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017. Here too, exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high teens. 
Moving from new mines to expansions. The CC&V expansion includes a new mill and leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Planned modifications are complete, and throughput continues to improve. The valley leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule, and the recovery plant will be complete by the year-end. The Tanami Expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April; 3 months ahead of schedule, and mill demolition is complete, and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid-30% range. Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. These 4 projects, Merian, Long Canyon and the 2 expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining cost of around $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for financial results."
291795,366914638,1010249,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 pe",1064,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income, turning to Slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is a $0.34 per share, noncash tax valuation allowance. 
I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we had the opportunity to carryback losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we would use them soon. The transaction overall resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance. Strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru. Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior year quarter and gold all-in sustaining cost has improved $33 per ounce, both benefiting from the higher volumes and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar. As  Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and especially Merian coming online. 
Turning to Slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production, along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio. 
During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the $83 million I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable. We maintained our gold price-linked dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold price is maintained, our gold price-linked dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance. 
Now turning to our capital priorities on Slide 15. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price-linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest. 
Turning to Slide 16. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds, less the cash held at PTNNT, for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality and as you can see, ending up here with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation. 
Turning to Slide 17. Strong organic performance assisted by fair value asset sales has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1x net debt-to-EBITDA at $1,200 gold. As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date, and we continue to expect debt repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt on our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction. 
Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our 3-year cumulative free cash flow leads the industry; allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invest this cash in our highest return projects, resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed. 
In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong, giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,366914638,1010249,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to Slide 20. This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau.

This slide shows our all-in sustaining cost guidance, excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve cost by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future. 
Turning to production guidance on Slide 21. We expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction. In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer-term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting that Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017 when Phase 6 ore production winds down. 
Turning to capital on Slide 22. Our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects. 
Turning to our pipeline on Slide 23. I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Quecher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these 2 projects in 2017. 
Estudio Integral is moving to pre-feasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. 
Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results. Turning to more details. Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900 feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin, North area. Sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine, while leveraging existing infrastructure. The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by 7 years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining cost by an average of $25 per ounce during the first 5 years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly prospective district. 
Turning to Africa on Slide 25. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine will deliver higher-grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to South America on Slide 26. We've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of Estudio Integral, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to date, we are pursuing development of Quecher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019. Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with pre-feasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold, copper, sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Pre-feasibility studies are expected to take 2 years and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders, whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the Fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or, at most, one rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends. 
Turning to Slide 28. As I mentioned, depressed interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer-dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same, and I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycles. 
On Slide 29, we've built a solid foundation over the last 3 years and we continued to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016. But we're not relying on rising gold price or resting on our laurels. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue delivering safer and more efficient operations, a portfolio of longer life lower-cost assets, an exceptional project pipeline and exploration record, and a stronger balance sheet.

In terms of focus, clearly, we're focused now on making sure we get a successful transition. As I've said Batu Hijau was a great mine with great employees. We want to make sure we give a good hand over of that operation to the buyer. So a lot of focus on that here over the next 3 months. And we've got 4, now 5 with Northwest Exodus projects that are going through, in some cases, their final stage. Merian, bringing that online successfully is a big focus; Long Canyon, early next year; Tanami, getting that through and the rest at CC&V; and then of course, Northwest Exodus. So I want to make sure the team is focused on continuing to bring those projects online, on budget or below and on schedule or sooner than schedule. So that's really the big focus.

As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations, that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount, and we're going to look at that.

And it's really the arsenic that's the challenge here in terms -- the technical challenge that we're working through. We believe we have a technical path. We've got to work through the different steps. The other part of this process would involve a copper leach process. And we've been testing the bio leaching and the SXEW process. Actually it's not only integral for recovery of copper from the leach pads, but it also would be integral with the part of the process, post-processing concentrates through the autoclave to produce the copper.

Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to",1197,"Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.
First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues. 
Prior to that, she was CFO for MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.
The second news update, I'm please to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices and beginning in 2017 through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.
Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.
Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on Slide 3.
We continue to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining cost at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year but still in line with our 2016 guidance and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour of gold next month or about 2 months ahead of schedule. 
We also continued to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.
Turning to Slide 4. Sending people home safely every day is a matter of principle and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the mining sector's top performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for [indiscernible] It was an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.
Turning to Slide 5 for more on that transition. We poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade of profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget as well as our successful exploration program. 
Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.
Turning to Long Canyon on Slide 6. Construction is nearly complete, and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We're confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold price is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit and mineralization remains open in all directions.
Moving to the full portfolio on Slide 7. Even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 22% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs are slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook. 
Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek and Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo. 
Year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. 
We look forward to sharing our refreshed 5-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.
Turning to Slide 8. We positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund 5 projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining cost of less than $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.
I'll turn now to Slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes: receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia; our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction; and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB stake and PTNNT, a valid export license at closing. The current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,403309941,1063041,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's",981,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.
Now before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale, and as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operation. 
Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated what happened, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide.
GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million noncash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operation and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13. 
Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from [indiscernible] pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior year quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 for a look at our third quarter financial performance. Increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost triple compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million. 
Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth, and yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities. 
This morning, we announced a $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With a total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.
Turning to net debt. We continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1x at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1x is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded, given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term, with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense, so we focus on a balance of the 2 efforts.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on Slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017. 
The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 [ph] per share, triple the prior year quarter dividend. 
The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V; and repay debt, we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation and returning cash to shareholders. As I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter, and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles. 
With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results."

We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian; producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Car",697,"Thanks, Laurie. We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian; producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Carlin and Boddington more than offset declining production at Yanacocha; and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects. 
Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory drawdowns in Africa and some operational changes, including low grade deep transitional at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin surface mines.
Turning to our regional performance on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added Sinai to the leach pad last week and we Carmen to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies that pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. 
We've completed the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected, and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case. 
Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mines to the northwest. Work to install some ventilation equipment is underway, and this project will reach full production in 2018. The flip of the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North Area will impact fourth quarter production. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and have evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year so there's no impact to longer-term production or costs.
We're making good progress at underground. We have fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof valves designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. Gary and I were in Suriname 2 weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha through the potential development of mine to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have 3 drill rigs operating in that Chaquicocha decline, and testing recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plan for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. We started full potential in Australia nearly 4 years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May. 
At Tanami, the decline is in use. Engineering procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine at Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.
Finally, turning to Africa on Slide 19. The team in Ahafo continued to deliver a solid performance achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries. And Africa remains our lowest region for injuries. 
Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. With that, I'll return the call to Gary on Slide 20."
291795,403309941,1063041,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering",611,"Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering projects into production all the way out to our greenfield exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance, and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana.
Turning to Slide 21. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. We'll also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles. 
The Subika underground mine will produce ore grades that are 3x higher than the current surface mine grades and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with first production in 2018 and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.
Turning to Slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists. 
Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013. At Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010; at Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003 and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries; and finally at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 23. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment, and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals. 
On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.
Turning to Slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last 3.5 years, and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. While we're not relying on rising gold prices, we're resting on our achievements. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.

But I see that as one upside. I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, we -- it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results, whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit. The results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which -- with much higher grades than what the current ore body averages. And that shows up -- I don't think we've got it in the slide pack but in the last quarter slides, we had some cross-sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So I'm very encouraged there. And we continue to look is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore, so it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance."

I think in terms of reconciliation, we're probably reconciling with a bit higher tons [ph] than what was expected. And that's not unusual as the upper parts of the ore body and the fringes to have found that but as we get in grade as reconciling very close to what we expected. As you may recall, when we announced the project, I talked about the fact we did an additional roughly $25 million worth of drilling to understand that ore body. So I'm not surprised that it's coming in but that's coming in well. I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and the backhoe to help feed into the mill and that process is going well. I think early on here for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter -- actually, you're right at the surface, we've got roots and things from plant material. Some of that's come through, but I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing that they've had to manage with. I wouldn't say it was a surprise but just it add some complexity to the startup, but I think the startup and ramp-up has been going very well and all according to plan."

Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.
First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues.
Prior to that, she was CFO for MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.
The second news update, I'm please to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017 through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.
Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. 
Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.
Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on Slide 3.
We continue to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining cost at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year but still in line with our 2016 guidance and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour of gold next month or about 2 months ahead of schedule.
We also continued to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.
Turning to Slide 4. Sending people home safely every day is a matter of principle and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the mining sector's top performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for 5 consecutive months without an injury. It was an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.
Turning to Slide 5 for more on that transition. We poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade of profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget as well as our successful exploration program.
Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.
Turning to Long Canyon on Slide 6. Construction is nearly complete, and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We're confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold price is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit and mineralization remains open in all directions.
Moving to the full portfolio on Slide 7. Even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 22% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs are slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook.
Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek and Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo.
Year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. 
We look forward to sharing our refreshed 5-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.
Turning to Slide 8. We positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund 5 projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining cost of less than $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.
I'll turn now to Slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes: receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB stake and PTNNT, a valid export license at closing. The current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,403309941,1063532,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's",982,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.
Now before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale, and as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operation.
Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated what happened, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide.
GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million noncash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operation and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13.
Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from releaching the pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior year quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 for a look at our third quarter financial performance. Increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost triple compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million.
Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth, and yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities.
This morning, we announced a $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With a total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.
Turning to net debt. We continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1x at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1x is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau, to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded, given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term, with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense, so we focus on a balance of the 2 efforts.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on Slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017.
The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior year quarter dividend.
The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date, and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. 
And repay debt -- we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation and returning cash to shareholders. As I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter, and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles.
With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results."

We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian.

We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Carlin and Boddington more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects.
Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory drawdowns in Africa, and some operational changes, including low grade deep transitional laws at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin surface mines.
Turning to our regional performance on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added Cyanide [ph] to the leach of pad last week and we shoot Carbon [ph] to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies that pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. 
We've completed the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected, and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case.
Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the northwest. Work to install arrays [ph] and some ventilation equipment is underway, and this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip of the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North Area will impact fourth quarter production. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and have evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year so there's no impact to longer-term production or costs.
We're making good progress at Leeville underground. We have fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof valves designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. Gary and I were in Suriname 2 weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha, through the potential development of Quecher Main to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have 3 drill rigs operating in that Chaquicocha decline, and the testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plan for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, walls preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. We started full potential in Australia nearly 4 years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May.
At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine at Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.
Finally, turning to Africa on Slide 19. The team in Ahafo continued to deliver a solid performance achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries. And Africa remains our lowest region for injuries.
Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I'll look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. 
With that, I'll return the call to Gary on Slide 20."
291795,403309941,1063532,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering",611,"Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering projects into production all the way out to our greenfield exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance, and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana.
Turning to Slide 21. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. We'll also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles.
The Subika underground mine will produce ore grades that are 3x higher than the current surface mine grades and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with first production in 2018 and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.
Turning to Slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists.
Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013. At Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010. At Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003 and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. And finally at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 23. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment, and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals.
On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020, due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.
Turning to Slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last 3.5 years, and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. While we're not relying on rising gold prices, we're resting on our achievements. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.

We're not building that in our current guidance as we look into '17, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. 
I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, we -- it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results, whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit. The results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which -- with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up -- I don't think we've got it in the slide pack but in the last quarter slides, we had some cross-sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So I'm very encouraged there. 
And we continue to look Subiaco [ph] is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore, so it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance."

So I'm not surprised that it's coming in but that's coming in well. 
I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and the backhoe to help feed into the mill and that process is going well. I think early on here for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter -- actually, you're right at the surface, we've got roots and things from plant material. So some of that's come through, but I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing that they've had to manage with. I wouldn't say it was a surprise but just it add some complexity to the startup, but I think the startup and ramp-up has been going very well and all according to plan."

Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to",1203,"Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.
First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues.
Prior to that, she was CFO for MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.
The second news update, I'm pleased to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017 through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.
Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. 
Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.
Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on Slide 3.
We continued to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining costs at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year but still in line with our 2016 guidance and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour of gold next month or about 2 months ahead of schedule.
We also continued to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and, most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.
Turning to Slide 4. Sending people home safely every day is a matter of principle and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the mining sector's top performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for 5 consecutive months without an injury, which is an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.
Turning to Slide 5 for more on that transition. We poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade of profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget as well as our successful exploration program.
Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.
Turning to Long Canyon on Slide 6. Construction is nearly complete, and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We are confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold price is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit and mineralization remains open in all directions.
Moving to the full portfolio on Slide 7. Even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 22% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs are slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook.
Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek and Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo.
Year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. 
We look forward to sharing our refreshed 5-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.
Turning to Slide 8. We positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund 5 projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining cost of less than $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.
I'll turn now to Slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes: receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB's stake and PTNNT, a valid export license at closing. The current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,403309941,1063933,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's",982,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.
Now before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale, and as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operation.
Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated what happened, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide.
GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million noncash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operation and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13.
Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from releaching the pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior year quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 for a look at our third quarter financial performance. Increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost triple compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million.
Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth, and yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities.
This morning, we announced a $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With a total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.
Turning to net debt. We continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1x at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1x is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau, to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded, given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term, with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense, so we focus on a balance of the 2 efforts.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on Slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017.
The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior year quarter dividend.
The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date, and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. 
And repay debt -- we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation and returning cash to shareholders. As I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter, and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles.
With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results."

We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Ca",710,"Thanks, Laurie. We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Carlin and Boddington more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects.
Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory drawdowns in Africa, and some operational changes, including lower grade deep transitional laws at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin surface mines.
Turning to our regional performance on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added cyanide to the leach of pad last week and we shipped carbon to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies that pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. 
We have completed the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected, and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case.
Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the northwest. Work to install arrays and some ventilation equipment is underway, and this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip of the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North Area will impact fourth quarter production. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and have evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year so there's no impact to longer-term production or costs.
We're making good progress at Leeville underground. We have fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof valves designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. Gary and I were in Suriname 2 weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha, through the potential development of Quecher Main to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have 3 drill rigs operating in that Chaquicocha decline, and are testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plan for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. We started full potential in Australia nearly 4 years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May.
At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering, procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine at Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.
Finally, turning to Africa on Slide 19. Akyem and Ahafo continued to deliver a solid performance achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries, and Africa remains our lowest region for injuries.
Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika Underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. 
With that, I'll return the call to Gary on Slide 20."

Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering",612,"Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering projects into production all the way out to our greenfields exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance, and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana.
Turning to Slide 21. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs. It would also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles.
The Subika underground mine will produce ore grades that are 3x higher than the current surface mine grades and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with first production in 2018 and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.
Turning to Slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists.
Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013. At Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010. At Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003 and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. And finally at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 23. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment, and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals.
On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020, due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.
Turning to Slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last 3.5 years, and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. While we're not relying on rising gold prices, we're resting on our achievements. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.

We're not building that in, in our current guidance as we look into '17, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. 
I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, we -- it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results, whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit. The results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which -- with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up -- I don't think we've got it in the slide pack but in the last quarter slides, we had some cross-sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So I'm very encouraged there. 
And we continue to look, Subaiho [ph] is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore, so it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance."

So I'm not surprised that it's coming in but that's coming in well. 
I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and a backhoe to help feed into the mill and that process is going well. I think early on here for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter -- actually, you're right at the surface, where you've got roots and things from plant material. So some of that's come through, but I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing that they've had to manage with -- I wouldn't say it was a surprise but just it add some complexity to the startup, but I think the startup and ramp-up has been going very well and all according to plan."

Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to",1203,"Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.
First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues.
Prior to that, she was CFO for MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.
The second news update, I'm pleased to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017 through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.
Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. 
Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.
Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on Slide 3.
We continued to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining costs at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year but still in line with our 2016 guidance and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour of gold next month or about 2 months ahead of schedule.
We also continued to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and, most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.
Turning to Slide 4. Sending people home safely every day is a matter of principle and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the mining sector's top performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for 5 consecutive months without an injury, which is an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.
Turning to Slide 5 for more on that transition. We poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade of profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget as well as our successful exploration program.
Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.
Turning to Long Canyon on Slide 6. Construction is nearly complete, and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We are confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold price is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit and mineralization remains open in all directions.
Moving to the full portfolio on Slide 7. Even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 22% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs are slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook.
Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek and Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo.
Year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. 
We look forward to sharing our refreshed 5-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.
Turning to Slide 8. We positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund 5 projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining cost of less than $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.
I'll turn now to Slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes: receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB's stake and PTNNT, a valid export license at closing. The current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,403309941,1063939,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's",982,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.
Now before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale, and as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operation.
Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated what happened, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide.
GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million noncash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operation and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13.
Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from releaching the pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior year quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 for a look at our third quarter financial performance. Increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost triple compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million.
Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth, and yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities.
This morning, we announced a $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With a total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.
Turning to net debt. We continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1x at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1x is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau, to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded, given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term, with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense, so we focus on a balance of the 2 efforts.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on Slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017.
The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior year quarter dividend.
The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date, and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. 
And repay debt -- we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation and returning cash to shareholders. As I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter, and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles.
With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results."

We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Ca",710,"Thanks, Laurie. We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Carlin and Boddington more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects.
Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory drawdowns in Africa, and some operational changes, including lower grade deep transitional laws at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin surface mines.
Turning to our regional performance on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added cyanide to the leach of pad last week and we shipped carbon to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies that pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. 
We have completed the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected, and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case.
Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the northwest. Work to install arrays and some ventilation equipment is underway, and this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip of the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North Area will impact fourth quarter production. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and have evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year so there's no impact to longer-term production or costs.
We're making good progress at Leeville underground. We have fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof valves designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. Gary and I were in Suriname 2 weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha, through the potential development of Quecher Main to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have 3 drill rigs operating in that Chaquicocha decline, and are testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plan for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. We started full potential in Australia nearly 4 years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May.
At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering, procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine at Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.
Finally, turning to Africa on Slide 19. Akyem and Ahafo continued to deliver a solid performance achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries, and Africa remains our lowest region for injuries.
Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika Underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. 
With that, I'll return the call to Gary on Slide 20."

Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering",612,"Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering projects into production all the way out to our greenfields exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance, and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana.
Turning to Slide 21. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs. It would also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles.
The Subika underground mine will produce ore grades that are 3x higher than the current surface mine grades and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with first production in 2018 and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.
Turning to Slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists.
Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013. At Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010. At Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003 and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. And finally at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 23. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment, and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals.
On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020, due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.
Turning to Slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last 3.5 years, and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. While we're not relying on rising gold prices, we're resting on our achievements. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.

We're not building that in, in our current guidance as we look into '17, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. 
I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, we -- it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results, whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit. The results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which -- with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up -- I don't think we've got it in the slide pack but in the last quarter slides, we had some cross-sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So I'm very encouraged there. 
And we continue to look, Subaiho [ph] is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore, so it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance."

So I'm not surprised that it's coming in but that's coming in well. 
I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and a backhoe to help feed into the mill and that process is going well. I think early on here for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter -- actually, you're right at the surface, where you've got roots and things from plant material. So some of that's come through, but I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing that they've had to manage with -- I wouldn't say it was a surprise but just it add some complexity to the startup, but I think the startup and ramp-up has been going very well and all according to plan."

Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to",1203,"Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.
First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues.
Prior to that, she was CFO for MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.
The second news update, I'm pleased to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017 through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.
Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. 
Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.
Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on Slide 3.
We continued to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining costs at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year but still in line with our 2016 guidance and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour of gold next month or about 2 months ahead of schedule.
We also continued to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and, most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.
Turning to Slide 4. Sending people home safely every day is a matter of principle and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the mining sector's top performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for 5 consecutive months without an injury, which is an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.
Turning to Slide 5 for more on that transition. We poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade of profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget as well as our successful exploration program.
Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.
Turning to Long Canyon on Slide 6. Construction is nearly complete, and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We are confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold price is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit and mineralization remains open in all directions.
Moving to the full portfolio on Slide 7. Even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 22% since 2012. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs are slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook.
Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek and Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo.
Year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. 
We look forward to sharing our refreshed 5-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.
Turning to Slide 8. We positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund 5 projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining cost of less than $700 per ounce over the next 2 years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.
I'll turn now to Slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes: receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB's stake and PTNNT, a valid export license at closing. The current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,403309941,1064654,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's",982,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last 3 years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.
Now before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale, and as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operation.
Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated what happened, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide.
GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million noncash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operation and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13.
Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from releaching the pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior year quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 for a look at our third quarter financial performance. Increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost triple compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million.
Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth, and yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities.
This morning, we announced a $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With a total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.
Turning to net debt. We continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1x at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1x is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau, to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded, given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term, with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense, so we focus on a balance of the 2 efforts.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on Slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017.
The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior year quarter dividend.
The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on Slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date, and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. 
And repay debt -- we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation and returning cash to shareholders. As I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter, and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles.
With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results."

We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian.

We continued to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian. Producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek and Victor, Carlin and Boddington more than offset declining production at Yanacocha, and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects.
Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory drawdowns in Africa, and some operational changes, including lower grade deep transitional laws at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin surface mines.
Turning to our regional performance on Slide 16. As Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added cyanide to the leach of pad last week and we shipped carbon to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies that pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. 
We have completed the Cripple Creek and Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected, and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case.
Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the northwest. Work to install arrays and some ventilation equipment is underway, and this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip of the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North Area will impact fourth quarter production. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and have evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year so there's no impact to longer-term production or costs.
We're making good progress at Leeville underground. We have fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof valves designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.
Turning to South America on Slide 17. Gary and I were in Suriname 2 weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha, through the potential development of Quecher Main to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have 3 drill rigs operating in that Chaquicocha decline, and are testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plan for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.
Turning to Australia on Slide 18. We started full potential in Australia nearly 4 years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May.
At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering, procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine at Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.
Finally, turning to Africa on Slide 19. Akyem and Ahafo continued to deliver a solid performance achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries, and Africa remains our lowest region for injuries.
Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika Underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. 
With that, I'll return the call to Gary on Slide 20."

Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering",612,"Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a time frame for delivering projects into production all the way out to our greenfields exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance, and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana.
Turning to Slide 21. The Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs. It would also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles.
The Subika underground mine will produce ore grades that are 3x higher than the current surface mine grades and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with first production in 2018 and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.
Turning to Slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists.
Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013. At Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010. At Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003 and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. And finally at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 23. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment, and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals.
On the supply side, 3-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020, due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the 2 countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.
Turning to Slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last 3.5 years, and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. While we're not relying on rising gold prices, we're resting on our achievements. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business, and you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.
Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions."

We're not building that in, in our current guidance as we look into '17, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. 
I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, we -- it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results, whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit. The results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which -- with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up -- I don't think we've got it in the slide pack but in the last quarter slides, we had some cross-sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So I'm very encouraged there. 
And we continue to look, Subaiho [ph] is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore, so it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance."

And that's not unusual as your -- the upper parts of the ore body and the fringes to have found that but as we get in grade is reconciling very close to what we expected. As you may recall, when we announced the project, I talked about the fact we did an additional roughly $25 million worth of drilling to understand that ore body. So I'm not surprised that it's coming in but that's coming in well. 
I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and a backhoe to help feed into the mill and that process is going well. I think early on here for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter -- actually, you're right at the surface, where you've got roots and things from plant material. So some of that's come through, but I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing that they've had to manage with -- I wouldn't say it was a surprise but just it add some complexity to the startup, but I think the startup and ramp-up has been going very well and all according to plan."

Yanacocha Sulfides at the top is about a 2-year process to work that through pre-feas and on into definitive feasibility. Awonsu is -- and Apensu Deeps are really underground extensions around Ahafo. And that's -- really primarily a combination of drilling and how things work, that's probably in more the 2 to 3 years sort of a time frame. Ahafo North is more in the 3-year time frame as we work through the next stages for that project. Tanami Expansion 2, I would see in that same sort of 2-year to 3-year time frame so that -- well, 3 -- it says below 3 to 5 years at the bottom. And then Federation, the same thing it's really getting the extension. Tanami Expansion 2 by the way, is a shaft is what we're looking at for production there because the deposit extents so much at depth. But hopefully, that gives you an idea -- that was the idea putting the years at the bottom, 3 to 5 years as a general kind of a rule, but they all vary a little bit around there."
