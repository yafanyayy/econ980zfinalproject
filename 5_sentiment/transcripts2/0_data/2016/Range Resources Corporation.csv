Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million.

Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This one, in essence, results in 2 horizontal drilling rigs plus 1 rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that into perspective, we entered 2015 with 15 rigs. So for 2016, we have significantly reduced our activity and are primarily focused in Southwest Pennsylvania. This year, we're projecting lower well cost, better marketing contracts and lower unit costs. This strategy generates good returns and preserves our efficiencies by keeping a minimal level of activity. 
Concerning asset sales, we have a signed purchase and sale agreement for Bradford County assets for $112 million. Our assets there consist of approximately 20 million per day of net production and about 11,000 net acres, which is all operated by Repsol. This is our only outside operating position in the Marcellus. In addition, we're currently marketing our Central Oklahoma asset. It's also important to note and point out that we have approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity with no bond maturities due until 2021. 
For 2016, we have approximately 80% of our natural gas hedged [indiscernible]. Unit costs are projected to continue to decrease in 2016. With the proceeds from our Virginia asset sales used to reduced debt by 24%, our interest expense per Mcfe should be lower in 2016 than 2015. 
Our Virginia assets also had higher LOE per Mcfe as well as higher G&A and broker gas marketing expense. Given the sale of our Virginia assets last year, coupled with the closing of our Oklahoma City office, that production is in our field offices last year and a recent workforce reduction in our Pittsburgh area office and Forth Worth office, our headcount today is 31% lower than it was this time last year. 
Bottom line, we r projecting that on an absolute basis, interest expense, LOE and G&A will decline year-over-year. As you'll see from the release, transportation and gathering per Mcfe will increase, but given the better contracts and better price realizations, we're expecting improved net back pricing. 
The Mariner East pipeline better netbacks for both ethane and propane. Range is the only producer on Mariner East. We control a dominant portion of the capacity on the pipe and have considerable access for propane storage. With our unique contracts, we expect to generate significant pricing differentiation for these products going forward, especially during the summer of 2016. Given the full year of [indiscernible] Uniontown to Gas City transportation and better basis for our gas, which we have locked in a significant portion with hedging, we're expecting better natural gas netbacks to more than offset the increase. As an example, this project contributed to our $0.41 per Mcf price differential improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Our IR team has given more color for 2016 in our release. 
The capital efficiencies our team is achieving is very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range. We believe Range is the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per-lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. What's important is that we're drilling laterals of up to 1,000 feet longer with significantly lower cost, ranging from 14% to 20% less total well cost per lateral foot, including facilities. The EURs of these wells averaged 2.4 up the 3 Bcf per thousand foot. The absolute EURs are 16 Bcfe to 21 Bcf per well. Remember, we do have wells are significantly higher than the average. 
What's important is that the EURs per thousand foot of lateral are holding constant and we're achieving that performance in less time and with less cost resulting in improved capital efficiency. 
Lastly, I will summarize our reserve report for year-end 2015 that was released last night. Adjusting for asset sales last year, our reserves increased from year-end 2014. The drill-bit finding cost with provisions was $0.37 per Mcfe and our drill-bit replacement was 436% of production, including price and performance provision. Proved developed reserves increased from 52% to 55% in Marcellus reserves both 97% of the total. Although the SEC proved reserve net present value decreased due to the significant commodity price increase year-over-year, the year-end 2015 PV-10 value of the proved reserves using future script prices and current sales contracts is $6.8 billion, which is very comparable to the year-end 2014 value of $6.9 billion. The continuing strong PV-10 value is a result of continued capital efficiencies, reduced operating cost and improvement in netback pricing with the commencement of our most recent sales contracts and scheduled future contracts. For further comments on unit cost reductions, as well as the balance sheet, I will now turn the call over to Roger."

Range achieved consistent production growth, improved capital efficiency paired with significantly lower unit costs. Perhaps most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year with lower debt than we started. Over the past 2 years, production has increased 48%, while debt has been reduced by approximately $0.5 billion or 14%. 
Starting with the fourth quarter income statement. Higher production and lower-cost were no match for significantly lower year-over-year commodity prices. There were some bright spots, however. Cash margin during the fourth quarter was $1.52 an Mcfe, approximately 20% higher than the previous 2 quarters of this year. And both EBITDAX and cash flow were higher in the fourth quarter than the 2 preceding quarters of this year. 
Fourth quarter reporting a loss was $322 million, driven by a $409 million pretax loss on sale of assets and an $88 million pretax impairment of legacy in the continent proved reserves. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries, was $42 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $204 million and EBITDAX was $241 million, both slightly more than 20% below last year's fourth quarter figures due to 30% all-in lower realized prices. Fourth quarter cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.22. Cash flow and EBITDAX for the full year 2015 was $740 million and $897 million, respectively. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the full year 2015 was $4.45. 
There were a few unusual fourth quarter expense items that merit comment and while most expense categories came in at or below guidance, transportation, gathering and compression expense was $0.05 over guidance at $0.85 due to some new capacity coming on earlier than expected. 
Direct operating expense came in at $0.22, $0.06 under guidance, mainly due to a nonrecurring recent credit. 
Speaking of unusual and nonrecurring items, just to give everyone heads up. Next week, we will be filing a registration statement to exchange our 4 7/8 percent senior notes issued last year under Rule 144A with lifetime registered notes. We're also registering some shares that are already issued in the deferred compensation plan. This is an ordinary course of business administrative matter and it's being done immediately after the 10-K filing just the same accounting expense. There are no changes to the note terms. 
Our fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2016, and 1 item that you'll note in the guidance is the increase in projected gathering transportation and compression expense associated with commencement of the Mariner East project. As further discussed in earnings release and as evidenced in our fourth quarter margin improvement from the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, these new projects are expected to improve our margins by generating significantly higher revenue over the incremental cost. 
Another item of note in the earnings release is our decision to conserve cash by reducing our cash common stock dividend by half from a quarterly $0.04 a share to $0.02 a share. 
A highlight of every year's fourth quarter release is the annual reset of our DD&A rate, reflecting the results of the year-end audited proved reserve report. With heightened focus in capital efficiency, this year's results are especially significant. Our fourth quarter DD&A rate dropped to $0.97 per Mcfe, moving closer to our finding and development cost. With our total company recurring direct operating expense of approximately $0.26, the combined cost to recover our asset depreciation and produce our oil and gas was $1.23 in Mcfe. 
Our [indiscernible] Marcellus customers always assets haven't even lower DD&A rate and direct operating expense. But even using this $1.23 per Mcfe figure for the whole company, as recently as 2009, our combined total company DD&A rate and direct operating expense was $3.17, almost 3x today's figure. 
For the first quarter of last year, we closed our Oklahoma City office, which reduced our companywide headcount by approximately 8%. As Jeff mentioned, walking that event forward to today, asset sales and additional reductions in force have reduced our total headcount by 31%. While this has been extraordinarily difficult for an already lean organization, it demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to not just survive in the current downturn, but effectively position the company for the future whatever lies ahead. Because our realized be -- our realized price peaked in 2008, we are already over 7 years into a period that many are just now calling lower for longer. We already know what that phrase means and we know what that phrase means, we have to do. Besides, dramatically reducing headcount and high-grading our asset, there's another illustration of the type of positioning for the future I'm referring to. 
In our reserves release, you'll see that we have a $0.40 per Mcfe proved undeveloped conversion cost, a modest 0.4 well proved undeveloped, proved developed producing booking ratio. Meaning that for every PDP Marcellus well, we only have 0.4 PD wells offset booked. And you will note that our pot reserves are limited, not by economic value but by the FTC 5-year roll. Now not mentioned in the release is that we have 124 fully constructed and operational Marcellus drilling bed, holding 5 or fewer wells, with the most cases, room to drill up to 18 wells or more on each pad. Now this means that for every PUD well we convert to a PDP well, there's another 1 ready to book on our existing pad with already built on infrastructure. 
With 124 lightly drilled pads already constructed and tied in, we can economically grow reserves and production in this fashion for many years. Plus, we have another 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells on them and these pads have the same lower-for-longer economics. 
We included in the supplemental tables posted to the website a slide which takes the economics behind this illustration full cycle. Starting with our actual fourth quarter 2015 $1.26 per Mcfe total cash cost, then adding the $0.40 F&D cost, then adding our fourth quarter $0.35 per Mcfe basis differential. It totals to a basis adjusted all-in cost of $2.41 in Mcfe, which generates excellent margins against our $3.24 2006 hedged for price. 
But more importantly, this current all-in cost figure is more than covered by current strip prices in 2017 and beyond. But things get even more challenging, note that the $0.40 F&D cost number in the reserve report is an average across all the company's proved undeveloped locations. Actual F&D cost will vary by well type and location and we have the option to select from 183 existing pad sites, allowing us to optimize the development activity to match market conditions. 
Now Ray's going to illustration a bit more during his remarks in just a few moments. Positioning Range for 2017 for the recycle ratio over 1x, unhedged at current strip prices gives us confidence that we can continue to grow within cash flow even in this challenging environment. We believe that an underappreciated key metric to balance sheet preservation lies not in the looking down at ratio debt-to-EBITDAX, but then a forward-looking income statement ratio like the unhedged recycle ratio. 
If you're unhedged recycle ratio isn't above 1x, reducing debt or stockpiling cash only buys you time, it doesn't buy you success. This doesn't mean that we're ignoring the balance sheet, however. At year-end 2015, our bank credit facility balance outstanding was $95 million. That's down from $723 million at year-end 2014. Now we've got approximately $1.3 billion in current available liquidity. Our earliest bond maturities, as Jeff mentioned, is 2021. The weighted average interest rate on our bonds is 5 and 8 [ph] but our debt is 96%  fixed. We have class leading asset coverage with total debt per Mcfe of proved reserves of $0.23. And though we do not have a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at year end 2015 was a very respectable and manageable 3.0x. 
Lastly, our bands continue to trade well against our peer group before and after recent rating agency actions. Range currently has approximately 80% of our approximately 2016 gas production, hedged at a forward price of 3.24 Mmbtu. The earnings release contains a summary of our hedge positions for all commodities for 2016 and 2017. Additional more detailed hedged volumes and prices can be found on our website. 
In summary, though I realize commodity price has declined every year since 2008, 2015 was the first year where Range was unable to increase cash flow and cash flow per share through higher production and lower costs. And while some may say this signals the bottom and better times are ahead, we've aggressively responded to the 2015 cash flow decrease by reducing and optimizing growth, carefully deploying capital to our best return wells, shedding additional noncore asset, further lowering our cost structure, improving our capital efficiency, having our dividend, protect our liquidity and continuing to operate safely in an environmentally sound manner. Much has been accomplished in 2015 and there's much left to do, but we're confident in the future of Range and we're going to manage our finances accordingly. 
Ray, over to you."
93030,322271022,942043,"Range Resources Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Things, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling completions, which was 40% lower than the previous year and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This is a",2006,"Things, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling completions, which was 40% lower than the previous year and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This is a real testament to our team coupled with our high-quality and diverse asset base, meaning dry or liquids rich, what we believe our best-in-class capital efficiencies. 
Focusing on Southwest Pennsylvania for a few highlights from '15 as compared to '14. We saw our drilling cost per foot of lateral decreased by 21% while drilling 24% longer laterals. Our completions team increased the number of frac stages per frac per day by 31%. We achieved a 15% reduction in water cost or our completions operation. And with operational efficiencies and service cost reductions, we recognized an average 33% decrease in total completion cost per well. And importantly, we expect these improvements to continue. 
For this year, our total capital budget is $495 million. This plan represents a 45% reduction in total capital from '15 and a 69% reduction from 2014. Of that capital, 96% is directed towards drilling and completion with only $20 million in land. Essentially, all of our capital is directed towards the Marcellus with the majority of that being spent in Southwest PA. And you can find the details for all of that in our earnings release and in our updated presentation on the website. We're only spending about $18 million in Northeast PA this year which involves 14 wells coming online and a couple of wells drilled, which will be completed later. 
Our fourth quarter production came in at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 1.42 and our annual growth was right at 20% as forecasted. Production for the entire 2016 year is expected to average 1.39 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. This works out to 8% to 10% production growth for the year on a pro forma basis adjusted for asset sales. 
Production for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be approximately 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 32% liquids. This guidance accounts for the sale of the Virginia properties of $107 million a day on a pro forma basis on a pro forma basis would represent a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of '15. Importantly, we expect to see a higher exit rate at the end of 2016 than we started the year with after the asset sales. We'll also maintain an inventory of wells waiting on completion or tie-in is consistent with our reduced activity levels and also consistent with past years. This should set this up well going into 2017. 
Jeff touched on the longer laterals, lower cost and resulting capital efficiencies in his remarks and you can find details and the economics behind those in our updated presentation. And Roger talked about the fact that we have an inventory of pads all across the core of the core with the demonstrated ability to drill wells with substantially less cost per well. So let me take a minute and walk through our 3 areas in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania and work all of this in together. 
First, we've updated our 500-foot spacing test and our infill test in our updated presentation on Pages 40 and 41. Our tighter spacing projects now have almost 6 years of history and our infill project now has almost 2 years of data on the new inflow wells, both demonstrate success in our core acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania and we believe this is a distinct and unique advantage for Range. 
In the super-rich area, the 2016 wells are planned to average 6,700 feet, which will be 24% longer than last year, yet with the improved efficiencies and cost savings, the completed well cost will be about the same which is $5.9 million. 
Now I want to take a second here and remind everyone that all the costs that we discussed here are total completed well cost and do include all the facilities. We're projecting the 2016 super-rich wells to cost $881 per foot of lateral, which is a 20% improvement over 2015. We project our recoveries that to be 2.4 Bcf equivalent per 1000-foot of lateral. Said another way, we project spending $5.9 million to recover 16 Bcf equivalent, which equates to an F&D cost of $0.44 per Mcfe. Following Roger's earlier point, if these wells were drilled on existing pads, utilizing already existing infrastructure, including the pad, roads, facilities water and so forth, the total well cost would be significantly less and the F&D cost could then be as low as $0.38 per Mcfe. 
In the wet area, our 2016 wells are projected to have 7,000-foot laterals on average which is 17% longer than 2015. Given the increased efficiences on lower cost, the wet area wells are expected to cost $5.8 million or $832 per foot of lateral, which is a 16% improvement over 2015. These wells are projected to recover 3 Bcf equivalent per 1000-foot. Again, to summarize, we project spending $5.8 million to recover 21 Bcf equivalent which equals an F&D cost of $0.34 per Mcfe. Again, if these wells were drilled on existing pad, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.29 per Mcfe. The Southwest dry area wells in 2016 are expected to average slightly longer at 7,000 feet versus 6,800 feet last year. Significantly, the cost is projected to decrease from $6 million to $5.2 million. That's $743 per foot of lateral which is a 14% improvement over 2015. Again, a projected recovery of 17.6 Bcf per $5.2 million in the dry area equals an F&D cost of just $0.36 per Mcfe. If drilled on existing pads, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.27 per Mcfe. 
In summary, by drilling on existing pads, our F&D cost in Southwest Pennsylvania could be in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per Mcfe, which we believe would be the lowest in the play. As capital efficiency continues to improve throughout this year and beyond, we believe these F&D costs could go even lower, maybe as much as 10% lower, resulting in higher margins and even better recycle ratio for the company. 
Our inventory of existing pads on core acreage coupled with our continued improvement in capital efficiency and our low-cost structure give us a significant advantage in this low price environment. It positions us well for 2017 and we don't believe this is the case for everyone. Capital efficiency is our focus and we're recognizing it in many ways. For example, in looking at our current plan for 2016, we're putting online almost the same number of frac stages or if you say it another way, approximately the same amount of lateral feet for 43% less capital than we did last year, while maintaining some of the highest EURs per 1,000-foot recoveries in the basin. We can do this because of the high-quality resources in plays that Range has captured over the past 11 years of development in this core position. 
We believe these achievements are not likely outside the core. And we believe they are unique to Range. Along with improving efficiencies from 15% longer laterals, we're continuing to achieve decreases in service cost this year as compared to last year. Our operating efficiency is among the best in the basin. And we have no long-term commitments for services. As an example, on the completions front, we're averaging over 7 frac stages per day, per crew, resulting in severe debt and service pricing for Range while still generating acceptable margins for the service companies. We believe this provides another unique advantage for Range. 
On the marketing side, Range has added some capacity over the last 4 months that we're really excited about and that we've been discussing for quite some time. Of course, with this capacity comes cost. The biggest driver of the increase in transport expense for 2016 is related to Mariner East coming online in the first quarter as well as additional ATEX capacity for ethane. Mariner East is expected to bring us better netbacks on our 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. The project started the commissioning process for ethane in late 2015, commissioned the refrigeration system in January, then Range introduced ethane into the pipeline for the first time in February. And we expect to be loading the first ethane ship in a few days. 
We'll begin shipping F&D to INEOS and we'll also be to utilize VLGC, which are the largest ships available to ship propane while providing lower-cost transportation and better netbacks. As a result, NGL realizations are expected to improve from approximately 18% in 2015 to 24% in 2016. And NGL volumes increased substantially, approximately 30% over 2015. 
The resulting increased revenue far exceeds the additional NGL transport expense, thus improving cash flow. On the gas front, we had a full quarter quarter of the pipeline project, Uniontown to Gas City, by Spectre Energy. We'll have a full year of this for 2016 and this capacity is part of the reason for the improvement in our natural gas differentials when looking at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or when looking at 2016 versus 2015. This project allows us access to markets in the Midwest and achieves pricing that is better than NYMEX. 
Fourth quarter 2015 natural gas differentials were $0.41 better than the third quarter and full-year 2016 is expected to be $0.10 better than full-year 2015 differentials. These premium transport additions set us up well to improve our relative pricing for 2016 and beyond for both NGLs and natural gas. Next, I like to bring up to speed on our Utica wells. We're currently completing our third well as we speak. There's a 5800-foot laterals completed with 38 frac stages, averaging GBP 500,000 of profit per stage, which is 50-50, hundred mesh and premium 4070. The well will be flowed back, tested and put on production under a managed pressure program and we will not be trying to achieve a headline rate. The well is currently forecast to come in around $17 million, including the production facilities. We're currently cleaning up the well for the initial flow back and then we'll be building production facilities.  Planning to turn the well to sales prior to the end of the second quarter. 
We believe that our next well's total cost, again, including all the production facilities, would be in the range of $12 million per 6,500-foot lateral. And we estimate a well with an 8,000-foot lateral would come in at approximately $14 million. The EUR of our first well remains in the range of 15 Bcf gross and the second well is still expected to be better than that. We're encouraged by these early result and we see potential for further enhancements both in cost and in performance. However, in looking at the cost per 1,000-foot of lateral, even on the next wells, we're in the $1.8 million range as compared to $743,000 in our Southwest PA dry Marcellus acreage. 
In similar terms, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus while achieving about the same production. While the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated deficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells far exceed the Utica. Given limited production history thus far on  a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Over time, we expect that the Utica can be a commentary development opportunity, but for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor these wells along with offset wells, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible and we'll continue to work to lower cost and improve capital efficiency. Now back to Jeff."

The $0.40 number that we have in the slighted we posted, again, this company's average F&D just to convert the plants. In my illustration was there that since you've taken about 1.2 T's of PUDs, they're economic off your books because of the 5-year rule, to the extent you go back in there and pop a pud an convert it on existing pad. You just move another well on to it to take its place. So the $0.40 covers all the PUDs booked across the entire company. And as Ray mentioned, in some of the areas and Marcellus, the drag is that number is down in the low 20s. So while the price is going to move and fluctuate, to your point, we can work the throttle and work that to F&D costs as well. So that's a key variable for us. As for the 37% dry gas. I mean, we've got some infrastructure coming on in the dry gas gathering side. That will allow us to ramp that of going forward.

93030,322271022,942319,"Range Resources Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will, in essence, result in 2 horizontal drilling rigs plus 1 air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in pers",828,"Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will, in essence, result in 2 horizontal drilling rigs plus 1 air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in perspective, we entered 2015 with 15 rigs. So for 2016, we have significantly reduced our activity and are primarily focused in Southwest Pennsylvania. This year, we're projecting lower well cost, better marketing contracts and lower unit costs. This strategy generates good returns and preserves our efficiencies by keeping a minimal level of activity. 
Concerning asset sales, we have a signed purchase and sale agreement for our Bradford County assets for $112 million. Our assets there consist of approximately 20 million per day of net production and about 11,000 net acres, which is all operated by Repsol. This is our only outside-operated position in the Marcellus. In addition, we're currently marketing our central Oklahoma assets. It's also important to note and point out that we have approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity with no bond maturities due until 2021. For 2016, we have approximately 80% of our natural gas hedged at a floor of $3.24.
Unit costs are projected to continue to decrease into 2016. With the proceeds from our Virginia assets sale used to reduced debt by 24%, our interest expense per Mcfe should be lower in 2016 than 2015. Our Virginia assets also had higher LOE per Mcfe as well as higher G&A and brokered gas marketing expense. Given the sale of our Virginia assets last year, coupled with the closing of our Oklahoma City office, [indiscernible] productions is in our field offices last year and a recent workforce reduction in our Pittsburgh area office and in Forth Worth office, our headcount today is 31% lower than it was this time last year. 
Bottom line, we're projecting that on an absolute basis, interest expense, LOE and G&A will decline year-over-year. As you'll see from the release, transportation and gathering per Mcfe will increase, but given the better contracts and better price realizations, we're expecting improved netback pricing. 
The Mariner East pipeline is expected to result in better netbacks for both ethane and propane. Range is the only producer on Mariner East. We control a dominant portion of the capacity on the pipe and have considerable access for propane cavern storage. With our unique contracts, we expect to generate significant pricing differentiation for these products going forward, especially during the summer of 2016.
Given a full year of Spectra Uniontown to Gas City transportation and better basis for our gas, which we have locked in a significant portion with hedging, we're expecting better natural gas netbacks to more than offset the increase. As an example, this project contributed to our $0.41 per Mcf price differential improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Our IR team has given more color for 2016 in our release. 
The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per-lateral foot in the southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. What's important is that we're drilling laterals that are up to 1,000 feet longer with significantly lower cost, ranging from 14% to 20% less total well cost per lateral foot, including facilities. The EURs of these wells average 2.4 up to 3 Bcf per thousand foot. The absolute EURs are 16 Bcfe to 21 Bcf per well. Remember, we do have wells that are significantly higher than the averages. What's important is that the EURs per thousand foot of lateral are holding constant, and we're achieving that performance in less time and with less cost, resulting in improved capital efficiency. 
Lastly, I will summarize our reserve report for year-end 2015 that was released last night. Adjusting for asset sales last year, our reserves increased from year-end 2014. The drill-bit finding cost with provisions was $0.37 per Mcfe, and our drill-bit replacement was 436% of production, including price and performance revision. Proved developed reserves increased from 52% to 55% in Marcellus reserves [indiscernible] 97% of the total. Although the SEC proved reserve net present value decreased due to the significant commodity price decrease year-over-year, the year-end 2015 PV-10 value of the proved reserves using future script prices and current sales contracts is $6.8 billion, which is very comparable to the year-end 2014 value of $6.9 billion. The continuing strong PV-10 value is a result of continued capital efficiencies, reduced operating cost and improvement in netback pricing with the commencement of our most recent sales contracts and scheduled future contracts.
For further comments on our unit cost reductions as well as the balance sheet, I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

Range achieved consistent production growth, improved capital efficiency paired with significantly lower unit costs. Perhaps most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year with lower debt than we started. Over the past 2 years, production has increased 48%, while debt has been reduced by approximately $0.5 billion or 14%. 
Starting with the fourth quarter income statement. Higher production and lower costs were no match for significantly lower year-over-year commodity prices. There were some bright spots, however. Cash margin during the fourth quarter was $1.52 an Mcfe, approximately 20% higher than the previous 2 quarters of this year. And both EBITDAX and cash flow were higher in the fourth quarter than the 2 preceding quarters of this year.
Fourth quarter reporting net loss was $322 million, driven by a $409 million pretax loss on sale of assets and an $88 million pretax impairment of legacy Midcontinent proved reserves. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries, was $42 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $204 million and EBITDAX was $241 million, both slightly more than 20% below last year's fourth quarter figures due to 30% all-in lower-realized prices. Fourth quarter cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.22. Cash flow and EBITDAX for the full year 2015 was $740 million and $897 million, respectively. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the full year 2015 was $4.45.
There were a few unusual fourth quarter expense items that merit comment. And while most expense categories came in at or below guidance, transportation, gathering and compression expense was $0.05 over guidance at $0.85 due to some new capacity coming on earlier than expected. Direct operating expense came in at $0.22, $0.06 under guidance, mainly due to a nonrecurring recent credit. 
Speaking of unusual and nonrecurring items, just to give everyone a heads-up, next week, we will be filing a registration statement to exchange our 4 7/8% senior notes issued last year under Rule 144A, with like-kind registered notes. We're also registering some shares that are already issued in the deferred compensation plan. This is an ordinary course of business administrative matter, and it's being done immediately after the 10-K filing, just to save accounting expense. There are no changes to the note terms. 
Our fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2016. And 1 item that you'll note in the guidance is the increase in projected gathering transportation and compression expense associated with commencement of the Mariner East project. As further discussed in the earnings release and as evidenced in our fourth quarter margin improvement from the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, these new projects are expected to improve our margins by generating significantly higher revenue over the incremental cost. 
Another item of note in the earnings release is our decision to conserve cash by reducing our cash common stock dividend by half from a quarterly $0.04 a share to $0.02 a share. 
A highlight of every year's fourth quarter release is the annual reset of our DD&A rate, reflecting the results of the year-end audited proved reserve report. With heightened focus on capital efficiency, this year's results are especially significant. Our fourth quarter DD&A rate dropped to $0.97 per Mcfe, moving closer to our finding and development cost. With our total company recurring direct operating expense of approximately $0.26, the combined cost to recover our asset depreciation and produce our oil and gas was $1.23 an Mcfe. 
Our dry gas Marcellus assets have an even lower DD&A rate and direct operating expense. But even using this $1.23 per Mcfe figure for the whole company, as recently as 2009, our combined total company DD&A rate and direct operating expense was $3.17, almost 3x today's figure. 
For the first quarter of last year, we closed our Oklahoma City office, which reduced our company-wide headcount by approximately 8%. As Jeff mentioned, walking that event forward to today, asset sales and additional reductions in force have reduced our total headcount by 31%. While this has been extraordinarily difficult for an already lean organization, it demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to not just survive in the current downturn but effectively position the company for the future whatever lies ahead. Because our realized peak -- our realized price peaked in 2008, we are already over 7 years into a period that many are just now calling lower for longer. We already know what that phrase means, and we know what that phrase means we have to do.
Besides dramatically reducing headcount and high-grading our assets, here's another illustration of the type of positioning for the future I'm referring to. In our reserves release, you'll see that we have a $0.40 per Mcfe proved undeveloped conversion cost, a modest 0.4 well proved undeveloped, proved developed producing booking ratio. Meaning that for every PDP Marcellus well, we'd only have 0.4 PD wells offset booked. And you will note that our PUD reserves are limited, not by economic value but by the SEC 5-year roll. Now not mentioned in the release is that we have 124 fully constructed and operational Marcellus drilling bed holding 5 or fewer wells, within most cases room to drill up to 18 wells or more on each pad. Now this means that for every PUD well we convert to a PDP well, there is another one ready to book on our existing pad with already built-on infrastructure. 
With 124 lightly drilled pads already constructed and tied in, we can economically grow reserves and production in this fashion for many years. Plus, we have another 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells on them, and these pads have the same lower-for-longer economics. 
We included in the supplemental tables, posted to the website, a slide which takes the economics behind this illustration full cycle. Starting with our actual fourth quarter 2015 $1.66 per Mcfe total cash cost, then adding the $0.40 F&D cost, then adding our fourth quarter $0.35 an Mcfe basis differential, it totals to a basis adjusted all-in cost of $2.41 an Mcfe, which generates excellent margins against our $3.24 2006 hedged floor price. 
But more importantly, this current all-in cost figure is more than covered by current strip prices in 2017 and beyond. But if things get even more challenging, note that the $0.40 F&D cost number in the reserve report is an average across all the company's proved undeveloped locations. Actual F&D cost will vary by well type and location, and we have the option to select from 183 existing pad sites, allowing us to optimize the development activity to match market conditions. 
Now Ray's going to unpack this illustration a bit more during his remarks in just a few moments. Positioning Range for 2017 for the recycle ratio over 1x unhedged at current strip prices gives us confidence that we can continue to grow within cash flow even in this challenging environment. We believe that an underappreciated key metric to balance sheet preservation lies not in the rearward looking down at ratio debt-to-EBITDAX but in a forward-looking income statement ratio, like the unhedged recycle ratio.
If your unhedged recycle ratio isn't above 1x, reducing debt or stockpiling cash only buys you time. It doesn't buy you success. This doesn't mean that we're ignoring the balance sheet however. At year-end 2015, our bank credit facility balance outstanding was $95 million. That's down from $723 million at year-end 2014. We've got approximately $1.3 billion in current available liquidity. Our earliest bond maturities, as Jeff mentioned, is 2021. The weighted average interest rate on our bonds is 5 1/8%, and our debt is 96%  fixed. We have class-leading asset coverage with total debt per Mcfe of proved reserves of $0.23. And though we do not have a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at year-end 2015 was a very respectable and manageable 3.0x. 
Lastly, our bonds continue to trade well against our peer group before and after recent rating agency actions. Range currently has approximately 80% of our estimated 2016 gas production, hedged at a floor price of $3.24 an Mmbtu. The earnings release contains a summary of our hedge positions for all commodities, both 2016 and 2017. Additional more detailed hedged volumes and prices can be found on our website. 
In summary, though I realize commodity price has declined every year since 2008, 2015 was the first year where Range was unable to increase cash flow and cash flow per share through higher production and lower costs. And while some may say this signals the bottom and better times are ahead, we've aggressively responded to the 2015 cash flow decrease by reducing and optimizing growth, carefully deploying capital to our best-return wells, shedding additional noncore assets, further lowering our cost structure, improving our capital efficiency, having our dividend, protecting our liquidity and continuing to operate safely in an environmentally sound manner. Much has been accomplished in 2015, and there's much left to do, but we're confident that the future of -- in the future of Range, and we're going to manage our finances accordingly. 
Ray, over to you."

In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling and completion, which was 40% lower than the previous year, and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth, even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This",2011,"Things, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling and completion, which was 40% lower than the previous year, and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth, even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This is a real testament to our team, coupled with our high-quality and diverse asset base, meaning dry or liquids-rich, and what we believe are best-in-class capital efficiencies. 
Focusing on Southwest Pennsylvania for a few highlights from '15 as compared to '14. We saw our drilling cost per foot of lateral decreased by 21% while drilling 24% longer laterals. Our completions team increased the number of frac stages per frac crew per day by 31%. We achieved a 15% reduction in water cost or our completions operation. And with operational efficiencies and service cost reductions, we recognized an average 33% decrease in total completion cost per well. And importantly, we expect these improvements to continue. 
For this year, our total capital budget is $495 million. This plan represents a 45% reduction in total capital from '15 and a 69% reduction from 2014. Of that capital, 96% is directed towards drilling and completion, with only $20 million in land. Essentially, all of our capital is directed towards the Marcellus with the majority of that being spent in Southwest PA. And you can find the details for all of that in our earnings release and in our updated presentation on the website. We're only spending about $18 million in northeast PA this year, which involves 14 wells coming online and a couple of wells drilled, which will be completed later. 
Our fourth quarter production came in at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 1.42, and our annual growth was right at 20% as forecasted. Production for the entire 2016 year is expected to average 1.39 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. This works out to 8% to 10% production growth for the year on a pro forma basis adjusted for asset sales. 
Production for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be approximately 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 32% liquids. This guidance accounts for the sale of the Virginia properties of $107 million a day on a pro forma basis, and on a pro forma basis would represent a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of '15. Importantly, we expect to see a higher exit rate at the end of 2016 than we started the year with after the asset sale. We'll also maintain an inventory of wells waiting on completion or tie-in that is consistent with our reduced activity levels and also consistent with past years. This should set us up well going into 2017. 
Jeff touched on the longer laterals, lower cost and resulting capital efficiencies in his remarks, and you can find details and the economics behind those in our updated presentation. And Roger talked about the fact that we have an inventory of pads all across the core of the core with the demonstrated ability to drill wells with substantially less cost per well. So let me take a minute and walk through our 3 areas in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania and work all of this in together. 
First, we've updated our 500-foot spacing test and our infill test in our updated presentation on Pages 40 and 41. Our tighter-spacing projects now have almost 6 years of history, and our infill project now has almost 2 years of data on the new inflow wells, both demonstrate success in our core acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania, and we believe this is a distinct and unique advantage for Range. 
In the super-rich area, the 2016 wells are planned to average 6,700 feet, which will be 24% longer than last year. Yet with the improved efficiencies and cost savings, the completed well cost will be about the same, which is $5.9 million. 
Now I want to take a second here and remind everyone that all the costs that we discussed here are total completed well cost and do include all the facilities. We're projecting the 2016 super-rich wells to cost $881 per foot of lateral, which is a 20% improvement over 2015. We project the recoveries that to be 2.4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot of lateral. Said another way, we project spending $5.9 million to recover 16 Bcf equivalent, which equates to an F&D cost of $0.44 per Mcfe. Following Roger's earlier point, if these wells were drilled on existing pads, utilizing already existing infrastructure, including the pad, roads, facilities water and so forth, the total well cost would be significantly less and the F&D cost could then be as low as $0.38 per Mcfe. 
In the wet area, our 2016 wells are projected to have 7,000-foot laterals on average, which is 17% longer than 2015. Given the increased efficiences and lower cost, the wet area wells are expected to cost $5.8 million or $832 per foot of lateral, which is a 16% improvement over 2015. These wet wells are projected to recover 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot. Again to summarize, we project spending $5.8 million to recover 21 Bcf equivalent, which equals an F&D cost of $0.34 per Mcfe. Again, if these wells were drilled on existing pad, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.29 per Mcfe.
The southwest dry area wells in 2016 are expected to average slightly longer at 7,000 feet versus 6,800 feet last year. Significantly, the cost is projected to decrease from $6 million to $5.2 million. That's $743 per foot of lateral, which is a 14% improvement over 2015. Again, a projected recovery of 17.6 Bcf per $5.2 million in the dry area equals an F&D cost of just $0.36 per Mcfe. If drilled on existing pads, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.27 per Mcfe. 
In summary, by drilling on existing pads, our F&D cost in Southwest Pennsylvania could be in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per Mcfe, which we believe would be the lowest in the play. As capital efficiency continues to improve throughout this year and beyond, we believe these F&D costs could go even lower, maybe as much as 10% lower, resulting in higher margins and even better recycle ratio for the company. 
Our inventory of existing pads on core acreage coupled with our continued improvement in capital efficiency and our low-cost structure give us a significant advantage in this low-price environment. It positions us well for 2017, and we don't believe this is the case for everyone.
Capital efficiency is our focus, and we're recognizing it in many ways. For example, in looking at our current plan for 2016, we're putting online almost the same number of frac stages or, if you say it another way, approximately the same amount of lateral feet for 43% less capital than we did last year, while maintaining some of the highest EURs per 1,000-foot recoveries in the basin. We can do this because of the high-quality resource and plays that Range has captured over the past 11 years of development in its core position. We believe these achievements are not likely outside the core. And we believe they are unique to Range.
Along with improving efficiencies from 15% longer laterals, we're continuing to achieve decreases in service costs this year as compared to last year. Our operating efficiency is among the best in the basin, and we have no long-term commitments for services. As an example, on the completions front, we're averaging over 7 frac stages per day, per crew, resulting in some very attractive service pricing for Range, while still generating acceptable margins for the service companies. We believe this provides another unique advantage for Range. 
On the marketing side, Range has added some capacity over the last 4 months that we're really excited about and that we've been discussing for quite some time. Of course, with this capacity comes cost. The biggest driver of the increase in transport expense for 2016 is related to Mariner East coming online in the first quarter as well as additional ATEX capacity for ethane. Mariner East is expected to bring us better netbacks on our 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. The project started the commissioning process for ethane in late 2015, commissioned the refrigeration system in January, then Range introduced ethane into the pipeline for the first time in February. And we expect to be loading the first ethane ship in a few days.
We'll begin shipping ethane to INEOS, and we'll also be able to utilize VLGCs, which are the largest ships available, to ship propane while providing lower-cost transportation and better netbacks. As a result, NGL realizations are expected to improve from approximately 18% in 2015 to 24% in 2016. And NGL volumes increased substantially, approximately 30% over 2015. 
The resulting increased revenue far exceeds the additional NGL transport expense, thus improving cash flow. On the gas front, we had a full quarter of the pipeline project, Uniontown to Gas City, by Spectra Energy. We'll have a full year of this for 2016, and this capacity is part of the reason for the improvement in our natural gas differentials when looking at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or when looking at 2016 versus 2015. This project allows us access to markets in the Midwest and achieves pricing that is better than NYMEX. 
Fourth quarter 2015 natural gas differentials were $0.41 better than the third quarter, and full year 2016 is expected to be $0.10 better than full year 2015 differentials. These premium transport additions set us up well to improve our relative pricing for 2016 and beyond for both NGLs and natural gas.
Next, I'd like to bring up to speed on our Utica wells. We're currently completing our third well as we speak. It is a 5,800-foot lateral completed with 38 frac stages averaging 500,000 pounds of proppant per stage, which is 50-50 100 mesh and premium 40-70. The well will be flowed back, tested and put on production under a managed pressure program, and we will not be trying to achieve a headline rate. The well is currently forecast to come in around $17 million, including the production facilities. We're currently cleaning up the well for the initial flowback and then we'll be building production facilities. Planning to turn the well to sales prior to the end of the second quarter. 
We believe that our next well's total cost, again, including all the production facilities, would be in the range of $12 million per 6,500-foot lateral. And we estimate a well with an 8,000-foot lateral would come in at approximately $14 million. The EUR of our first well remains in the range of 15 Bcf gross, and the second well is still expected to be better than that. We're encouraged by these early results, and we see potential for further enhancements, both in cost and in performance. However, in looking at the cost per 1,000-foot of lateral, even on the next wells, we're in the $1.8 million range as compared to $743,000 in our Southwest PA dry Marcellus acreage.
In simpler terms, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus while achieving about the same production. While the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells far exceed the Utica. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment.
Over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor these wells along with offset wells, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible, and we'll continue to work to lower cost and improve capital efficiency.
Now, back to Jeff."

I think we announced that we had a long-term agreement with Mercury. They have a global presence, and they're helping us and advising us on selling propane into the international market. So since we announced that arrangement with them, we've locked in the R between mainly Europe and what Mont Belvieu prices were. So with that R blocked in, for all of '16 and part of '17, we've captured that value. It's much better than Mont Belvieu. So it's much better than Mont Belvieu, and it's better than gas that we could get on the gas price equivalent basis. Of late, you've watched freight -- the Baltic Index and freight cost come way down. This time last year, they were about equivalent of about $0.12 to $0.14 a gallon. You can currently get freight rate Baltic index quote of about $0.035 to $0.04 a gallon. So the freight rates have played into our hand as well.

And my illustration was there that since you've taken about 1.2 Ts of PUDs that are economic off your books because of the 5-year rule, to the extent you go back in there and pop a PUD an convert it on existing pad, you just move another well on to it to take its place. So the $0.40 covers all the PUDs booked across the entire company. And as Ray mentioned, in some of the areas, the Marcellus, like the dry gas, that number is down on the low 20s. So while the strip price is going to move and fluctuate, to your point, we can work the throttle and work that to F&D costs as well. So that's a key variable for us. As for the 37% dry gas, I mean we've got some infrastructure coming on, on the dry gas gathering side that will allow us to ramp that of going forward. But again, it's sort of -- those are kind of game-time decisions as we look across the portfolio and Ray's team looks at having the optionality on 183 existing pads, do I want to drill a super-rich, do I want to drill wet, or do I want to drill dry, we have other contracts besides MarkWest in Southwest PA. So a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables and it's just a matter of optimizing. But I think the key is having been discovered the play and having been there for 11 years, we got first-mover advantage of having just a whole lot more optimality in how we move forward in a tough environment."

It increases the cost, but it also our basis differential improves both in 2016 midpoint of around $0.42.

93030,322271022,942721,"Range Resources Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will, in essence, result in 2 horizontal drilling rigs plus 1 air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in pers",828,"Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will, in essence, result in 2 horizontal drilling rigs plus 1 air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in perspective, we entered 2015 with 15 rigs. So for 2016, we have significantly reduced our activity and are primarily focused in Southwest Pennsylvania. This year, we're projecting lower well cost, better marketing contracts and lower unit costs. This strategy generates good returns and preserves our efficiencies by keeping a minimal level of activity. 
Concerning asset sales, we have a signed purchase and sale agreement for our Bradford County assets for $112 million. Our assets there consist of approximately 20 million per day of net production and about 11,000 net acres, which is all operated by Repsol. This is our only outside-operated position in the Marcellus. In addition, we're currently marketing our central Oklahoma assets. It's also important to note and point out that we have approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity with no bond maturities due until 2021. For 2016, we have approximately 80% of our natural gas hedged at a floor of $3.24.
Unit costs are projected to continue to decrease into 2016. With the proceeds from our Virginia assets sale used to reduced debt by 24%, our interest expense per Mcfe should be lower in 2016 than 2015. Our Virginia assets also had higher LOE per Mcfe as well as higher G&A and brokered gas marketing expense. Given the sale of our Virginia assets last year, coupled with the closing of our Oklahoma City office, staff reductions in our field offices last year and a recent workforce reduction in our Pittsburgh area office and in Fort Worth office, our headcount today is 31% lower than it was this time last year. 
Bottom line, we're projecting that on an absolute basis, interest expense, LOE and G&A will all decline year-over-year. As you'll see from the release, transportation and gathering per Mcfe will increase, but given the better contracts and better price realizations, we're expecting improved netback pricing. 
The Mariner East pipeline is expected to result in better netbacks for both ethane and propane. Range is the only producer on Mariner East. We control a dominant portion of the capacity on the pipe and have considerable access for propane cavern storage. With our unique contracts, we expect to generate significant pricing differentiation for these products going forward, especially during the summer of 2016.
Given a full year of Spectra Uniontown to Gas City transportation and better basis for our gas, which we have locked in a significant portion with hedging, we're expecting better natural gas netbacks to more than offset the increase. As an example, this project contributed to our $0.41 per Mcf price differential improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Our IR team has given more color for 2016 in our release. 
The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per-lateral foot in the southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. What's important is that we're drilling laterals that are up to 1,000 feet longer with significantly lower cost, ranging from 14% to 20% less total well cost per lateral foot, including facilities. The EURs of these wells average 2.4 up to 3 Bcf per thousand foot. The absolute EURs are 16 Bcfe to 21 Bcf per well. Remember, we do have wells that are significantly higher than the averages. What's important is that the EURs per thousand foot of lateral are holding constant, and we're achieving that performance in less time and with less cost, resulting in improved capital efficiency. 
Lastly, I will summarize our reserve report for year-end 2015 that was released last night. Adjusting for asset sales last year, our reserves increased from year-end 2014. The drill-bit finding cost with revisions was $0.37 per Mcfe, and our drill-bit replacement was 436% of production, including price and performance revision. Proved developed reserves increased from 52% to 55% and Marcellus reserves composed 97% of the total. Although the SEC proved reserve net present value decreased due to the significant commodity price decrease year-over-year, the year-end 2015 PV-10 value of the proved reserves using future strip prices and current sales contracts is $6.8 billion, which is very comparable to the year-end 2014 value of $6.9 billion. The continuing strong PV-10 value is a result of continued capital efficiencies, reduced operating cost and improvement in netback pricing with the commencement of our most recent sales contracts and scheduled future contracts.
For further comments on our unit cost reductions as well as the balance sheet, I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

Range achieved consistent production growth, improved capital efficiency paired with significantly lower unit costs. Perhaps most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year with lower debt than we started. Over the past 2 years, production has increased 48%, while debt has been reduced by approximately $0.5 billion or 14%. 
Starting with the fourth quarter income statement. Higher production and lower costs were no match for significantly lower year-over-year commodity prices. There were some bright spots, however. Cash margin during the fourth quarter was $1.52 an Mcfe, approximately 20% higher than the previous 2 quarters of this year. And both EBITDAX and cash flow were higher in the fourth quarter than the 2 preceding quarters of this year.
Fourth quarter reporting net loss was $322 million, driven by a $409 million pretax loss on sale of assets and an $88 million pretax impairment of legacy Midcontinent proved reserves. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries, was $42 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $204 million and EBITDAX was $241 million, both slightly more than 20% below last year's fourth quarter figures due to 30% all-in lower-realized prices. Fourth quarter cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.22. Cash flow and EBITDAX for the full year 2015 was $740 million and $897 million, respectively. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the full year 2015 was $4.45.
There were a few unusual fourth quarter expense items that merit comment. And while most all expense categories came in at or below guidance, transportation, gathering and compression expense was $0.05 over guidance at $0.85 due to some new capacity coming on earlier than expected. Direct operating expense came in at $0.22, $0.06 under guidance, mainly due to a nonrecurring $0.03 credit. 
Speaking of unusual and nonrecurring items, just to give everyone a heads-up, next week, we will be filing a registration statement to exchange our 4 7/8% senior notes issued last year under Rule 144A, with like-kind registered notes. We're also registering some shares that are already issued and in the deferred compensation plan. This is an ordinary course of business administrative matter, and it's being done immediately after the 10-K filing, just to save accounting expense. There are no changes to the note terms. 
Our fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2016. And 1 item that you'll note in the guidance is the increase in projected gathering transportation and compression expense associated with commencement of the Mariner East project. As further discussed in the earnings release and as evidenced in our fourth quarter margin improvement from the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, these new projects are expected to improve our margins by generating significantly higher revenue over the incremental cost. 
Another item of note in the earnings release is our decision to conserve cash by reducing our cash common stock dividend by half from a quarterly $0.04 a share to $0.02 a share. 
A highlight of every year's fourth quarter release is the annual reset of our DD&A rate, reflecting the results of the year-end audited proved reserve report. With heightened focus on capital efficiency, this year's results are especially significant. Our fourth quarter DD&A rate dropped to $0.97 per Mcfe, moving closer to our finding and development cost. With our total company recurring direct operating expense of approximately $0.26, the combined cost to recover our asset depreciation and produce our oil and gas was $1.23 an Mcfe. 
Our dry gas Marcellus assets have an even lower DD&A rate and direct operating expense. But even using this $1.23 per Mcfe figure for the whole company, as recently as 2009, our combined total company DD&A rate and direct operating expense was $3.17, almost 3x today's figure. 
For the first quarter of last year, we closed our Oklahoma City office, which reduced our company-wide headcount by approximately 8%. As Jeff mentioned, walking that event forward to today, asset sales and additional reductions in force have reduced our total headcount by 31%. While this has been extraordinarily difficult for an already lean organization, it demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to not just survive in the current downturn but effectively position the company for the future whatever lies ahead. Because our realized peak -- our realized price peaked in 2008, we are already over 7 years into a period that many are just now calling lower for longer. We already know what that phrase means, and we know what that phrase means we have to do.
Besides dramatically reducing headcount and high-grading our assets, here's another illustration of the type of positioning for the future I'm referring to. In our reserves release, you will see that we have a $0.40 per Mcfe proved undeveloped conversion cost, a modest 0.4 well proved undeveloped, proved developed producing booking ratio. Meaning that for every PDP Marcellus well, we'd only have 0.4 PUD wells offset booked. And you will note that our PUD reserves are limited, not by economic value but by the SEC 5-year roll. Now not mentioned in the release is that we have 124 fully constructed and operational Marcellus drilling pads holding 5 or fewer wells, with in most cases room to drill up to 18 wells or more on each pad. Now this means that for every PUD well we convert to a PDP well, there is another one ready to book on an existing pad with already built-out infrastructure. 
With 124 lightly drilled pads already constructed and tied in, we can economically grow reserves and production in this fashion for many years. Plus, we have another 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells on them, and these pads have the same lower-for-longer economics. 
We've included in the supplemental tables, posted to the website, a slide which takes the economics behind this illustration full cycle. Starting with our actual fourth quarter 2015 $1.66 per Mcfe total cash cost, then adding the $0.40 F&D cost, then adding our fourth quarter $0.35 an Mcfe basis differential, it totals to a basis adjusted all-in cost of $2.41 an Mcfe, which generates excellent margins against our $3.24 2006 hedged floor price. 
But more importantly, this current all-in cost figure is more than covered by current strip prices in 2017 and beyond. So if things get even more challenging, note that the $0.40 F&D cost number in the reserve report is an average across all the company's proved undeveloped locations. Actual F&D cost will vary by well type and location, and we have the option to select from 183 existing pad sites, allowing us to optimize the development activity to match market conditions. 
Now Ray's going to unpack this illustration a bit more during his remarks in just a few moments. Now positioning Range for 2017 with a recycle ratio over 1x unhedged at current strip prices gives us confidence that we can continue to grow within cash flow even in this challenging environment. We believe that an underappreciated key metric to balance sheet preservation lies not in the rearward looking balance-sheet ratio debt-to-EBITDAX but in a forward-looking income statement ratio, like the unhedged recycle ratio.
If your unhedged recycle ratio isn't above 1x, reducing debt or stockpiling cash only buys you time. It doesn't buy you success. This doesn't mean that we're ignoring the balance sheet however. At year-end 2015, our bank credit facility balance outstanding was $95 million. That's down from $723 million at year-end 2014. We've got approximately $1.3 billion in current available liquidity. Our earliest bond maturities, as Jeff mentioned, is 2021. The weighted average interest rate on our bonds is 5 1/8%, and our debt is 96%  fixed. We have class-leading asset coverage with total debt per Mcfe of proved reserves of $0.23. And though we do not have a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at year-end 2015 was a very respectable and manageable 3.0x. 
Lastly, our bonds continue to trade well against our peer group before and after recent rating agency actions. Range currently has approximately 80% of our estimated 2016 gas production hedged at a floor price of $3.24 an Mmbtu. The earnings release contains a summary of our hedge positions for all commodities, both 2016 and 2017. Additional more detailed hedged volumes and prices can be found on our website. 
In summary, though our realized commodity price has declined every year since 2008, 2015 was the first year where Range was unable to increase cash flow and cash flow per share through higher production and lower costs. And while some may say this signals the bottom and better times are ahead, we've aggressively responded to the 2015 cash flow decrease by reducing and optimizing growth, carefully deploying capital to our best-return wells, shedding additional noncore assets, further lowering our cost structure, improving our capital efficiency, halving our dividend, protecting our liquidity and continuing to operate safely in an environmentally sound manner. Much has been accomplished in 2015, and there is much left to do, but we're confident that the future of -- in the future of Range, and we're going to manage our finances accordingly. 
Ray, over to you."

This",2013,"Things, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling and completion, which was 40% lower than the previous year, and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth, even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This is a real testament to our team, coupled with our high-quality and diverse asset base, meaning dry or liquids-rich, and what we believe are best-in-class capital efficiencies. 
Focusing on Southwest Pennsylvania for a few highlights from '15 as compared to '14. We saw our drilling cost per foot of lateral decrease by 21% while drilling 24% longer laterals. Our completions team increased the number of frac stages per frac crew per day by 31%. We achieved a 15% reduction in water cost for our completions operation. And with operational efficiencies and service cost reductions, we recognized an average 33% decrease in total completion cost per well. And importantly, we expect these improvements to continue. 
For this year, our total capital budget is $495 million. This plan represents a 45% reduction in total capital from '15 and a 69% reduction from 2014. Of that capital, 96% is directed towards drilling and completion, with only $20 million in land. Essentially, all of our capital is directed towards the Marcellus with the majority of that being spent in Southwest PA. And you can find the details for all of that in our earnings release and in our updated presentation on the website. We're only spending about $18 million in Northeast PA this year, which involves 14 wells coming online and a couple of wells drilled, which will be completed later. 
Our fourth quarter production came in at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 1.42, and our annual growth was right at 20% as forecasted. Production for the entire 2016 year is expected to average 1.39 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. This works out to 8% to 10% production growth for the year on a pro forma basis adjusted for asset sales. 
Production for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be approximately 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 32% liquids. This guidance accounts for the sale of the Virginia properties of $107 million a day on a pro forma basis -- and on a pro forma basis would represent a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of '15. Importantly, we expect to see a higher exit rate at the end of 2016 than we started the year with after the asset sale. We'll also maintain an inventory of wells waiting on completion or tie-in that is consistent with our reduced activity levels and also consistent with past years. This should set us up well going into 2017. 
Jeff touched on the longer laterals, lower cost and resulting capital efficiencies in his remarks, and you can find the details and the economics behind those in our updated presentation. And Roger talked about the fact that we have an inventory of pads all across the core of the core with the demonstrated ability to drill wells with substantially less cost per well. So let me take a minute and walk through our 3 areas in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania and work all of this in together. 
First, we've updated our 500-foot spacing test and our infill test in our updated presentation on Pages 40 and 41. Our tighter-spacing projects now have almost 6 years of history, and our infill project now has almost 2 years of data on the new infill wells. Both demonstrate success in our core acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania, and we believe this is a distinct and unique advantage for Range. 
In the super-rich area, the 2016 wells are planned to average 6,700 feet, which will be 24% longer than last year. Yet with the improved efficiencies and cost savings, the completed well cost will be about the same, which is $5.9 million. 
Now I want to take a second here and remind everyone that all the costs that we discussed here are total completed well cost and do include all the facilities. We're projecting the 2016 super-rich wells to cost $881 per foot of lateral, which is a 20% improvement over 2015. We project the recoveries to be 2.4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot of lateral. Said another way, we project spending $5.9 million to recover 16 Bcf equivalent, which equates to an F&D cost of $0.44 per Mcfe. Following Roger's earlier point, if these wells were drilled on existing pads, utilizing already existing infrastructure, including the pad, roads, facilities, water and so forth, the total well cost would be significantly less and the F&D cost could then be as low as $0.38 per Mcfe. 
In the wet area, our 2016 wells are projected to have 7,000-foot laterals on average, which is 17% longer than 2015. Given the increased efficiencies and lower cost, the wet area wells are expected to cost $5.8 million or $832 per foot of lateral, which is a 16% improvement over 2015. These wet wells are projected to recover 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot. Again to summarize, we project spending $5.8 million to recover 21 Bcf equivalent, which equals an F&D cost of $0.34 per Mcfe. Again, if these wells were drilled on existing pad, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.29 per Mcfe.
The Southwest dry area wells in 2016 are expected to average slightly longer at 7,000 feet versus 6,800 feet last year. Significantly, the cost is projected to decrease from $6 million to $5.2 million. That's $743 per foot of lateral, which is a 14% improvement over 2015. Again, a projected recovery of 17.6 Bcf per $5.2 million in the dry area equals an F&D cost of just $0.36 per Mcfe. If drilled on existing pads, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.27 per Mcfe. 
In summary, by drilling on existing pads, our F&D cost in Southwest Pennsylvania could be in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per Mcfe, which we believe would be the lowest in the play. As capital efficiency continues to improve throughout this year and beyond, we believe these F&D costs could go even lower, maybe as much as 10% lower, resulting in higher margins and even better recycle ratio for the company. 
Our inventory of existing pads on core acreage coupled with our continued improvement in capital efficiency and our low-cost structure give us a significant advantage in this low-price environment. It positions us well for 2017, and we don't believe this is the case for everyone.
Capital efficiency is our focus, and we're recognizing it in many ways. For example, in looking at our current plan for 2016, we're putting online almost the same number of frac stages or, if you say it another way, approximately the same amount of lateral feet for 43% less capital than we did last year, while maintaining some of the highest EURs per 1,000-foot recoveries in the basin. We can do this because of the high-quality resource in place that Range has captured over the past 11 years of development in its core position. We believe these achievements are not likely outside the core. And we believe they are unique to Range.
Along with improving efficiencies from 15% longer laterals, we're continuing to achieve decreases in service costs this year as compared to last year. Our operating efficiency is among the best in the basin, and we have no long-term commitments for services. As an example, on the completions front, we're averaging over 7 frac stages per day, per crew, resulting in some very attractive service pricing for Range, while still generating acceptable margins for the service companies. We believe this provides another unique advantage for Range. 
On the marketing side, Range has added some capacity over the last 4 months that we're really excited about and that we've been discussing for quite some time. Of course, with this capacity comes cost. The biggest driver of the increase in transport expense for 2016 is related to Mariner East coming online in the first quarter as well as additional ATEX capacity for ethane. Mariner East is expected to bring us better netbacks on our 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. The project started the commissioning process for ethane in late 2015, commissioned the refrigeration system in January, then Range introduced ethane into the pipeline for the first time in February. And we expect to be loading the first ethane ship in a few days.
We'll begin shipping ethane to INEOS, and we'll also be able to utilize VLGCs, which are the largest ships available, to ship propane while providing lower-cost transportation and better netbacks. As a result, NGL realizations are expected to improve from approximately 18% in 2015 to 24% in 2016. And NGL volumes increased substantially, approximately 30% over 2015. 
The resulting increased revenue far exceeds the additional NGL transport expense, thus improving cash flow. On the gas front, we had a full quarter of the pipeline project Uniontown to Gas City by Spectra Energy. We'll have a full year of this for 2016, and this capacity is part of the reason for the improvement in our natural gas differentials when looking at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or when looking at 2016 versus 2015. This project allows us access to markets in the Midwest and achieves pricing that is better than NYMEX. 
Fourth quarter 2015 natural gas differentials were $0.41 better than the third quarter, and full year 2016 is expected to be $0.10 better than full year 2015 differentials. These premium transport additions set us up well to improve our relative pricing for 2016 and beyond for both NGLs and natural gas.
Next, I'd like to bring you up to speed on our Utica wells. We're currently completing our third well as we speak. It's a 5,800-foot lateral completed with 38 frac stages averaging 500,000 pounds of proppant per stage, which is 50-50 100 mesh and premium 40-70. The well will be flowed back, tested and put on production under a managed pressure program, and we will not be trying to achieve a headline rate. The well is currently forecast to come in around $17 million, including the production facilities. We're currently cleaning up the well for the initial flowback and then we'll be building production facilities. Planning to turn the well to sales prior to the end of the second quarter. 
We believe that our next well's total cost, again, including all the production facilities, would be in the range of $12 million for a 6,500-foot lateral. And we estimate a well with an 8,000-foot lateral would come in at approximately $14 million. The EUR of our first well remains in the range of 15 Bcf gross, and the second well is still expected to be better than that. We're encouraged by these early results, and we see potential for further enhancements, both in cost and in performance. However, in looking at the cost per 1,000-foot of lateral, even on the next wells, we're in the $1.8 million range as compared to $743,000 in our Southwest PA dry Marcellus acreage.
In simpler terms, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus while achieving about the same production. While the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells far exceed the Utica. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment.
Over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor these wells along with offset wells, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible, and we'll continue to work to lower cost and improve capital efficiency.
Now, back to Jeff."

So it's much better than Mont Belvieu, and it's better than gas that we could get on the gas price equivalent basis.

Mariner East was not fully in service, it was not fully refrigerated. So we still were loading on what's called handy ships. Handy ships are smaller volumes. They can take about 150,000 barrels. So the per unit transportation cost is a little bit higher, which our netbacks were not as good as with Mariner East fully in service. Refrigeration is in service, and we can load the VLGC ships. But our main focus on marketing the propane once it's fully in service is either take advantage of the arbs between Europe, Asia and Mont Belvieu and/or the local markets. We can sell into the local markets in, for instance, the winter months when propane prices spike, if we get a polar vortex. So we have that optionality to be able to find the best price for the propane whatever time of the year it is, if that makes sense."

And you're exactly right. I share your enthusiasm for this ratio. I mean, we went through a period, where, in the old days, F&D costs really mattered. And then we went through this period, where everybody had oil and gas coming out of their ears and margins were great and then nobody really cared about it. It was all about margins. And now I think it's coming back into vogue and as it should be because in times like this, positive recycle ratio unhedged, as I mentioned, I think is -- it is the key to keeping things afloat. The $0.40 number that we have in the slide that we posted, again, that's company average F&D to just to convert the PUDs. And my illustration was there that since you've taken about 1.2 Ts of PUDs that are economic off your books because of the 5-year rule, to the extent you go back in there and pop a PUD and convert it on existing pad, you just move another well on to it to take its place. So but the $0.40 covers all the PUDs booked across the entire company. And as Ray mentioned, in some of the areas, the Marcellus, like the dry gas, that number is down on the low 20s. So while the strip price is going to move and fluctuate, to your point, we can work the throttle and work that to F&D cost as well. So that's a key variable for us. As for the 37% dry gas, I mean we've got some infrastructure coming on, on the dry gas gathering side that will allow us to ramp that of going forward. But again, it's sort of -- those are kind of game-time decisions as we look across the portfolio and Ray's team looks at having the optionality on 183 existing pads. Do I want to drill a super-rich? Do I want to drill wet? Or do I want to drill dry? We have other contracts besides MarkWest in Southwest PA. So a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables and it's just a matter of optimizing. But I think the key is having been -- discovered the play and having been there for 11 years, that first-mover advantage of having just a whole lot more optimality in how we move forward in a tough environment."

But specifically, for Range, if you look at Slide 15 in our presentation, it talks about our firm transportation takeaway in '16 and '17. And though it increases, it's part of the increase in our transportation and gathering when you look at the cycle margins. It increases the cost, but it -- also our basis differential improves both in 2016 midpoint of around $0.42.

Since our last call, we continue to make progress on several fronts. On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely peeking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway.

On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely peeking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway. At the same time, we are now loading propane on DLGCs and shipping it to various international markets. 
The ability to ship ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook is a significant competitive advantage for Range. As an E&P company, we're now able to connect a large percentage of our NGL production that end markets to buyers and consumers. As represented in our guidance for 2016, it has a meaningful impact on both NGL production and pricing. 
Given our transportation contracts for 2017, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving Range's expected natural gas differentials going forward. By the end of 2017, we expect to increase the amount of natural gas to be sold outside of the Appalachian Basin to about 82% of production. On the asset sales front, we recently closed the sale of our Bradford County acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania. The sale price was approximately $112 million. This was our only non-operated position in the Marcellus. We have also recently signed a purchase and sale agreement for our southern acreage package in the STACK play in Oklahoma. We have agreed to sell around 9,200 net acres and approximately 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production from approximately 200 wells in Blaine, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties for about $77 million. We expect to close by the end of May. The remaining northern acreage package is predominantly in major County Oklahoma consists of approximately 19,000 net acres and is on trend in North of the existing STACK play and is in the emerging Osage Play. Given that this play and another place are mulling in the direction of our position, we believe this acreage will increase in value with time in additional drilling results. Our plans will be to keep it for now since it's primarily HBP and we'll look at the possibility of selling it at a more opportune time in the future. 
Importantly, with these 2 asset sales of approximately $190 million, we expect no increase in actual debt from 2016 as compared to year-end 2015 based on current pricing. This type of neutral budget preserves our balance sheet and liquidity while allowing the macro environment time to improve. On the operations front, our team continues to optimize our development. We continue to improve both capital and operating efficiencies. Ray will discuss this and give some specific examples in his discussion. The Marcellus, specifically in Southwest Pennsylvania, will continue to be the focal point of our activity this year. 
As Ray will mentioned, we've drilled to outstanding new wells and the performance of some of the order wells continues to impress. Our third dry Utica well is performing better than the first 2 wells and appears to be one of the top wells in the entire Utica play. It's great to have 400,000 net acres of dry Utica potential beneath our Marcellus acreage, which gives us options down the road. The deciding factor for Range will ultimately be what are the economics of the Utica versus a Marcellus, we will allocate capital to wells were the best economics and right now, that means our Southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus development. 
In 2016, we're projecting lower well cost, the impact of improved price realizations, better transportation capabilities and lower all-in unit cost. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range and one of the reasons we're able to replace production so efficiently with maintenance CapEx of approximately $300 million or less. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play, combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. 
For 2015, our expected finding cost using current development cost to recover PUD reserves was $0.40 per Mcfe at year-end, significantly lower than the expectations of other natural gas producers. In the price environment, the industry is facing today, the ability to develop reserves more efficiently is the key advantage for Range. Utilizing a finding cost of $0.40 or better, coupled with our projected 2016 all-in cash cost and looking at 2017 strip prices, our projected unhedged recycle ratio approaches, too. As Ray mentioned on his last call, in our best areas, our projected unhedged recycle ratio is over 2. 
In summary, the first quarter was meaningful for Range. We had a significant marketing project become operational, we've got noncore asset sales at further high-grade our assets and keep debt unchanged at year-end and we continue to see improving well results across our acreage and Southwest Pennsylvania, all of which sets up Range well for 2016 and into 2017. I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

What I'll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward",2871,"Thanks, Jeff. What I'll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward. 
We continue to remain focused on capital allocation and our production growth is a result of high-quality properties being developed by a strong technical team. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.38 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and for the second quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.41 Bcf equivalent per day with 32% to 35% liquids. Of note, during the second quarter, we expect to fully replaced all of production sold from our 3 sales and our annual guidance moves to the high end of our previous guidance and is now expected to be 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. We believe this year will look very similar to previous years with sequential quarterly growth and our exit rate will be higher than it was at the end of 2015, setting us up well for 2017. 
For the first quarter, we continue to drive down our overall unit cost, resulting in a reduction of 10% from the prior year quarter. Basically, all of the categories bid guidance. 1 particular item that I would like to call your attention to is the LOE. Our operating teams continue to operate more efficiently. And when combined -- and when coupled with recent asset sales, our LOE for Mcfe is 37% lower than a year ago and 14% lower than the prior quarter. Capital efficiency continues to improve. I'll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,324 stages with 2.25 crews during the quarter, setting another record. Compared to the first quarter of 2015 with the same number of crews, this is a 28% improvement. March was a record month with 526 stages. We averaged 7.1 stages per day per crew, which is an improvement of 9% from a year ago and in spite of completing longer laterals, we completed 15% more wells in the quarter than a year ago. 
We've seen our water cost dramatically improve as a result of logistics, planning and some creative new management tools resulting in savings of over $350,000 per pad. These efficiency improvements resulted in a 31% reduction in total completion cost per foot of lateral compared to a year ago. On the drilling side for the first quarter, we achieved a 20% reduction in drilling cost per foot as compared to last year, while drilling 50% more lateral feet per day per well on average. Said another way, we drilled 50% faster and saved 20% on our drilling cost. All this helps us on 2 very significant fronts. First, we get better pricing from our service partners as they can count on very high utilization rates. While we don't make the terms of our service contracts public, what's important is that we believe that Range has the lowest cost per thousand foot of lateral in the basin. And secondly, we get our wells to sales faster, reducing the time from capital spend to sales. Therefore, improving our capital efficiency. Essentially, with the same number of crews, we completed 15% more wells in the first quarter than we did a year ago. 
I'll refer you back to Slide 8 in our updated presentation, illustrating the improvements in capital efficiency that we've achieved over the past several years. These examples that I've just covered should clearly illustrate well we expect to continue to improve into the future. And most importantly, we continue to work safely and environmentally responsibly. Our cost savings have not been at the expense of well performance. We continue to achieve outstanding well results. We recently bought online 5 wells on a new 7 well pad in our super-rich area. The wells had an average lateral length of 6,000 feet and were completed with an average of 31 stages. The wells were produced under facility constrained conditions and had an average of 24 hour initial rate to sales of over 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 65% liquids. 
Earlier in the quarter, we brought online a 3-well pad also in the super-rich area with average initial production to sales of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 63% liquids. It's early but clearly, these pads may significantly outperform the averages and they represent examples of areas where we can focus more capital in the future. 
In our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online 2 different pads worthy of mention. Together, these pads include 10 wells averaging 7,500-foot laterals completed with 39 stages. With 9 of those 10 wells online, again, under constrained conditions, the 9 wells achieved an average initial rate of sales of about 16 million a day per well. These 2 pads represent opportunities in our dry gas areas where we have fairly new and lower low-cost gathering systems with ample takeaway and many more multi-well pads and long lateral wells that we can develop going forward. 
On the last call, we discussed the flexibility of going back to existing Marcellus pads to drill additional wells. This morning, I'd like to get into more specifics on a few particular examples. The first example is the pad is described in our -- has been described in our presentation for sometime now and is currently on Page 39 of our updated presentation. About 2 years ago, we went back on to a 2-year-old Marcellus pad and drilled 2 new infill laterals between the existing laterals. In this particular example, because the pad, road, water infrastructure, production facilities and so forth were already in place, the wells where $850,000 less expensive per well on average than the original well, even though they were 50% longer laterals. 
The new wells were landed with improved targeting technology and completed with updated frac designs. And after 600 days, the new wells produced 53% more than the original wells. And importantly, the new wells which were spaced at 700 and 900 feet, respectively, did not impact the production of the original wells. 
A second example is in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back onto the existing 3-well pad and drilled 3 new laterals. You can see this example on Page 41. The original wells had an average lateral length of 4,800 feet completed with 25 stages and average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 22.6 million a day per well. The new wells were drilled about 1 year later, averaging almost 8,700-foot laterals completed with 45 stages and under facility constraints have an average initial 24-hour rate to sales of over 34 million a day per well. That's a 50% improvement in initial rates over the older wells. This is one of our very prolific areas that's performing well above our average type curve with many opportunities to drill additional wells on this pad and nearby pads. 
A third example is in our wet area of Southwest Pennsylvania, where we went back onto a 2-well existing pad and added 5 new wells with longer laterals, and again, newer completion technology. You can find this one on Page 40. The original wells were completed in 2010 and had an average lateral length of 3,700 feet completed with 13 stages. And the average initial 24-hour rate to sales was 6.7 million a day equivalent per well. 5 years later, in 2015, we completed 5 new wells, averaging 1,500-foot laterals, completed with 27 stages and these new wells had an average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions of 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well, which is over 300% improvement in initial rates. 
While we still have many new pads to develop, to restate what we said on the last call, we also have 124 pads with 5 or fewer wells in addition to 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells. This represents over 180 pads where we have the potential to go back and drill additional wells in any of our STACK to pay intervals whether its Marcellus, Upper Devonian or Utica. While all these pads represent unique and different opportunities, it's important to point out that we have the potential to drill wells with reduced capital as significant infrastructure is already in place, lower operating costs as we develop new efficiencies, less gathering and compression as limited incremental infrastructure is needed when you're on an existing pad, potentially improved performance as in the previous examples and very little to no impact on the existing production. All of these results in a step change improvement in capital efficiencies and an even lower F&D, like I discussed in the last call. 
Another added and significant benefit is the much shorter execution time. And we avoid the need for any additional surface disturbance. Again, it's very early in our planning cycle, but we could potentially drill about 50% of our wells next year on existing pads and we believe the savings per well could range from $200,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on each particular us situation. Some cases can be more. Again, we believe this is a unique advantage for Range. 
As you know, for years now, we've been showing type curves in our presentation on a normalized lateral length basis for the average of the actual wells that we bring to sales in a given year, all under the actual constrained conditions. We believe our average EURs per thousand foot are the best in the Southwest portion of the play, and that's among a strong performing group of our peers. We also believe our average cost per thousand foot are the lowest in the entire play. Again, these are the averages expected in a given year and we've always presented the prior year's production performance to support those type curves. 
What I'd like to do now is steer away from the averages for a moment and point out a couple of specific areas. Let me begin with an area in the dry gas portion of Washington County. This example consists of 22 wells from 4 separate well pads in which we're projecting the average recovery is 3.1 Bcf per thousand foot. These wells have an average lateral length of 6,300 feet and the EUR is 21% better than our average dry gas area type curve. These wells have a minimum of 180 days and as much as 2 years of production history. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million using a flat $3 NYMEX price, the internal rate of return is 61%.  We're planning on turning to sales this year an additional 23 wells from 5 pads in this area with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet. 
Referring to the previous example I described in the wet gas area, we turned to sales 5 wells, again, which is illustrated on Page 40, where we drilled on an existing pad. The new wells have a projected EUR of 3.6 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot of lateral. This is 22% higher than our average EUR for the wet area type curve. These wells have been online for 11 months. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, the return on these wells using a flat $3 NYMEX price is 34%. We're planning on turning to sales over the next 12 months an additional 9 wells from 2 pads in this area with an average lateral length of over 5,800 feet. 
We expect to continue with longer laterals going forward. In 2014, our average lateral length drilled was 4,915 feet. In 2015, it was about 6,300 feet. And this year, we expect the average about 7,100 feet. While it's through early in our planning cycle for 2017, we expect to drill wells that average around 8,000 feet of lateral length. Ultimately, we expect that we'll be drilling 10,000 foot laterals on average in the dry area and probably slightly less than that in the liquids areas. Just as a point out, wer planning to turn to sales 2 wells later this year in the range of 9,500-foot laterals and we'll also filled 3 laterals over 13,000 feet this year with the longest planned for 16,220 feet of lateral length. Importantly, our HB efforts are largely behind us after this year. Our land budget in 2014 was over $200 million. In 2015, we spent approximately $70 million. And this year, our land budget is reduced to approximately $20 million. Our development plan has positioned us to increase our flexibility going forward by allowing us to focus our capital on the very best return projects. 
While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to remember are: We have a large core position, low cost structure, strong capital efficiency, drilling longer laterals, an attractive transportation portfolio, ability to drill over 180 existing pads as well as new pads, ability to focus in our best and most prolific areas, ability to increase liquids production when economically warranted, a low decline based production, very low maintenance CapEx and, finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. 
To answer the common question about maintenance CapEx, if you consider what I've discussed here this morning regarding our ability to drill on existing pads along with targeting some of our better areas and couple that with our low base decline rate of approximately 19%, we have the ability to hold our 2017 production flat to this year's expected exit rate for $300 million or less. We believe this low level of maintenance CapEx makes our production incredibly resilient if prices were to stay low while providing us a solid base to grow from when the supply and demand equation improves and prices move higher. The point is that whatever prices do and wherever we set the trailing throttle, having a really low maintenance CapEx works in our favor. 
Shifting to marketing. Utilizing our Mariner East Transportation Range loaded the very first VLTC from the East Coast with 550,000 barrels of propane on March 19. Range also saw the first INEOS ethane ship set sail from the East Coast during the first quarter. Both ethane and propane ships are now leaving Marcus Hook on a regular basis and having international exposure for our products is expected to benefit our netback pricing going forward. 
Looking ahead, our next transportation option coming into service is that Texas Eastern Gulf Market's expansion project, expected to start later this year. This project will allow us to ship more production to the Gulf Coast region, anticipating a positive impact to our sales portfolio. By the end of this year, we'll have about 70% of our gas sold outside the basin and like Jeff said earlier, by late '17, we'll have over 80% over a gas sold outside the basin which we expect to result in better netback pricing. 
As a further update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H is currently shut-in for facilities buildout and an extended bottom hole pressure buildup. We expect to bring the well to sales in about 60 days. But just over 30-day flow back test initiated immediately after completion, again, with no agent, averaged 18.3 million a day to sales with the gas rate essentially held flat with high flying pressures. You can see how these well's performance compares to some of the nearby and noteworthy Utica wells drilled by our peers on Page 35 in our updated presentation. Early data indicates that this well could be one of the top wells to date in the play. Our current expectations are that the well will be put to sales at approximately 12 million a day. The first phase of the reservoir modeling suggest it should hope that rate flat for approximately 500 days before declining. We'll know a lot more in a few months once we complete the next phase of our data acquisition and modeling and the well is actually put to sales, but again, early indications are good. 
As most of you know, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently far exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development. And over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor our 3 wells along with the offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. 
In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our core assets, we remain well positioned to create value. Over to Roger."

There are many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continue to effectively position the company for the current economic environment. In the future, with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing. 
Starting with the balance sheet this time. We ended the quarter with less debt than we entered and our capital spending plans are right on track to produce prudent growth and production and reserves with improving capital efficiency. A major highlight of the quarter was the unanimous reaffirmation of our annually determined $3 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. Beyond the committed liquidity it provides, looking behind the numbers at the approval process, reveals 3 significant positive breakthroughs. First, the reaffirmation excluded the collateral value associated with the December 2015 Nora sale and the 2 more recent asset sales, which in aggregate exceeded $1 billion in sales proceeds
[Audio Gap]
The strength of our banking relationships and the unique portfolio of value-added marketing arrangements we have for our natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which will improve future pricing. Our recycle ratio, based on our year-end 2015 reserve report F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure, projected 2016 basis to NYMEX and current unhedged strip price for 2017 is approaching 2x, ensuring that we can continue to grow our reserves and production within our unhedged future cash flow. 
As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe an underappreciated element, the balance sheet strength and preservation is having an unhedged recycle ratio above 1x, which allows for both growth and debt reduction at the same time over time. Our first quarter ending debt-to-EBITDAX ratio for the past 3 years has been 3x, 2.8x and 2.9x, respectively. The ratio at the end of this year's first quarter is a very manageable 3.3x. As a reminder, Range has no debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, no bond maturities until 2021, $1.3 billion in freshly committed liquidity, low maintenance capital requirements, click control of our capital spending level and timing and a robust recycle ratio well over 1x. 
With prices improving, our recycle ratio will also continue to improve and the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will eventually [indiscernible] with no negative impact to our operations. 
Turning to the income statement, comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of last year, the impact of 45% lower realized prices could not be offset through production growth and cost reductions. First quarter net loss was $92 million, largely prompted by a $43 million pretax impairment of certain Oklahoma properties. First quarter earnings based on analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries was a loss of $17 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share. On the cost side of the ledger, cash unit cost were down $0.01 from last year and total unit cost of including the DNA was down $0.29 from last year. All cost categories came in below guidance with direct cash operating cost at $0.19 per Mcfe, breaking the $0.20 level for the first time. 
The main reason for the operating cost beat was the absence of a severe winter and the avoided cost of tending to our wells with added shifts during periods of extreme cold. Transportation, gathering and compression were also well below guidance at $1 per Mcfe. This positive variance to guidance may be attributed to lower cost associated with our production mix and also lower transportation cost that were avoided due to the delayed full system startup of the Mariner East project. 
Second quarter expense guidance may be found in the earnings release and other useful costs and hedging data, as Laith mentioned, may be found as of movable tables posted to the Range website. Cash flow for the first quarter was $99 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.59. First quarter EBITDAX was $135 million. Range remains well hedged in 2016, with more than 80% of our 2016 gas production carrying a floor of 322 MMBTU. As 2017 and 2018 NYMEX gas prices have improved and because our full cycle cost structure is so lower, we have commenced limited natural gas hedging in these years to reduce down side price risk and ensure cash flow is available for growth. 
We've also added our NGL hedge position during the quarter, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q, earnings release and on the website. 
To summarize the first quarter, we've continued to successfully shed noncore assets, decrease debt, reduce our cost structure and improve our capital efficiency while delivering consistent growth. Looking ahead, we see continued disciplined growth with even better capital efficiency, plus improved pricing from our new ethane, propane and condensate marketing arrangements. As Ray described in his remarks, this really sets us up well for '17 and beyond. 
Jeff, I'll turn it back to you."

We're in the highest quality gas play with economics I think it really rival any play. STACK pay area, by the end of this year, it's predominately HBP, so we've got a lot of optionality, not only in drilling Marcellus, Utica or Upper Devonian, but drilling wet or dry. We've got really low maintenance CapEx, which I think is important and I think is if it is in best-in-class, it's clearly right up there coupled with really good marketing agreements. Now that our newest pieces in place, Mariner East. So the ability to move ethane, propane or natural gas really to multiple markets around the U.S. or even internationally, ability to go back on existing pads, those are all key things. So I think what you'll see us do is bring great shape in a low-price environment. We believe that a lot of good fundamentals are setting up for natural gas to improve, rolling -- we think this will be the first year natural gas supply roll since 2005 our something back like that. And coupled with a time where demands come up. So when a lower for longer scenario, we're well-positioned. In a higher price scenario, we have a lot of optionality. Ray's talked about it and continue to talk about, I think, when you looked at our frac-ing efficiency, it's probably best-in-class or right up there number of -- our drilling efficiency on wells. So we have the ability to ramp we need be. But we're going to be very returns focused, we'll be sensitive to balance sheet and those types of things. So we have a lot of optionality to push at the lever or the throttle forward or to put back which is, I think the position that we want to be in. So that's kind of a long-winded answer, but I think philosophically, we'll think about the returns we're getting, we'll think about the balance sheet and all those types of things. But we have a lot of optionality without we have. Team continues to be better and better as evidenced by the capital efficiency and we try to slice and dice that in multiple ways everything from high-level graph that shows our capital efficiency to some of the specifics. And again, feel free to ask Ray about some of those I think when you look at them versus peers, the impressive numbers. So that's kind of philosophically how we look at it."

We market the data in 2 pieces. The southern package was actually in the STACK play. It was about roughly 9,000 acres of scattered across 3 counties, kind of small broken up pieces within the play, collectively producing about 5 million per day equivalent net from 200 wells, 200 all legacy vertical wells. You can do the math there. So the price we get for that, we can do a very strong price for that kind of position, particularly in today's market. When you look at the northern piece, which is bigger and about 19,000 net acres, it's mainly in Major County, predominantly in Major County, which is north of the STACK play but the play is clearly moving in that direction and there's rigs coming right up to us. And it's also in the emerging Osage Play and there's other plays. We actually have 8 rigs drilling in and around us. It's all HBP. So our thoughts are to just wait, watch some of the drilling results that we expect will be good and just sell into a a better price. So we have because, it's HBP, we have the optionality uptime. So I think you'll see a cell that in marketed in due time, this lower productivity, but I think a map of our acreage was up on our website at one time or the IR team will give it to you. And so you can look at the active rigs, I'm sure if you subscribe to the services, there's a lot of activity around us. Remaining stuff we have in the Panhandle and up in the Northern Oklahoma. I think, you'll just see us sell us with time, but will do it at an opportune time. It's similar to the Nora sale. But it just, Nora, we had to find the right buyer of the right time. And we were very pleased with the sale, hopefully it's a win-win for both sides. But it's finding that buyer that really likes the asset. Bradford County was the same thing. People that follow us we have that for sale for a long time. We were very disciplined and we finally failed the buyer the what we thought was the price. I think if you look at those old cases, the price we got was about double what most of the people thought Nora or Bradford County was worth. So I think the remaining stuff in Oklahoma, particularly the northern part of the acreage in Major County is just picking the right time in the right buyer. But you'll see us sell that with time."

And you look at that over the years and you've seen really good improvements and even across years, we're service cost are actually going up, we were making significant improvements. A lot of that is driven by drilling longer laterals, it's just the fact that our teams and our service crews are getting more and more experienced. And all those things factoring in are allowing us to keep doing what we're doing. And I think that we're going to see probably half of our wells, could be less, could be more. I mean, we're really, really early in the planning cycle at this point. But some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks and when you couple the savings of the fact that you don't have to build pads and roads and production facilities, other things that we don't talk a lot about or like things like survey, land, title, curative, got water infrastructure and depending on where that pad is in relation to the current water infrastructure we have in place. And all of those things, you could save a couple of hundred thousand a well. You can save up to $850,000 a well, depending on the particular situation. And I think those kinds of savings are real. I think it's taken us lots of years to develop a very large core asset area. We've got a great low base decline rate, which allows us to build very efficiently with the capital that we allocate. We've got some, clearly, some really high prolific performing areas like I went through in my remarks. A couple of those example of that we can focus on. We've got new infrastructure that always continually still being built like some of the new dry gas stuff I talked about in my remarks. So I think it's just all when you roll up together, the fact that we've got a great transportation portfolio, we've got diverse outlets for operational aspects and as far as pricing aspects. A lot of these things have taken years to develop. All of our HBP concerns are covered this year. And so we've got a great future going forward. And I think we can just continue that capital efficiency, the service contractors can continue to operate, give us with pricing because of the high utilization rates. We don't think anyone else in the basin is operating at the number of fracs per day that we are anywhere close. So I think there's a lot of things out there like that that just gives us a pretty unique advantage when you compare us to all our peers."

I think the gas placemats, we've had for a long time internally and then of course, we've made it public, I guess 2 or 3 years back. And they're actually holding very true. I think as we've seen future -- more and more development occur in the Utica and the Upper Devonian and a portion of the Marcellus, I think they've held really true. I think it's going to be like most plays historically have been aware that true core sweet spots tend to shrink and so forth. And I think that's big reason behind or low base decline rate. I think we have better hydrocarbons, better hydrocarbon content, I should say, better perm, better prosody, better pressures. And so we get better desorption of gas in the long run. And a lot of those things help us. But I think they're going to hold pretty true. Clearly, the Utica is really early, especially on the Pennsylvania side. But we're pretty pleased about that. 
Going forward on the Utica, we think when we get ready to do the next well and we're not sure when the exactly that's going to be yet, but we can do based on what we know today, 6,500 foot lateral for around $12 million, probably less now. An 8,000-foot lateral or so, we can probably do for about $14 million or less. We think that's probably an industry-leading cost already. We're a little bit shallower than some of the other wells, so there's a little bit less cost there. We, in our last well completed, I think it was 5,800 feet with 38 stages, and we were 500,000 pounds per stage and it was 50-50 100 mesh and 40-70 premium white sand. So we don't think ceramics is going to be necessary at least in our acreage. That's going to keep costly down. Of course, every well that you get under your belt, you learn a lot more. So a little bit less science is required. We will continue to drill these wells on existing Marcellus pads. So you've got a lot of savings there like we've talked about previously. And I think all of those things set us up well. We're pretty convinced that 40,000 acres is going to be really high-quality stuff. But at this point in time, as good as we can do, it's still 2.5x more expensive than a dry gas Marcellus well in the Eastern part of Washington County. And when you look at that, some of these Marcellus wells that I've talked about in my prepared remarks, we're making about the same volume, if not more in a years' time. And we can get it for 2.5x less dollars. So that's what we're focused or capital, especially in this market. But we believe the Utica and be a big deal going forward? Yes. Do we believe it can be influential, yes? Do we believe it's going to be competitive? No. We think it's going to be complementary. Because it's something that stacked with our Marcellus stuff. So I think that's where we see that going forward. But we're very encouraged, and again, I'll refer you to Page 35. I think it is in our presentation and look at how it performs versus some of our offset peers' wells that have been real noteworthy and they're all great wells. No doubt about it. But I think what we're seeing is our acreage can be right up there among the best acreage that there is in the play."

And again, the savings, the 200 to 500, let's say, or 600, whatever it might be in a particular case, that's going to be that dirtwork things like the building the pad and the road. And then you get that for production facilities which, as you know, the separators, the production tanks, the heater traders, all those different things. They're going to be different in super-rich versus the wet, versus the dry area. They're all different. And I think people tend to group this together and say it's going to be the same all the way across. And they forget that, #1, we had a really large position. And #2, it's really there for us. And so we've got lots of different designs of facilities that we deal with. But it's going to be all of meter taps and things like that. And then you've got things like damages that you play the land owners, survey costs, title curative, you got a lot of different things like that we don't talk a whole lot about, which are really significant. You've got water infrastructure, if it's a pad that's right near an impoundment or right on a pipeline network. Of course, the water cost could vary by several hundred thousand dollars on a pad. And some of the new things that we're doing lately today, we're saving on average probably $300,000, maybe $350,000 per pad in water cost, which is that significant when you're drilling a new full well pad is really significant. If you just go back and add 1 or 2 wells on a pad. So I think those things are all the capital costs that role in there. If you think about going back onto an existing pad and there's room in the gathering system which is why we would go back onto an existing pad, you don't have to add any more compression or low-pressure pipe. And when you do that, those are -- that's a significant part of the cost in our gathering, compression and transportation line, which is, I think, was $0.99 or whatever it was for the first quarter. Significant piece of that is that low-pressure gathering and compression charge. When you go back with an existing well, you could see those numbers be a lot less. And not because they're all different. But it could be most of that cost goes away, essentially. You're really only looking at a variable cost of fuel and the fuel things like that new production online and to the existing system. So there are a lot of things like that, that help us. And then it's just as far as LOEs and things, the way it helps you there is basically, you're not adding new equipment and new infrastructure that you have to add new lease operators for to cover. In other words, going back onto an existing pad, those would cost us to add more personnel, doesn't cause us to really add a lot more chemicals or maintenance or anything else like that. It's kind of stuff that's already there and being operated. So I don't know, it's a long-winded roundabout way to kind of talk about some of those things. But all that helps us reach the capital efficiencies that we're with. And again, this has been a process that we actually talked about in the very early days, way back 2007 and 2008 when we started drilling and building some of these pads. And it's been a goal all along to build these pads or we can go back and drill as many as we can content, 15, 18 wells in some cases. And we were always really focused on the fact of having diverse outlets, diverse pricing scenarios for our products and not being dependent upon any one situation or project. All of those things have really helped us. And this year's been a really a turning point-year for us because some of the big projects like Mariner East coming online. Spectre's Uniontown to Gas City was a pipeline project that we worked on for years, we get the Gulf coast project coming online. All of these things have taken years to put in place. And I think that's a very unique part of our story going forward."

When you look at that, the economics on that stuff is, even if you build a new pad, is probably better than going back on some of the existing pads in today's world in the wet and super-rich area. So we've got that flexibility to go both ways. And it really comes down to what gets us the best overall project return for our capital in a year's time. Where are we going to be able to put a dollar in, where are we going to get the most dollars out. And it's really that simple.

On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely peeking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway. At the same time, we are now loading propane on VLGCs and shipping it to various international markets. 
The ability to ship ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook is a significant competitive advantage for Range. As an E&P company, we're now able to connect a large percentage of our NGL production to end markets, the buyers and consumers. As represented in our guidance for 2016, it has a meaningful impact on both NGL production and pricing. 
Given our transportation contracts for 2017, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving Range's expected natural gas differentials going forward. By the end of 2017, we expect to increase the amount of natural gas to be sold outside of the Appalachian Basin to about 82% of production. On the asset sales front, we recently closed the sale of our Bradford County acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania. The sale price was approximately $112 million. This was our only non-operated position in the Marcellus. 
We have also recently signed a purchase and sale agreement for our southern acreage package in the STACK play in Oklahoma. We have agreed to sell around 9,200 net acres and approximately 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production from approximately 200 wells in Blaine, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties for about $77 million. We expect to close by the end of May. The remaining northern acreage packages, predominantly in Major County, Oklahoma, consist of approximately 19,000 net acres and is on trend in North of the existing STACK play and is in the emerging Osage play. Given that this play and other plays are moving in the direction of our position, we believe this acreage will increase in value with time in additional drilling results. Our plans will be to keep it for now since it's primarily HBP, and we'll look at the possibility of selling it at a more opportune time in the future. 
Importantly, with these 2 asset sales of approximately $190 million, we expect no increase in absolute debt in 2016 as compared to year-end 2015 based on current pricing. This type of neutral budget preserves our balance sheet and liquidity while allowing the macro environment time to improve. 
On the operations front, our team continues to optimize our development. We continue to improve both capital and operating efficiencies. Ray will discuss this and give some specific examples in his discussion. The Marcellus, specifically in Southwest Pennsylvania, will continue to be the focal point of our activity this year. As Ray will mention, we drilled some outstanding new wells and the performance of some of the older wells continues to impress. 
Our third dry Utica well is performing better than the first 2 wells and appears to be one of the top wells in the entire Utica play. It's great to have 400,000 net acres of dry Utica potential beneath our Marcellus acreage, which gives us options down the road. The deciding factor for Range will ultimately be what are the economics of the Utica versus a Marcellus, will we allocate -- we will allocate capital to the wells with the best economics, and right now, that means our Southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus development. 
In 2016, we're projecting lower well cost, the impact of improved price realizations, better transportation capabilities and lower all-in unit cost. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range and one of the reasons we're able to replace production so efficiently with maintenance CapEx of approximately $300 million or less. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play, combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. 
For 2015, our expected finding cost using current development cost to recover PUD reserves was $0.40 per Mcfe at year-end, significantly lower than the expectations of other natural gas producers. In the price environment the industry is facing today, the ability to develop reserves more efficiently is the key advantage for Range. Utilizing a finding cost of $0.40 or better, coupled with our projected 2016 all-in cash cost and looking at 2017 strip prices, our projected unhedged recycle ratio approaches 2. As Ray mentioned on his last call, in our best areas, our projected unhedged recycle ratio is over 2. 
In summary, the first quarter was meaningful for Range. We had a significant marketing project become operational, we've got noncore asset sales that further high-grade our assets and keep debt unchanged at year-end and we continue to see improving well results across our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, all of which sets up well -- sets up Range well for 2016 and into 2017. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

What I'll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward",2871,"Thanks, Jeff. What I'll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward. 
We continue to remain focused on capital allocation, and our production growth is a result of high-quality properties being developed by a strong technical team. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.38 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and for the second quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.41 Bcf equivalent per day with 32% to 35% liquids. Of note, during the second quarter, we expect to fully replace all the production sold from our 3 sales and our annual guidance moves to the high end of our previous guidance and is now expected to be 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. We believe this year will look very similar to previous years with sequential quarterly growth, and our exit rate will be higher than it was at the end of 2015, setting us up well for 2017. 
For the first quarter, we continue to drive down our overall unit cost, resulting in a reduction of 10% from the prior year quarter. Basically, all of the categories beat guidance. 1 particular item that I would like to call your attention to is the LOE. Our operating teams continue to operate more efficiently. And when combined -- and when coupled with recent asset sales, our LOE per Mcfe is 37% lower than a year ago and 14% lower than the prior quarter. 
Capital efficiency continues to improve. I'll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,324 stages with 2.25 crews during the quarter, setting another record. Compared to the first quarter of 2015 with the same number of crews, this is a 28% improvement. March was a record month with 526 stages. We averaged 7.1 stages per day per crew, which is an improvement of 9% from a year ago. And in spite of completing longer laterals, we completed 15% more wells in the quarter than a year ago. 
We've seen our water cost dramatically improve as a result of logistics, planning and some creative new management tools, resulting in savings of over $350,000 per pad. These efficiency improvements resulted in a 31% reduction in total completion cost per foot of lateral compared to a year ago. On the drilling side for the first quarter, we achieved a 20% reduction in drilling cost per foot as compared to last year while drilling 50% more lateral feet per day per well on average. Said another way, we drilled 50% faster and saved 20% on our drilling cost. 
All this helps us on 2 very significant fronts. First, we get better pricing from our service partners as they can count on very high utilization rates. While we don't make the terms of our service contracts public, what's important is that we believe that Range has the lowest cost per thousand foot of lateral in the basin. And secondly, we get our wells to sales faster, reducing the time from capital spend to sales. Therefore, improving our capital efficiency. Essentially, with the same number of crews, we completed 15% more wells in the first quarter than we did a year ago. 
I'll refer you back to Slide 8 in our updated presentation, illustrating the improvements in capital efficiency that we've achieved over the past several years. These examples that I've just covered should clearly illustrate why we expect to continue to improve into the future. And most importantly, we continue to work safely and environmentally responsibly. 
Our cost savings have not been at the expense of well performance. We continue to achieve outstanding well results. We recently brought online 5 wells on a new 7 well pad in our super-rich area. The wells had an average lateral length of 6,000 feet and were completed with an average of 31 stages. The wells were produced under facility constrained conditions and had an average 24-hour initial rate to sales of over 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 65% liquids. 
Earlier in the quarter, we brought online a 3-well pad also in the super-rich area, with average initial production to sales of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 63% liquids. It's early but clearly, these pads may significantly outperform the averages, and they represent examples of areas where we can focus more capital in the future. 
In our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online 2 different pads worthy of mention. Together, these pads include 10 wells averaging 7,500-foot laterals completed with 39 stages. With 9 of those 10 wells online, again, under constrained conditions, the 9 wells achieved an average initial rate of sales of about 16 million a day per well. These 2 pads represent opportunities in our dry gas areas where we have fairly new and low-cost gathering systems with ample takeaway and many more multi-well pads and long lateral wells that we can develop going forward. 
On the last call, we discussed the flexibility of going back to existing Marcellus pads to drill additional wells. This morning, I'd like to get into more specifics on a few particular examples. The first example is the pad that's described in our -- that has been described in our presentation for sometime now and is currently on Page 39 of our updated presentation. About 2 years ago, we went back onto a 2-year-old Marcellus pad and drilled 2 new infill laterals between the existing laterals. In this particular example, because the pad, road, water infrastructure, production facilities and so forth were already in place, the wells were $850,000 less expensive per well on average than the original well, even though they were 50% longer laterals. 
The new wells were landed with improved targeting technology and completed with updated frac designs. And after 600 days, the new wells produced 53% more than the original wells. And importantly, the new wells which were spaced at 700 and 900 feet, respectively, did not impact the production of the original wells. 
A second example is in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back onto an existing 3-well pad and drilled 3 new laterals. You can see this example on Page 41. The original wells had an average lateral length of 4,800 feet completed with 25 stages and the average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions, was 22.6 million a day per well. The new wells were drilled about 1 year later, averaging almost 8,700-foot laterals completed with 45 stages and under facility constraints, have an average initial 24-hour rate to sales of over 34 million a day per well. That's a 50% improvement in initial rates from the -- over the older wells. This is one of our very prolific areas that's performing well above our average type curve, with many opportunities to drill additional wells on this pad and nearby pads. 
A third example is in our wet area of Southwest Pennsylvania, where we went back onto a 2-well existing pad and added 5 new wells with longer laterals and, again, newer completion technology. You can find this one on Page 40. The original wells were completed in 2010 and had an average lateral length of 3,700 feet completed with 13 stages. And the average initial 24-hour rate to sales was 6.7 million a day equivalent per well. 5 years later, in 2015, we completed 5 new wells, averaging 1,500-foot laterals, completed with 27 stages, and these new wells had an average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions of 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well, which is over 300% improvement in initial rates. 
While we still have many new pads to develop, to restate what we said on the last call, we also have 124 pads with 5 or fewer wells in addition to 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells. This represents over 180 pads where we have the potential to go back and drill additional wells in any of our stacked pay intervals, whether its Marcellus, Upper Devonian or Utica. 
While all these pads represent unique and different opportunities, it's important to point out that we have the potential to drill wells with reduced capital as significant infrastructure is already in place, lower operating costs as we develop new efficiencies, less gathering and compression as limited incremental infrastructure is needed when you're on an existing pad, potentially improved performances in the previous examples and very little to no impact on the existing production. All of these results in a step change improvement in capital efficiencies and an even lower F&D, like I discussed on the last call. 
Another added and significant benefit is the much shorter execution time. And we avoid the need for any additional surface disturbance. Again, it's very early in our planning cycle, but we could potentially drill about 50% of our wells next year on existing pads, and we believe the savings per well could range from $200,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on each particular situation. Some cases could be more. Again, we believe this is a unique advantage for Range. 
As you know for years now, we've been showing type curves in our presentation on a normalized lateral length basis for the average of the actual wells that we bring to sales in a given year, all under the actual constrained conditions. We believe our average EURs per thousand foot are the best in the Southwest portion of the play, and that's among a strong performing group of our peers. We also believe our average cost per thousand foot are the lowest in the entire play. Again, these are the averages expected in a given year and we've always presented the prior year's production performance to support those type curves. 
What I'd like to do now is steer away from the averages for a moment and point out a couple of specific areas. Let me begin with an area in the dry gas portion of Washington County. This example consists of 22 wells from 4 separate well pads, in which we are projecting the average recovery is 3.1 Bcf per thousand foot. These wells have an average lateral length of 6,300 feet and the EUR is 21% better than our average dry gas area type curve. These wells have a minimum of 180 days and as much as 2 years of production history. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million using a flat $3 NYMEX price, the internal rate of return is 61%.  We're planning on turning to sales this year an additional 23 wells from 5 pads in this area, with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet. 
Referring to the previous example I described in the wet  gas area, we turned to sales 5 wells again, which is illustrated on Page 40, where we drilled on an existing pad. The new wells have a projected EUR of 3.6 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot of lateral. This is 22% higher than our average EUR for the wet area type curve. These wells have been online for 11 months. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, the return on these wells using a flat $3 NYMEX price is 34%. We're planning on turning to sales over the next 12 months an additional 9 wells from 2 pads in this area, with an average lateral length of over 5,800 feet. 
We expect to continue with longer laterals going forward. In 2014, our average lateral length drilled was 4,915 feet. In 2015, it was about 6,300 feet. And this year, we expect the average to be about 7,100 feet. While it's still early in our planning cycle for 2017, we expect to drill wells that average around 8,000 feet of lateral length. Ultimately, we expect that we'll be drilling 10,000-foot laterals on average in the dry area and probably slightly less than that in the liquids areas. Just as a point out, we're planning to turn to sales 2 wells later this year in the range of 9,500-foot laterals, and we'll also drill 3 laterals over 13,000 feet this year with the longest planned for 16,220 feet of lateral length. 
Importantly, our HB efforts are largely behind us after this year. Our land budget in 2014 was over $200 million. In 2015, we spent approximately $70 million. And this year, our land budget is reduced to approximately $20 million. Our development plan has positioned us to increase our flexibility going forward by allowing us to focus our capital on the very best return projects. 
While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to remember are: we have a large core position, low cost structure, strong capital efficiency, drilling longer laterals, an attractive transportation portfolio, ability to drill on over 180 existing pads as well as new pads, ability to focus in our best and most prolific areas, ability to increase liquids production when economically warranted, a low decline base production, very low maintenance CapEx and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. 
To answer the common question about maintenance CapEx, if you consider what I've discussed here this morning regarding our ability to drill on existing pads, along with targeting some of our better areas, and couple that with our low base decline rate of approximately 19%, we have the ability to hold our 2017 production flat to this year's expected exit rate for $300 million or less. We believe this low level of maintenance CapEx makes our production incredibly resilient if prices were to stay low while providing us a solid base to grow from when the supply and demand equation improves and prices move higher. The point is that whatever prices do and wherever we set the trailing throttle, having a really low maintenance CapEx works in our favor. 
Shifting to marketing. Utilizing our Mariner East transportation, Range loaded the very first VLGC from the East Coast with 550,000 barrels of propane on March 19. Range also saw the first INEOS ethane ship set sail from the East Coast during the first quarter. Both ethane and propane ships are now leaving Marcus Hook on a regular basis, and having international exposure for our products is expected to benefit our netback pricing going forward. 
Looking ahead, our next transportation option coming into service is the Texas Eastern Gulf Market's expansion project, expected to start later this year. This project will allow us to ship more production to the Gulf Coast region, anticipating a positive impact to our sales portfolio. By the end of this year, we'll have about 70% of our gas sold outside the basin. And like Jeff said earlier, by late '17, we'll have over 80% of our gas sold outside the basin, which we expect to result in better netback pricing. 
As a further update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H is currently shut-in for facilities buildout and an extended bottom hole pressure buildup. We expect to bring the well to sales in about 60 days. But just over 30-day flow back test initiated immediately after completion, again, with no aging, averaged 18.3 million a day to sales, with the gas rate essentially held flat with high flying pressures. You can see how this well's performance compares to some of the nearby and noteworthy Utica wells drilled by our peers on Page 35 in our updated presentation. Early data indicates that this well could be one of the top wells to date in the play. Our current expectations are that the well will be put to sales at approximately 12 million a day. The first phase of the reservoir modeling suggest it should hold that rate flat for approximately 500 days before declining. We'll know a lot more in a few months once we complete the next phase of our data acquisition and modeling and the well is actually put to sales, but again, early indications are good. 
As most of you know, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently far exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development. And over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor our 3 wells along with the offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. 
In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our core assets, we remain well positioned to create value. 
Over to Roger."

There are many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continue to effectively position the company for the current economic environment and the future, with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing. 
Starting with the balance sheet this time. We ended the quarter with less debt than we entered and our capital spending plans are right on track to produce prudent growth and production and reserves with improving capital efficiency. A major highlight of the quarter was the unanimous reaffirmation of our annually determined $3 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. Beyond the committed liquidity it provides, looking behind the numbers at the approval process, reveals 3 significant positive read-throughs. First, the reaffirmation excluded the collateral value associated with the December 2015 Nora sale and the 2 more recent asset sales, which in aggregate exceeded $1 billion in sales proceeds.
[Audio Gap]
The strength of our banking relationships and the unique portfolio of value-added marketing arrangements we have for our natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which will improve future pricing. Our recycle ratio, based on our year-end 2015 reserve report F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure, projected 2016 basis to NYMEX and current unhedged strip price for 2017, is approaching 2x, ensuring that we can continue to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. 
As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe an underappreciated element, the balance sheet strength and preservation, is having an unhedged recycle ratio above 1x, which allows for both growth and debt reduction at the same time, over time. Our first quarter ending debt-to-EBITDAX ratio for the past 3 years has been 3x, 2.8x and 2.9x, respectively. The ratio at the end of this year's first quarter is a very manageable 3.3x. As a reminder, Range has no debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, no bond maturities until 2021, $1.3 billion in freshly committed liquidity, low maintenance capital requirements, fleet control over our capital spending level and timing and a robust recycle ratio well over 1x. With prices improving, our recycle ratio will also continue to improve and the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will eventually crest over or decline with no negative impact to our operations. 
Turning to the income statement, comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of last year, the impact of 45% lower realized prices could not be offset through production growth and cost reductions. First quarter net loss was $92 million, largely prompted by a $43 million pretax impairment of certain Oklahoma properties. First quarter earnings based on analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries, was a loss of $17 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share. 
On the cost side of the ledger, cash unit costs were down $0.01 from last year, and total unit cost, including the DD&A, was down $0.29 from last year. All cost categories came in below guidance, with direct cash operating cost at $0.19 per Mcfe, breaking the $0.20 level for the first time. The main reason for the large operating cost beat was the absence of a severe winter and the avoided cost of tending to our wells with added shifts during periods of extreme cold. Transportation, gathering and compression were also well below guidance at $1 per Mcfe. This positive variance to guidance may be attributed to lower cost associated with our production mix and also lower transportation cost that were avoided due to the delayed full system startup of the Mariner East project. 
Second quarter expense guidance may be found in the earnings release, and other useful costs and hedging data, as Laith mentioned, may be found in the supplemental tables posted to the Range website. 
Cash flow for the first quarter was $99 million, and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.59. First quarter EBITDAX was $135 million. Range remains well hedged in 2016, with more than 80% of our 2016 gas production carrying a floor of 322 MMBTU. As 2017 and 2018 NYMEX gas prices have improved and because our full cycle cost structure is so low, we have commenced limited natural gas hedging in these years to reduce downside price risk and ensure cash flow is available for growth. We've also added to our NGL hedge position during the quarter, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q, earnings release and on the website. 
To summarize the first quarter, we've continued to successfully shed noncore assets, decrease debt, reduce our cost structure and improve our capital efficiency while delivering consistent growth. Looking ahead, we see continued disciplined growth with even better capital efficiency, plus improved pricing from our new ethane, propane and condensate marketing arrangements. As Ray described in his remarks, this sets us -- really sets us up well for '17 and beyond. 
Jeff, I'll turn it back to you."

I think, let me talk about it in a very conceptual way and start with, again, I think we're in a great position. We're in the highest quality gas play that's there with economics, I think it really rival any play. It's a stacked pay area. By the end of this year, it's predominately HBP, so we've got a lot of optionality, not only in drilling Marcellus, Utica or Upper Devonian, but drilling wet or dry. We've got really low maintenance CapEx, which I think is important and I think is -- if it isn't best-in-class, it's clearly right up there, coupled with really good marketing agreements. Now there's a lot -- our newest pieces in place, Mariner East, so the ability to move ethane, propane or natural gas, really, to multiple markets around the U.S. or even internationally, the ability to go back on existing pads, those are all key things. So I think what you'll see us do is we're in great shape in a low-price environment. We believe that a lot of good fundamentals are setting up for natural gas to improve, rolling -- we think this will be the first year natural gas supply roll since 2005 or something back like that, and coupled with a time where demand is coming up. So in a lower -- or longer scenario, we're well-positioned. In a higher-price scenario, we have a lot of optionality. Ray's talked about it and can continue to talk about. I think when you look at our fracking efficiency, it's probably best-in-class or right up there, number of -- our drilling efficiency on wells. So we have the ability to ramp when need be. But we're going to be very returns focused. We'll be sensitive to balance sheet and those types of things. So we have a lot of optionality to push the lever or the throttle forward or to pull it back, which is, I think, the position that we want to be in. So that's kind of a long-winded answer, but I think philosophically, we'll think about the returns we're getting, we'll think about the balance sheet and all those types of things. But we have a lot of optionality with what we have. Team continues to be better and better as evidenced by the capital efficiency, and we've tried to slice and dice that in multiple ways, everything from high-level graph that shows our capital efficiency to some of the specifics. And again, feel free to ask Ray about some of those. I think when you look at them versus peers, they're impressive numbers. So it's -- that's kind of, philosophically, how we look at it."

We marketed that in 2 pieces. The southern package was actually in the STACK play. It was about roughly 9,000 acres, scattered across 3 counties, kind of small broken-up pieces within the play, collectively producing about 5 million per day equivalent net from 200 wells -- 200 all-legacy vertical wells. You can do the math there. So the price that we got for that, we though was a very strong price for that kind of position, particularly in today's market. When you look at the northern piece, which is bigger and about 19,000 net acres, it's mainly in Major County, predominantly in Major County, which is north of the STACK play, but the play is clearly moving in that direction and there's rigs coming right up to us. And it's also in the emerging Osage play, and there's other plays. So we actually have 8 rigs drilling in and around us. It's all HBP. So our thoughts are to just wait, watch some of the drilling results that we expect will be good and then just sell into a better price. So we have -- because it's HBP, we have the optionality of time. So I think you'll see us sell that and market it in due time. There's a lot of drilling activity [indiscernible] You can probably take a map of our acreage, it was up on our website at one time or the IR team will give it to you. And so you can look at the active rigs, I'm sure if you subscribe to those services. There's a lot of activity around us. In this -- the remaining stuff we have in the Panhandle and up in the Northern Oklahoma, I think, you'll just see us sell us with time, but we'll do it at an opportune time. It's similar to the Nora sale. We didn't just -- Nora, we had to find the right buyer at the right time, and we were very pleased with the sale. Hopefully, it's a win-win for both sides. But it's finding that buyer that really likes the asset. Bradford County was the same thing. I know people that follow us, we have that for sale for a long time. We were very disciplined, and we finally found the buyer the paid us what we thought was the price. I think if you look at both of those cases, the price we got was about double what most of the people thought Nora or Bradford County was worth. So I think the remaining stuff in Oklahoma, particularly that northern part of the acreage in Major County, is just picking the right time and the right buyer.

If you look at Page 8 in our presentation, we show what we've been able to do literally, and what I think that matters at the bottom line is the total cost per lateral foot. And you look at that over the years and you've seen really good improvements. And even across years, where service costs are actually going up, we were making significant improvements. A lot of that is driven by drilling longer laterals. It's just the fact that our teams and our service crews are getting more and more experienced. And all of those things factoring in are allowing us to keep doing what we're doing. And I think that you're going to see probably half of our wells, it could be less, it could be more. I mean, we're really, really early in the planning cycle at this point. But some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks and when you couple the savings or the fact that you don't have to build pads and roads and production facilities, other things that we don't talk a lot about or like things like survey, land, title, curative, we got water infrastructure and depending on where that pad is in relation to the current water infrastructure we have in place. And all of those things, you could save a couple of hundred thousand a well, you could save up to $850,000 a well, depending on the particular situation. And I think those kinds of savings are real. I think it's taken us lots of years to develop a very large core asset area. We've got a great low base decline rate, which allows us to build very efficiently with the capital that we allocate. We've got some -- clearly, some really high-prolific performing areas like I went through in my remarks. A couple of those example there that we can focus on. We've got new infrastructure that's always continually still being built like some of the new dry gas stuff I talked about in my remarks. So I think it's just all when you roll all that together, the fact that we've got a great transportation portfolio, we've got diverse outlets for operational aspects as far -- and as far as pricing aspects. A lot of these things have taken years to develop. All of our HBP concerns are covered this year. And so we've got a great future going forward. And I think we can just continue that capital efficiency. The service contractors can continue to operate, give us pricing because of the high utilization rates. We don't think anyone else in the basin is operating at the number of fracs per day that we are anywhere close. So I think there's a lot of things out there like that, that just gives us a pretty unique advantage when you compare us to all our peers."

Two questions, I guess, around that is, one, do you see that expanding at all? Or are you pretty content there? And then secondly, when you do some of these dry Utica gas wells there in order to keep the cost down, what things can you do? I mean, I guess, because of the pressure, I mean, do you still have to use a ceramic versus the sand? I'm just wondering what things you can do in that area to keep the cost down on those dry Utica wells."

I think as we've seen future -- more and more develop",596,"Two great questions. I think the gas-in-place maps we've had for a long time internally, and then, of course, we've made them public, I guess, 2 or 3 years back. And they're actually holding very true. I think as we've seen future -- more and more development occur in the Utica and the Upper Devonian and portion of the Marcellus, I think they've held really true. I think it's going to be like most plays historically have been where the true core sweet spots tend to shrink and so forth. And I think that's big reason behind our low base decline rate. I think we have better hydrocarbons -- better hydrocarbon content, I should say, better perm, better porosity, better pressures, and so we get better desorption of gas in the long run. And a lot of those things help us. But I think they're going to hold pretty true. Clearly, the Utica is really, really early, especially on the Pennsylvania side. But we're pretty pleased about that.  Going forward on the Utica, we think when we get ready to do the next well, and we're not sure when exactly that's going to be yet, but we can do, based on what we know today, 6,500-foot lateral for around $12 million, probably less now. An 8,000-foot lateral or so, we can probably do for about $14 million or less. We think that's probably an industry-leading cost already. We're a little bit shallower than some of the other wells, so there's a little bit less cost there. We, in our last well, completed it with -- I think it was 5,800 feet, with 38 stages, and we were 500,000 pounds per stage. And it was 50:50 100 mesh and 40/70 premium white sand. So we don't think ceramics is going to be necessary at least in our acreage. That's going to keep cost way down. Of course, every well that you get under your belt, you learn a lot more. So a little bit less science is required. We will continue to drill these wells on existing Marcellus pads. So you've got a lot of savings there like we've talked about previously. And I think all of those things set us up well. We're pretty convinced that 40,000 acres is going to be really high-quality stuff. But at this point in time, as good as we can do, it's still 2.5x more expensive than a dry gas Marcellus well in the Eastern part of Washington County. And when you look at that, some of these Marcellus wells that I've talked about in my prepared remarks, we're making about the same volume, if not more, in a years' time. And we can get it for 2.5x less dollars. So that's where we're going to focus our capital, especially in this market. But do we believe that Utica can be a big deal going forward? Yes. Do we believe it can be influential? Yes. Do we believe it's going to be competitive? No. We think it's going to be complementary, because it's something that's stacked with our Marcellus stuff. So I think that's where we see that going forward. But we're very encouraged. And again, I'll refer you to Page 35, I think it is in our presentation, and look at how it performs versus some of our offset peers' wells that have been real noteworthy, and they're all great wells. No doubt about it. But I think what we're seeing is our acreage can be right up there among the best acreage that there is in the play."

Then you go",739,"Yes, Dave. This is Ray. It's a great question. And again, the savings, the $200,000 to $500,000, let's say, or $600,000, whatever it might be in a particular case, that's going to be the dirt work things like the building the pad and the road. Then you got the actual production facilities, which, as you know, the separators, the production tanks, the heater treaters and all those different things. They're going to be different in the super-rich versus the wet versus the dry area. They're all different. And I think people tend to group this together and say it's going to be the same all the way across. And they forget that: number one, we have a really position; and number two, it's really diverse. And so we've got lots of different designs of facilities that we deal with. But it's going to be all of the meter taps and things like that. Then you've got things like damages that you play to the land owners, survey costs, title curative, you got a lot of different things like that we don't talk a whole lot about, which are really significant. You've got water infrastructure, if it's a pad that's right near an impoundment or right on a pipeline network. Of course, the water cost could vary by several hundred thousand dollars on a pad. And some of the new things that we're doing lately, today, we're saving, on average, probably $300,000, maybe $350,000 per pad on water cost. Was that significant? When you're drilling a new full-well pad, it's really significant, if you just go back and add 1 or 2 wells on a pad. So I think those things are all the capital costs that role in there. If you think about going back onto an existing pad and there's room in the gathering system, which is why we would go back onto an existing pad, you don't have to add any more compression or low-pressure pipe. And when you do that, those are -- that's a significant part of the cost in our gathering, compression and transportation line, which is, I think it was $0.99 or whatever it was for the first quarter. Significant piece of that is that low-pressure gathering and compression charge. When you go back with an existing well, you could see those numbers be a lot less. And I'm not going to quote a number because they're all different. But it could be -- most of that cost goes away, essentially, and you're really only looking at a variable cost of fuel and a few little things like that of putting new production online into that existing system. So there are a lot of things like that, that help us. And then it's just as far as LOEs and things, the way it helps you there is basically, you're not adding new equipment and new infrastructure that you have to add new lease operators for -- to cover. In other words, going back onto an existing pad doesn't cause us to add more personnel, it doesn't cause us to really add a lot more chemicals or maintenance or anything else like that. It's the kind of stuff that's already there and being operated. So I don't know, it's a long-winded roundabout way to kind of talk about some of those things. But all that helps us reach the capital efficiencies that we're with. And again, this has been a process that we actually talked about in the very early days, way back in 2007 and 2008 when we started drilling and building some of these pads. And it's been a goal all along to build these pads where we can go back and drill as many as we can, 15, 18 wells in some cases. And we were always really focused on the fact of having diverse outlets, diverse pricing scenarios for our products and not being dependent upon any one situation or project. All of those things have really helped us. And this year's really a turning point-year for us because of some of the big projects like Mariner East coming online, Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City was a pipeline project that we worked on for years. Later this year, we got the Gulf Coast project coming online. All of these things have taken years to put in place. And I think that's a very unique part of our story going forward."

So we've got that flexibility to go both ways. And it really comes down to what gets us the best overall project return for our capital in a year's time. Where are we going to be able to put a dollar in? Where are we going to get the most dollars out? And it's really that simple.

That's -- on a $0.50 a gallon product, that's a big deal. We're hedging international spreads on probably 1/3 of our second half of '16 production, and that's looking really good.

On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely picking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway. At the same time, we are now loading propane on VLGCs and shipping it to various international markets. 
The ability to ship ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook is a significant competitive advantage for Range. As an E&P company, we're now able to connect a large percentage of our NGL production to end markets, the buyers and consumers. As represented in our guidance for 2016, it has a meaningful impact on both NGL production and pricing. 
Given our transportation contracts for 2017, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving Range's expected natural gas differentials going forward. By the end of 2017, we expect to increase the amount of natural gas to be sold outside of the Appalachian Basin to about 82% of production. On the asset sale front, we recently closed the sale of our Bradford County acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania. The sale price was approximately $112 million. This was our only non-operated position in the Marcellus. 
We have also recently signed a purchase and sale agreement for our southern acreage package in the STACK play in Oklahoma. We have agreed to sell around 9,200 net acres and approximately 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production from approximately 200 wells in Blaine, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties for about $77 million. We expect to close by the end of May. The remaining northern acreage package is predominantly in Major County, Oklahoma, consists of approximately 19,000 net acres and is on trend in North of the existing STACK play and is in the emerging Osage play. Given that this play and other plays are moving in a direction of our position, we believe this acreage will increase in value with time in additional drilling results. Our plans will be to keep it for now since it's primarily HBP, and we'll look at the possibility of selling it at a more opportune time in the future. 
Importantly, with these 2 asset sales of approximately $190 million, we expect no increase in absolute debt in 2016 as compared to year-end 2015 based on current pricing. This type of neutral budget preserves our balance sheet and liquidity while allowing the macro environment time to improve. 
On the operations front, our team continues to optimize our development. We continue to improve both capital and operating efficiencies. Ray will discuss this and give some specific examples in his discussion. The Marcellus, specifically in Southwest Pennsylvania, will continue to be the focal point of our activity this year. As Ray will mention, we drilled some outstanding new wells and the performance of some of the older wells continues to impress. 
Our third dry Utica well is performing better than the first 2 wells and appears to be one of the top wells in the entire Utica play. It's great to have 400,000 net acres of dry Utica potential beneath our Marcellus acreage, which gives us options down the road. The deciding factor for Range will ultimately be what are the economics of the Utica versus a Marcellus, will we allocate -- we will allocate capital to the wells with the best economics, and right now, that means our Southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus development. 
In 2016, we're projecting lower well cost, the impact of improved price realizations, better transportation capabilities and lower all-in unit cost. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range and one of the reasons we're able to replace production so efficiently with maintenance CapEx of approximately $300 million or less. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play, combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. 
For 2015, our expected finding cost using current development cost to recover PUD reserves was $0.40 per Mcfe at year-end, significantly lower than the expectations of other natural gas producers. In the price environment the industry is facing today, the ability to develop reserves more efficiently is the key advantage for Range. Utilizing a finding cost of $0.40 or better, coupled with our projected 2016 all-in cash cost and looking at 2017 strip prices, our projected unhedged recycle ratio approaches 2. As Ray mentioned on his last call, in our best areas, our projected unhedged recycle ratio is over 2. 
In summary, the first quarter was meaningful for Range. We had a significant marketing project become operational, we've got noncore asset sales that further high-grade our assets and keep debt unchanged at year-end and we continue to see improving well results across our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, all of which sets up well -- sets up Range well for 2016 and into 2017. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

What I'll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward. 
We continue to remain focused on capital allocation, and our production growth is a result of high-quality properties being developed by a strong technical team. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.38 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and for the second quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.41 Bcf equivalent per day with 32% to 35% liquids. Of note, during the second quarter, we expect to fully replace all the production sold from our 3 sales and our annual guidance moves to the high end of our previous guidance and is now expected to be 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. We believe this year will look very similar to previous years with sequential quarterly growth, and our exit rate will be higher than it was at the end of 2015, setting us up well for 2017. 
For the first quarter, we continue to drive down our overall unit cost, resulting in a reduction of 10% from the prior year quarter. Basically, all of the categories beat guidance. One particular item that I would like to call your attention to is the LOE. Our operating teams continue to operate more efficiently. And when combined -- and when coupled with recent asset sales, our LOE per Mcfe is 37% lower than a year ago and 14% lower than the prior quarter. 
Capital efficiency continues to improve. I'll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,324 stages with 2.25 crews during the quarter, setting another record. Compared to the first quarter of 2015 with the same number of crews, this is a 28% improvement. March was a record month with 526 stages. We averaged 7.1 stages per day per crew, which is an improvement of 9% from a year ago. And in spite of completing longer laterals, we completed 15% more wells in the quarter than a year ago. 
We've seen our water cost dramatically improve as a result of logistics, planning and some creative new management tools, resulting in savings of over $350,000 per pad. These efficiency improvements resulted in a 31% reduction in total completion cost per foot of lateral compared to a year ago. On the drilling side for the first quarter, we achieved a 20% reduction in drilling cost per foot as compared to last year while drilling 50% more lateral feet per day per well on average. Said another way, we drilled 50% faster and saved 20% on our drilling cost. 
All this helps us on 2 very significant fronts. First, we get better pricing from our service partners as they can count on very high utilization rates. While we don't make the terms of our service contracts public, what's important is that we believe that Range has the lowest cost per thousand foot of lateral in the basin. And secondly, we get our wells to sales faster, reducing the time from capital spend to sales. Therefore, improving our capital efficiency. Essentially, with the same number of crews, we completed 15% more wells in the first quarter than we did a year ago. 
I'll refer you back to Slide 8 in our updated presentation, illustrating the improvements in capital efficiency that we've achieved over the past several years. These examples that I've just covered should clearly illustrate why we expect to continue to improve into the future. And most importantly, we continue to work safely and environmentally responsibly. 
Our cost savings have not been at the expense of well performance. We continue to achieve outstanding well results. We recently brought online 5 wells on a new 7 well pad in our super-rich area. The wells had an average lateral length of 6,000 feet and were completed with an average of 31 stages. The wells were produced under facility constrained conditions and had an average 24-hour initial rate to sales of over 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 65% liquids. 
Earlier in the quarter, we brought online a 3-well pad also in the super-rich area, with average initial production to sales of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 63% liquids. It's early but clearly, these pads may significantly outperform the averages, and they represent examples of areas where we can focus more capital in the future. 
In our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online 2 different pads worthy of mention. Together, these pads include 10 wells averaging 7,500-foot laterals completed with 39 stages. With 9 of those 10 wells online, again, under constrained conditions, the 9 wells achieved an average initial rate to sales of about 16 million a day per well. These 2 pads represent opportunities in our dry gas areas where we have fairly new and low-cost gathering systems with ample takeaway and many more multi-well pads and long lateral wells that we can develop going forward. 
On the last call, we discussed the flexibility of going back to existing Marcellus pads to drill additional wells. This morning, I'd like to get into more specifics on a few particular examples. The first example is the pad that's described in our -- that has been described in our presentation for some time now and is currently on Page 39 of our updated presentation. About 2 years ago, we went back onto a 2-year-old Marcellus pad and drilled 2 new infill laterals between the existing laterals. In this particular example, because the pad, road, water infrastructure, production facilities and so forth were already in place, the wells were $850,000 less expensive per well on average than the original well, even though they were 50% longer laterals. 
The new wells were landed with improved targeting technology and completed with updated frac designs. And after 600 days, the new wells produced 53% more than the original wells. And importantly, the new wells which were spaced at 700 and 900 feet, respectively, did not impact the production of the original wells. 
A second example is in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back onto an existing 3-well pad and drilled 3 new laterals. You can see this example on Page 41. The original wells had an average lateral length of 4,800 feet completed with 25 stages and the average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions, was 22.6 million a day per well. The new wells were drilled about 1 year later, averaging almost 8,700-foot laterals completed with 45 stages and under facility constraints, have an average initial 24-hour rate to sales of over 34 million a day per well. That's a 50% improvement in initial rates from the -- over the older wells. This is one of our very prolific areas that's performing well above our average type curve, with many opportunities to drill additional wells on this pad and nearby pads. 
A third example is in our wet area of Southwest Pennsylvania, where we went back onto a 2-well existing pad and added 5 new wells with longer laterals and, again, newer completion technology. You can find this one on Page 40. The original wells were completed in 2010 and had an average lateral length of 3,700 feet completed with 13 stages. And the average initial 24-hour rate to sales was 6.7 million a day equivalent per well. 5 years later, in 2015, we completed 5 new wells, averaging 5,200-foot [ph] laterals, completed with 27 stages, and these new wells had an average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions of 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well, which is over 300% improvement in initial rates. 
While we still have many new pads to develop, to restate what we said on the last call, we also have 124 pads with 5 or fewer wells in addition to 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells. This represents over 180 pads where we have the potential to go back and drill additional wells in any of our stacked pay intervals, whether it's Marcellus, Upper Devonian or Utica. 
While all these pads represent unique and different opportunities, it's important to point out that we have the potential to drill wells with reduced capital as significant infrastructure is already in place, lower operating costs as we develop new efficiencies, less gathering and compression as limited incremental infrastructure is needed when you're on an existing pad, potentially improved performance as in the previous examples and very little to no impact on the existing production. All of this results in a step change improvement in capital efficiencies and an even lower F&D, like I discussed on the last call. 
Another added and significant benefit is the much shorter execution time. And we avoid the need for any additional surface disturbance. Again, it's very early in our planning cycle, but we could potentially drill about 50% of our wells next year on existing pads, and we believe the savings per well could range from $200,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on each particular situation. Some cases could be more. Again, we believe this is a unique advantage for Range. 
As you know for years now, we've been showing type curves in our presentation on a normalized lateral length basis for the average of the actual wells that we bring to sales in a given year, all under the actual constrained conditions. We believe our average EURs per thousand foot are the best in the Southwest portion of the play, and that's among a strong performing group of our peers. We also believe our average cost per thousand foot are the lowest in the entire play. Again, these are the averages expected in a given year and we've always presented the prior year's production performance to support those type curves. 
What I'd like to do now is steer away from the averages for a moment and point out a couple of specific areas. Let me begin with an area in the dry gas portion of Washington County. This example consists of 22 wells from 4 separate well pads, in which we are projecting the average recovery is 3.1 Bcf per thousand foot. These wells have an average lateral length of 6,300 feet and the EUR is 21% better than our average dry gas area type curve. These wells have a minimum of 180 days and as much as 2 years of production history. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million using a flat $3 NYMEX price, the internal rate of return is 61%.  We're planning on turning to sales this year an additional 23 wells from 5 pads in this area, with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet. 
Referring to the previous example I described in the wet  gas area, we turned to sales 5 wells again, which is illustrated on Page 40, where we drilled on an existing pad. The new wells have a projected EUR of 3.6 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot of lateral. This is 22% higher than our average EUR for the wet area type curve. These wells have been online for 11 months. Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, the return on these wells using a flat $3 NYMEX price is 34%. We're planning on turning to sales over the next 12 months an additional 9 wells from 2 pads in this area, with an average lateral length of over 5,800 feet. 
We expect to continue with longer laterals going forward. In 2014, our average lateral length drilled was 4,915 feet. In 2015, it was about 6,300 feet. And this year, we expect the average to be about 7,100 feet. While it's still early in our planning cycle for 2017, we expect to drill wells that average around 8,000 feet of lateral length. Ultimately, we expect that we'll be drilling 10,000-foot laterals on average in the dry area and probably slightly less than that in the liquids areas. Just as a point out, we're planning to turn to sales 2 wells later this year in the range of 9,500-foot laterals, and we'll also drill 3 laterals over 13,000 feet this year with the longest planned for 16,220 feet of lateral length. 
Importantly, our HB efforts are largely behind us after this year. Our land budget in 2014 was over $200 million. In 2015, we spent approximately $70 million. And this year, our land budget is reduced to approximately $20 million. Our development plan has positioned us to increase our flexibility going forward by allowing us to focus our capital on the very best return projects. 
While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to remember are: we have a large core position, low cost structure, strong capital efficiency, drilling longer laterals, an attractive transportation portfolio, ability to drill on over 180 existing pads as well as new pads, ability to focus in our best and most prolific areas, ability to increase liquids production when economically warranted, a low decline base production, very low maintenance CapEx and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. 
To answer the common question about maintenance CapEx, if you consider what I've discussed here this morning regarding our ability to drill on existing pads, along with targeting some of our better areas, and couple that with our low base decline rate of approximately 19%, we have the ability to hold our 2017 production flat to this year's expected exit rate for $300 million or less. We believe this low level of maintenance CapEx makes our production incredibly resilient if prices were to stay low while providing us a solid base to grow from when the supply and demand equation improves and prices move higher. The point is, that whatever prices do and wherever we set the drilling throttle, having a really low maintenance CapEx works in our favor. 
Shifting to marketing. Utilizing our Mariner East transportation, Range loaded the very first VLGC from the East Coast with 550,000 barrels of propane on March 19. Range also saw the first INEOS ethane ship set sail from the East Coast during the first quarter. Both ethane and propane ships are now leaving Marcus Hook on a regular basis, and having international exposure for our products is expected to benefit our netback pricing going forward. 
Looking ahead, our next transportation option coming into service is the Texas Eastern Gulf Market's expansion project, expected to start later this year. This project will allow us to ship more production to the Gulf Coast region, anticipating a positive impact to our sales portfolio. By the end of this year, we'll have about 70% of our gas sold outside the basin. And like Jeff said earlier, by late '17, we'll have over 80% of our gas sold outside the basin, which we expect to result in better netback pricing. 
As a further update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H is currently shut-in for facilities buildout and an extended bottom hole pressure buildup. We expect to bring the well to sales in about 60 days. The just over 30-day flow back test initiated immediately after completion, again, with no aging, averaged 18.3 million a day to sales, with the gas rate essentially held flat with high flowing pressures. You can see how this well's performance compares to some of the nearby and noteworthy Utica wells drilled by our peers on Page 35 in our updated presentation. Early data indicates that this well could be one of the top wells to date in the play. Our current expectations are that the well will be put to sales at approximately 12 million a day. The first phase of the reservoir modeling suggests it should hold that rate flat for approximately 500 days before declining. We'll know a lot more in a few months once we complete the next phase of our data acquisition and modeling and the well is actually put to sales, but again, early indications are good. 
As most of you know, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently far exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development. And over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor our 3 wells along with the offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there. 
In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our core assets, we remain well positioned to create value. 
Over to Roger."

There are many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continued to effectively position the company for the current economic environment and a future with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing. Starting with the balance sheet",799,"Thanks, Ray. There are many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continued to effectively position the company for the current economic environment and a future with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing. 
Starting with the balance sheet this time, we ended the quarter with less debt than we entered and our capital spending plans are right on track to produce prudent growth and production and reserves with improving capital efficiency. A major highlight of the quarter was the unanimous reaffirmation of our annually determined $3 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. Beyond the committed liquidity it provides, looking behind the numbers at the approval process, reveals 3 significant positive read-throughs. First, the reaffirmation excluded the collateral value associated with the December 2015 Nora sale and the 2 more recent asset sales, which in aggregate exceeded $1 billion in sales proceeds.
[Audio Gap]
The strength of our banking relationships and the unique portfolio of value-added marketing arrangements we have for our natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which will improve future pricing. Our recycle ratio, based on our year-end 2015 reserve report F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure, projected 2016 basis to NYMEX and current unhedged strip price for 2017, is approaching 2x, ensuring that we can continue to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. 
As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe an underappreciated element, the balance sheet strength and preservation, is having an unhedged recycle ratio above 1x, which allows for both growth and debt reduction at the same time, over time. Our first quarter ending debt-to-EBITDAX ratio for the past 3 years has been 3x, 2.8x and 2.9x, respectively. The ratio at the end of this year's first quarter is a very manageable 3.3x. As a reminder, Range has no debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, no bond maturities until 2021, $1.3 billion in freshly committed liquidity, low maintenance capital requirements, fleet control over our capital spending level and timing and a robust recycle ratio well over 1x. With prices improving, our recycle ratio will also continue to improve and the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will eventually crest over or decline with no negative impact to our operations. 
Turning to the income statement, comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of last year, the impact of 45% lower realized prices could not be offset through production growth and cost reductions. First quarter net loss was $92 million, largely prompted by a $43 million pretax impairment of certain Oklahoma properties. First quarter earnings based on analyst methodology, which eliminates noncash and nonrecurring entries, was a loss of $17 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share. 
On the cost side of the ledger, cash unit costs were down $0.01 from last year, and total unit cost, including DD&A, was down $0.29 from last year. All cost categories came in below guidance, with direct cash operating cost at $0.19 per Mcfe, breaking the $0.20 level for the first time. The main reason for the large operating cost beat was the absence of a severe winter and the avoided cost of tending to our wells with added shifts during periods of extreme cold. Transportation, gathering and compression were also well below guidance at $1 per Mcfe. This positive variance to guidance may be attributed to lower cost associated with our production mix and also lower transportation cost that were avoided due to the delayed full system startup of the Mariner East project. 
Second quarter expense guidance may be found in the earnings release, and other useful costs and hedging data, as Laith mentioned, may be found in the supplemental tables posted to the Range website. 
Cash flow for the first quarter was $99 million, and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.59. First quarter EBITDAX was $135 million. Range remains well hedged in 2016, with more than 80% of our 2016 gas production carrying a floor of 322 MMBTU. As 2017 and 2018 NYMEX gas prices have improved and because our full cycle cost structure is so low, we have commenced limited natural gas hedging in these years to reduce downside price risk and ensure cash flow is available for growth. We've also added to our NGL hedge position during the quarter, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q, earnings release and on the website. 
To summarize the first quarter, we've continued to successfully shed noncore assets, decrease debt, reduce our cost structure and improve our capital efficiency while delivering consistent growth. Looking ahead, we see continued disciplined growth with even better capital efficiency, plus improved pricing from our new ethane, propane and condensate marketing arrangements. As Ray described in his remarks, this sets us -- really sets us up well for '17 and beyond. 
Jeff, I'll turn it back to you."

I think, let me talk about it in a very conceptual way and start with, again, I think we're in a great position. We're in the highest quality gas play that's there with economics, I think, that really rival any play. It's a stacked pay area. By the end of this year, it's predominately HBP, so we've got a lot of optionality, not only in drilling Marcellus, Utica or Upper Devonian, but drilling wet or dry. We've got really low maintenance CapEx, which I think is important and I think is -- if it isn't best-in-class, it's clearly right up there, coupled with really good marketing agreements. Now that a lot -- our newest piece that's in place, Mariner East, so the ability to move ethane, propane or natural gas, really, to multiple markets around the U.S. or even internationally, the ability to go back on existing pads, those are all key things. So I think what you'll see us do is we're in great shape in a low-price environment. We believe that a lot of good fundamentals are setting up for natural gas to improve, rolling -- we think this will be the first year natural gas supply rolls since 2005 or something back like that, and coupled with a time where demand's coming up. So in a lower -- for longer scenario, we're well-positioned. In a higher-price scenario, we have a lot of optionality. Ray's talked about it and can continue to talk about. I think when you look at our frac-ing efficiency, it's probably best-in-class or right up there, number of -- our drilling efficiency in wells. So we have the ability to ramp when need be. But we're going to be very returns focused. We'll be sensitive to balance sheet and those types of things. So we have a lot of optionality to push the lever or the throttle forward or to pull it back, which is, I think, the position that we want to be in. So that's kind of a long-winded answer, but I think philosophically, we'll think about the returns we're getting, we'll think about the balance sheet and all those types of things. But we have a lot of optionality with what we have. Team continues to be better and better as evidenced by the capital efficiency, and we've tried to slice and dice that in multiple ways, everything from high-level graph that shows our capital efficiency to some of the specifics. And again, feel free to ask Ray about some of those. I think when you look at them versus peers, they're impressive numbers. So it's -- that's kind of, philosophically, how we look at it."

We marketed that in 2 pieces. The southern package was actually in the STACK play. It was about roughly 9,000 acres, scattered across 3 counties, kind of small broken-up pieces within the play, collectively producing about 5 million per day equivalent net from 200 wells -- 200 all-legacy vertical wells. You can do the math there. So the price that we got for that -- we, though -- was a very strong price for that kind of position, particularly in today's market. When you look at the northern piece, which is bigger and about 19,000 net acres, it's mainly in Major County, predominantly in Major County, which is north of the STACK play, but the play is clearly moving in that direction and there's rigs coming right up to us. And it's also in the emerging Osage play, and there's other plays. So we actually have 8 rigs drilling in and around us. It's all HBP. So our thoughts are to just wait, watch some of the drilling results that we expect will be good and then just sell into a better price. So we have -- because it's HBP, we have the optionality of time. So I think you'll see us sell that and market it in due time. There's a lot of drilling activity by -- and I won't -- you can -- but I think a map of our acreage was up on our website at one time or the IR team will give it to you. And some -- you can look at the active rigs, I'm sure if you subscribe to those services. There's a lot of activity around us. In this -- the remaining stuff we have in the Panhandle and up in the Northern Oklahoma, I think you'll just see us sell us with time, but we'll do it at an opportune time. It's similar to the Nora sale. We didn't just -- Nora, you had to find the right buyer at the right time, and we were very pleased with the sale. Hopefully, it's a win-win for both sides. But it's finding that buyer that really likes the asset. Bradford County was the same thing. I know people that follow us, we had that for sale for a long time. We were very disciplined, and we finally found a buyer that paid us what we thought was the price. I think if you look at both of those cases, the price we got was about double what most of the people thought Nora or Bradford County was worth. So I think the remaining stuff in Oklahoma, particularly that northern part of the acreage in Major County, it's just picking the right time and the right buyer. But you'll see us sell that with time."

If you look at Page 8 in our presentation, we show what we've been able to do literally, and what I think that matters at the bottom line is the total cost per lateral foot. And you look at that over the years and you've seen really good improvements. And even the cross years, where service costs are actually going up, we were making significant improvements. A lot of that is driven by drilling longer laterals. It's just the fact that our teams and our service crews are getting more and more experienced. And all of those things factoring in are allowing us to keep doing what we're doing. And I think that you're going to see probably half of our wells, could be less, could be more. I mean, we're really, really early in the planning cycle at this point. But some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks and when you couple the savings or the fact that you don't have to build pads and roads and production facilities, other things that we don't talk a lot about or like things like survey, land, title, curative, we got water infrastructure and depending on where that pad is in relation to the current water infrastructure we have in place. And all of those things, you could save $200,000 a well, you could save up to $850,000 a well, depending on the particular situation. And I think those kinds of savings are real. I think it's taken us lots of years to develop a very large core asset area. We've got a great low base decline rate, which allows us to build very efficiently with the capital that we allocate. We've got some -- clearly, some really high-prolific performing areas like I went through in my remarks. A couple of those example there that we can focus on. We've got new infrastructure that's always continually still being built like some of the new dry gas stuff I talked about in my remarks. So I think it's just all when you roll all that together, the fact that we've got a great transportation portfolio, we've got diverse outlets for operational aspects as far -- and as far as pricing aspects. A lot of these things have taken years to develop. All of our HBP concerns are covered this year. And so we've got a great future going forward. And I think we can just continue that capital efficiency. The service contractors can continue to operate -- give us great pricing because of the high utilization rates. We don't think anyone else in the basin is operating at the number of fracs per day that we are anywhere close. So I think there's a lot of things out there like that, that just give us a pretty unique advantage when you compare us to all our peers."

And then secondly, when you do some of these dry Utica gas wells there, in order to keep the cost down, what things can you do? I mean, I guess because of the pressure, I mean, do you still have to use a ceramic versus the sand? I'm just wondering what things you can do in that area to keep the cost down on those dry Utica wells."

I think the gas-in-place mats, we've had for a long time internally, and then, of course, we've made them public, I guess, 2 or 3 years back. And they're actually holding very true. I think as we've seen future -- more and more development occur in the Utica and the Upper Devonian and of course in the Marcellus, I think they've held really true. I think it's going to be like most plays historically have been where the true core sweet spots tend to shrink and so forth. And I think that's a big reason behind our low base decline rate. I think we have better hydrocarbons -- better hydrocarbon content, I should say, better perm, better porosity, better pressures, and so we get better desorption of gas in the long run. And a lot of those things help us. But I think they're going to hold pretty true. Clearly, the Utica is really, really early, especially on the Pennsylvania side. But we're pretty pleased about that. Going forward on the Utica, we think when we get ready to do the next well, and we're not sure when exactly that's going to be yet, but we can do, based on what we know today, a 6,500-foot lateral for around $12 million, probably less now. An 8,000-foot lateral or so, we can probably do for about $14 million or less. We think that's probably an industry-leading cost already. We're a little bit shallower than some of the other wells, so there's a little bit less cost there. We, in our last well, completed it with -- I think it was 5,800 feet, with 38 stages, and we were 500,000 pounds per stage. And it was 50/50 100 mesh and 40/70 premium white sand. So we don't think ceramics is going to be necessary at least in our acreage. That's going to keep cost way down. Of course, every well that you get under your belt, you learn a lot more. So a little bit less science is required. We will continue to drill these wells on existing Marcellus pads. So you've got a lot of savings there like we've talked about previously. And I think all of those things set us up well. We're pretty convinced that our 400,000 acres is going to be really high-quality stuff. But at this point in time, as good as we can do, it's still 2.5x more expensive than a dry gas Marcellus well in the Eastern part of Washington County. And when you look at that, some of these Marcellus wells that I've talked about in my prepared remarks, we're making about the same volume, if not more, in a year's time. And we can get it for 2.5x less dollars. So that's where we're going to focus our capital, especially in this market. But do we believe that Utica can be a big deal going forward? Yes. Do we believe it can be influential? Yes. Do we believe it's going to be competitive? No. We think it's going to be complementary, because it's something that's stacked with our Marcellus stuff. So I think that's where we see that going forward. But we're very encouraged. And again, I'll refer you to Page 35, I think it is, in our presentation, and look at how it performs versus some of our offset peers' wells that have been real noteworthy, and they're all great wells. No doubt about it. But I think what we're seeing is our acreage can be right up there among the best acreage that there is in the play."

Then you've got the actual production facilities, which is the separators, the production tanks, the heater treaters, all those different things. They're going to be different in the super-rich versus the wet versus the dry area. They're all different. And I think people tend to group this together and say it's going to be the same all the way across. And they forget that: number one, we have a really position; and number two, it's really diverse. And so we've got lots of different designs of facilities that we deal with. But it's going to be all of the meter taps and things like that. Then you've got things like damages that you play to the land owners, survey costs, title curative, you got a lot of different things like that, that we don't talk a whole lot about, which are really significant. You've got water infrastructure, if it's a pad that's right near an impoundment or right on a pipeline network, of course, the water cost could vary by several hundred thousand dollars on a pad. And some of the new things that we're doing lately, today, we're saving, on average, probably $300,000, maybe $350,000 per pad on water cost. Well, which that's significant. When you're drilling a new full-well pad, it's really significant, if you just go back and add 1 or 2 wells on a pad. So I think those things are all the capital costs that roll in there. If you think about going back onto an existing pad and there's room in the gathering system, which is why we would go back onto an existing pad, you don't have to add any more compression or low-pressure pipe. And when you do that, those are -- that's a significant part of the cost in our gathering, compression and transportation line, which is, I think it was $0.99 or whatever it was for the first quarter. Significant piece of that is that low-pressure gathering and compression charge. When you go back with an existing well, you could see those numbers be a lot less. And I'm not going to quote a number because they're all different. But it could be -- most of that cost goes away, essentially, and you're really only looking at the variable cost of fuel and a few little things like that of putting that new production online into that existing system. So there are a lot of things like that, that help us. And then it's just as far as LOEs and things, the way it helps you there is basically, you're not adding new equipment and new infrastructure that you have to add new lease operators for to cover. In other words, going back onto an existing pad doesn't cause us to add more personnel, it doesn't cause us to really add a lot more chemicals or maintenance or anything else like that. It's the kind of stuff that's already there and being operated. So I don't know, it's a long-winded roundabout way to kind of talk about some of those things. But all that helps us reach the capital efficiencies that we're with. And again, this has been a process that we actually talked about in the very early days, way back in 2007 and 2008 when we started drilling and building some of these pads. And it's been a goal all along to build these pads where we can go back and drill as many as we can, 15, 18 wells in some cases. And we were always really focused on the fact of having diverse outlets, diverse pricing scenarios for our products and not being dependent upon any one situation or project. All of those things have really helped us. And this year's really a turning point-year for us because of some of the big projects like Mariner East coming online, Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City was a pipeline project that we worked on for years. Later this year, we've got the Gulf Coast project coming online. All of these things have taken years to put in place. And I think that's a very unique part of our story going forward."

Some of these wells that I talked about the recent performance and then some of the existing wells that we've done and following up like that example of the 10 different wells from several different pads. When you look at that, the economics on that stuff is, even if you build a new pad, is probably better than going back on some of the existing pads in today's world in the wet and super-rich area. So we've got that flexibility to go both ways. And it really comes down to what gets us the best overall project return for our capital in a year's time. Where are we going to be able to -- put a dollar in, where are we going to get the most dollars out? And it's really that simple.

Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in strong operating results for the quarter. Comparing unit cost realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17% and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and are continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail. All 3 of our liquids projects are now fully operational, and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from MarkWest to anywhere in the world, we are selling to the Northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines were contracted on are either online or on schedule, including Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Colombia's Express in the third quarter 2017 and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017. By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachia Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachia Basin. Gas pricing women challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there were signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the 2 plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work including all associated cost to put the wells online would result in the an additional $4 billion of capital per year. It's also important to note that the drill uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are historical lows and production in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014, and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking into 2017, the NYMEX drip has moved above $3, and we believe it can continue to climb. there is also a brighter outlook for ethane and profane for 2017. At Range, if these prices increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back onto to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decrease us the cycle-time to ramp up. Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we have also the ability to sift capital to drill in the dry, wet and the super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a realtime basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there is available space and the portion of gathering system, we will direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering cost. We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe the combining 2 of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with the resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the 2 lowest cost gas plays in The United States and are strategically located in near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and enhance the ability to server our end customers. The product mix in both assets were similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer in transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane. 
On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified ideas that can enhance the economics of Lower cotton Valley resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. 
Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure, and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit cost, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles and result in a better stronger company. 
In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first, is very high quality, low-cost asset base in 2 complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency as illustrated by the opportunity to go back to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is like operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by the Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of the 2017. 
Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success.

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We are focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to a highest quality properties, improving capital efficiency and continuing to drive down cost in all categories. Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcfe per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcfe per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high-end at 1.41 to 1.42 Bcfe per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we are still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017. We continue to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better-than-expected, but I believe they are worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are example of our teams driving down cost and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with the focus on environmental responsibility. Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flow back and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some creative and innovative thinking, our team will save $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost. These savings is driven primarily by 3 things. First, improved designs, meaning a greater focus on placement and conductivity rather than water volume. Second, a steady and highly efficient program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that's supply reused water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost. And third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore, developing advantages that are very unique to operational in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage. And now having a water that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom line cost. Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I will go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of as we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per lateral by 25% compared to last year. Our top 4 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day of total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again was already 25% lower than last year. We are forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling costs per foot compared to last year, while driving 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and 7 of our top 10 for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we are really still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well today was an 8,634-foot lateral, drilled at the cost that 38% lower than our average, again with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year. As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you will begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiencies that we expect to see going forward. This combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure as well as with the drilling longer laterals, suggest we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical teams and by all of our folks across the company. 
Today we can drill a 9000-foot lateral and completed with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand-new four well pads for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. Over a million dollars less on apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in a better economics than any of our peers in the southwest portion of the basin. I should point out that this is not just We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we planned to drill a 7 well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. I would like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing well. We recently completed the 7-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sale under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day since it was 73% liquids. In the wet area, our top pad was a 3-well pad averaging 6,782 laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet per day. And in our dry area, at Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a 5-well pad, averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales again under constrained conditions was 26.7 million cubic feet a day. I would also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within last 9 months. 
Let me start with the dry area in County. This is the 5-well pad that I mentioned that was brought online with April, 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on Page 42, where we went back on that pad and drilled additional wells. This 5-well pad is similar and recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per thousand foot or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to be cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all of these well costs that I refer to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top 2 wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future. In the wet area, we turn to 4-well pad, averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in the similar area as the wet area pad in the presentation on Page 41, where we went back and drilled additional wells. This 4-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcfe per thousand feet or approximately 28 Bcfe per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today. In the super-rich area, we brought online 2 pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average laterals to 5100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcfe per thousand foot or 14 Bcfe per well, costing $4.8 million. 
On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. Today I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently we have an inventory of over 2,030 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, a 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals. We can go back onto the pads as needed when there is room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all of the permit necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage in existing pad inventory. Considering Pennsylvania, the cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all of the permitting that goes with it. Civil engineering and environmental permitting entitle can take a long time. On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned in line is around 9 months for a full well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand that cycle time can be less than half that depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allow us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come online to sales in short order. While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high quality position; our acreage is largely held our production; low cost structure; strong capital efficiency; we're drilling longer laterals, we have and attractive low-cost transportation portfolio; the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads; permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right; the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquid-rich areas, a low decline base production of 19%; very low maintenance CapEx; and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allow -- allocate capital to our highest return projects across our large core, diverse and stack pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. Year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is, we have a portfolio of low-cost takeaway capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio a $150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra, Market project at a very reasonable transport fee. Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach Rain Express project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional $300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast, where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachia Basin. Once Leach Rain Express is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin. We recently signed new condensate sales agreement, which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first half  realized prices. On the NGL side, Mariner East began efficiently flowing ethane and propane to market circ on May 1. INEOS is lowering their state-of-the-art shifts with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of market and realizing prices above not These liquids marketing arrangements has significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year. We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMZ 10H for which we're currently in the process of conducting a production floor test. The test is part of our larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with the flowing pressure and rate within the top 4 wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter. As I have said in the past, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with an anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, is clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time, we expect that the Utica can be complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our 3 wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine to path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stack pay core assets, we remain well-positioned to create sustainable long-term value. Now I would like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials."

The biggest second quarter story on the finance side, is a dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash",695,"Thank you, Ray. The biggest second quarter story on the finance side, is a dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well head treatment cost and utilities. While not all of these cost production will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, now lets focus on cost and the benefit of having shed significant non-core assets over the past year, have moved are already low-cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit cost were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit cost from prior guidance. It's amazing to note that 6 years ago, in 2009, our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expenses combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined cost fell below $3 per Mcfe. And 3 years later in 2013, the combined cost fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating of properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past 7 years and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark. As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team. Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow for fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet, for the third consecutive quarter, Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May, 2012. A period when our daily production was 50% less from the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion revolving base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements for the Memorial transaction, and once approved by shareholders, no bank waivers or other consents are required to affect the merger. We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure can unhedge NYNEX pricing for 2017. Our recycle ratio is approximately 2x. Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well-hedged in 2016 with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at full price of 3 22 per Mcfe and just over 3 30 MMBtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production is hedged at $2.94 per Mcfe.  We have also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release in company website. 
In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with lower natural gas, oil and NGL price coming off a mild winter and high-energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is a bonus. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 prices and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements, provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016. With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new takeaway capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well-positioned for our future of disciplined capital efficient growth with the opportunity to accelerate as wanted. Jeff, back to you."

Where the infrastructure is, differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability, not only the good, we think we can make them better. We are in good shape this year, but I think -- no, when you look forward, I think, a couple of things will happen. One, I think you will see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a good record and doing that. It's really early. And we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when you look at current forecast and current pricing, where things are today with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow. As we project forward, we believe for some of the reasons I said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to, but if you look in our IR slides, there are a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas, gas production declining. We are in the highest quality pieces. oil, gas, associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, I think our team believes, gas in a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, I think your company deck shows it, gas prices as you go out, look. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly into ramp up with increased cash flows as gas price improve. So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strips are bad predictor for future prices. But even at where strip is, I think next year somewhere around 3 10 that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated in both sides can grow. Both sides, I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they are probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability cash flow increases, we can -- we have plenty of places to drill, to be able to ramp, to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it's kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I have answered your question."

What I talked about for the water, $18 million savings, $9 million worth of savings in facilities. It's what we do every year. We take those improvements, and whether it's drilling more feet of lateral for less cost or whether it's more stages in a day or combined with the fact that the wells continue to do better than we project and flatter declines and shifting more to dry, all of that stuff helps us optimize our capital allocation if you want to look at it that way. And what we generally end up doing is, we either drill more wells, complete more wells, kind of on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells and those 8 more wells in line, but they are probably really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better. So that's typically what happens every year."

So I think again, if you look forward and we have stuff in our IR presentation, there is a lot of natural gas demand coming. I think our power generation ultimately long-term, I think gas is going to be, continue to take market share. Its a cleaner, better fuel regardless of which administration gets in or what the laws are, it's just a -- it's a better fuel. Gas exports to Mexico have surprised to the upside. I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least 8 per day go, and that's already started up. Lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, '18. And I think once the infrastructure gets build and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just wanted to little with a high-powered professor from the University. He puts it differently. He says the world's moving to what move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas there is more hydrogen atoms per carbon atom than there is for coal or oil or other fuels.

As we continue to move gas out of the basin, lot of that incremental capacity goes to the Gulf Coast where the demand is going to be. And I think it's important to note as well on our NGLs, we only had a partial year really Mariner East started up day 1   -- partial quarter, partial year. So as you look into 2017, the pricing should get better for NGLs as well. We have a full year of Mariner East. We have a new agreement, I think Ray mentioned, so we will have a full year of that. And the other thing is, again, we expect natural gas prices to get better going forward, but there is a good story brewing for NGLs as well. ethane demand coming on, we at Range being the first company to export ethane by ship in partnership with Sonoco and INEOS. But Enterprise is starting to export a lot of ethane later this year, coupled with all the petrochemical demand that comes on in '17 and '18. So the U.S. is the biggest propane exporter. We will be a large ethane exporter and increasing demand. So there is a good story brewing not just for natural gas but for NGLs and for -- specifically for a Range because of the specific agreements we have. I have been back to the macro, as more ethane comes out of the gas stream that helps a little bit on the supply side as you take the ethane out of the gas stream."

And each one of those by their selves are larger than most of our peers total position. And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique models and unique targets and all that.

All of those things have to fit in your markets for -- how we're handling firm transportation and all those things work into this big master plan over the 5, 10-year outlook that we have. So I think you will see, like we have done every year, I think our type curves will continue to improve. I think our average has improved. And while I was trying to get across in this -- in my prepared remarks is that we have areas that are continuing to get better and better and are significantly above the average. And I think as we drill longer laterals and continue to improve our completion designs, I mean we're 12 years into this, and we're still finding better wells. And we're going back end of the some of those areas and doing that. And we have opportunities to drill brand new pads that make -- in a lot of cases, may have better economics and going at to an existing pad. It just depends on all of those things.

And I think, quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we've significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year, we finally reached that point where we're largely HBP-ed. There's always going to be a little bit acreage out there. But it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program, this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will to what we always done is, first look at returns and quality and get room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at. What -- the point I'm trying to get across and talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, and that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations in a couple of months, have wells online. I think that's a very unique advantage. We are not saying that's exactly what we're going to go like next year. I think, you're just going to see a mix of that plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making 4, 4.5 Bcf per thousand foot at $5 million in some cases. That's pretty impressive economics and those wells will greatly compete with going back on to an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on an existing pad. It's still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that.

We remain very excited about our pending merger with Memorial, but since we don't expect to close the transaction until mid- to late September, Ray and I will primarily focus our comments on the results, opportunities and plans for our Marcellus operations. In the next quarterly call, we expect to be able to talk more about our plans for the combined company. I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the second quarter, then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that set us up for continued success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in strong operating results for the quarter. Comparing unit cost realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17% and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and our wells continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail. 
All 3 of our liquids projects are now fully operational, and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from Marcus Hook to anywhere in the world or to sell into the northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines were contracted on are either online or on schedule, including Spectra's Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Colombia's Rayne/Leach XPress in the third quarter 2017 and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017. By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year-end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin. Gas pricing remains challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there were signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. 
In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the 2 plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work, including all associated cost to put the wells online would result in an additional $4 billion of capital per year. It's also important to note that the drill uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are at historic lows and productions in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014, and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking into 2017, the NYMEX drip has moved above $3, and we believe it can continue to climb. There's also a brighter outlook for ethane and propane for 2017. At Range, if these price increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back onto to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decreases the cycle time to ramp up. Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we also have the ability to shift capital to drill in the dry, wet or super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a real-time basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there is available space and a portion of the gathering system, we'll direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering cost. 
We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well, and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe the combining 2 of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the 2 lowest cost gas plays in The United States and are strategically located near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and enhance the ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer in transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to NOVA Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane. 
On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified transferable ideas that can enhance the economics of Lower Cotton Valley, resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. 
Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure procurement and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit cost, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles and result in a better stronger company. 
In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is the very high quality, low-cost asset base in 2 complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is top flag operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by the Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of the 2017. Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We are focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to highest quality properties, improving capital efficiency and continuing to drive down cost in all categories. 
Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcf equivalent per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high end at 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we're still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017. We continue to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better than expected, but I believe they're worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are examples of our teams driving down cost and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with a focus on environmental responsibility. Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flowback and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some very creative and innovative thinking, our team will save over $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost. This savings is driven primarily by 3 things. First, improved completion designs, meaning a greater focus on proppant placement and conductivity rather than water volume. Second, a steady and highly efficient frac program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that supply reuse water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost. And third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore, developing advantages that are very unique to our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage. And not having a water MLP that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom line cost. 
Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I will go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac producers we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 25% compared to last year. Our top 4 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day for a total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again, was already 25% lower than last year. We are forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, while driving 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and 7 of our top 10 days for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well today was an 8,634-foot lateral, drilled at a cost that was 38% lower than our average, again, with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year. As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiencies that we expect to see going forward. This combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure as well as with drilling longer laterals, suggest we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand new 4-well pad for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. Over a million dollars less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics than any of our peers in the southwest portion of the basin. I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we plan to drill a 7-well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells. We recently completed a 7-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day, since it was 73% liquids. In the wet area, our top pad was a 3-well pad, averaging 6,782-foot laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And in our dry area, at Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a 5-well pad, averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions was 26.7 million cubic feet a day. I'd also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within the last 9 months. 
Let me start with the dry area in Washington County. This is the 5-well pad that I mentioned earlier that was brought online in April of 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on Page 42, where we went back on the pad and drilled additional wells. This 5-well pad is similar and recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per thousand foot or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all these well costs that I refer to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top 2 wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future. In the wet area, we turned to 4-well pad, averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in a similar area as the wet area pad in the presentation on Page 41, where we went back and drilled additional wells. This 4-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcf equivalent per thousand feet or approximately 28 Bcf equivalent per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today. In the super-rich area, we brought online 2 pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average lateral length of 5,100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot or 14 Bcf equivalent per well, costing $4.8 million. 
On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. 
Today, I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals. We can go back onto the pads as needed when there is room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all of the permits necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage in existing pad inventory, considering Pennsylvania as a cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all of the permitting that goes with it. Civil engineering, environmental permitting and title can take a long time. On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned in line is around 9 months for a full well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand that cycle time can be less than half that depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allows us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come online to sales in short order. While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high quality position; our acreage is largely held by production; low cost structure; strong capital efficiency; we're drilling longer laterals; we have an attractive low-cost transportation portfolio; the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads; permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right; the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquids rich areas; a low decline base production corporately of 19%; very low maintenance CapEx; and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allow -- allocate capital to our highest return projects across our large core, diverse and stack pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. Year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is, we have a portfolio of low-cost takeaway capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio a $150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra Gulf Markets project at a very reasonable transport fee. Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach/Rayne Express project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional $300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast, where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. 
As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf Markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachian Basin. Once Leach/Rayne Express is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin. We recently signed new condensate sales agreement, which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first half realized prices. On the NGL side, Mariner East began efficiently flowing ethane and propane to Marcus Hook on May 1. INEOS is loading their state-of-the-art dragon class shifts with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of Marcus Hook and realizing prices above Mont Belvieu. These liquids marketing arrangements have significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year. We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H for which we are currently in the process of conducting a production flow test. The test is part of a larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with the flowing pressure and rate within the top 4 wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter. As I said in the past, the Utica cost almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our 3 wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine to path forward from there. In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stack pay core assets, we remain well positioned to create sustainable long-term value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials."
93030,365395838,1014071,"Range Resources Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray.

The biggest second quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well head treatment costs and utilities. 
While not all of these cost productions will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, a relentless focus on cost and the benefit of having shared significant noncore assets over the past year, have moved our already low-cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit costs were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit cost from prior guidance. It's amazing to note that 6 years ago, in 2009, our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expense combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined cost fell below $3 per Mcfe. And 3 years later, in 2013, the combined cost fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating our properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past 7 years, and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark. 
As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team. Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. For the third consecutive quarter, Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May of 2012, a period when our daily production was 50% less from the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion of borrowing base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing committed liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements for the Memorial transaction. And once approved by shareholders, no bank group waivers or other consents are required to effect the merger. We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year-end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost projected 2016 unit cost structure and unhedged NYMEX pricing for 2017. Our recycle ratio is approximately 2x. Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well-hedged in 2016, with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at a forward price of $3.22 per Mcfe and just over 330 Mmbtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production is hedged at $2.94 per Mcf. We've also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release in company website. 
In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices coming off of mild winter and high-energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is a bonus. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 historical prices, and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements, provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016. With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new takeaway capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well positioned for our future of disciplined capital efficient growth, with the opportunity to accelerate as wanted.

But -- I think -- we've got, I think, 2 really high-quality assets. And I would argue 2 best gas assets in the U.S., with room to improve both marketing advantages, the location, the whole thing. Where the infrastructure is, differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability, not only the good, we think we can make them better. So we're in good shape this year, but I think -- no, when you look forward, I think a couple of things will happen. One, I think you'll see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a great track record of doing that. It's really early, and we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when we look at current forecast and current strip pricing, where things are today with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow. As we project forward, we believe, for some of the reasons that I said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to, but if you look in our IR slides, there's a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas, gas production declining. We're in the highest quality pieces. Oil, gas -- associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, and I think our team believes, gas is a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, and I think your company's deck shows it, gas prices as you go out, look better. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly and to ramp up with increased cash flow as gas prices improve. So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strips are bad predictor for future prices, but even at where strip is, I think next year somewhere around $3.10, that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated in both sides can grow. Both sides, and I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they're probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability, cash flow increases, we can -- we have plenty of places to drill, to be able to ramp, to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it's kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I have answered your question."

As I mentioned, debt is lower at the end of the quarter than at the beginning, 3 consecutive quarters running.

And with positive recycle ratios of 2x for both companies on an unhedged basis, what that's telling me is that we'll be able to grow within cash flow powerfully and have the optionality to either bring the leverage down if that's what's called for or expand growth if that's what's the better option."

And what we generally end up doing is, we either drill more wells, complete more wells, kind of on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells and -- those 8 more wells in line, but they're probably really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better.

I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least 8 Bs per day go, and that's already started up. Lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, '18. And I think once the infrastructure gets build and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just went to a little symposium with a high-powered professor from a university. He puts it differently. He says the world is moving to let move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas, C1H4.

And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique reservoir models and unique targets and all that.

And I think, quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we have significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year, we finally reached that point where we're largely HBP-ed. There is always going to be a little bit of acreage out there. But it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program, this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will do what we've always done is, first look at returns and quality and get room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at. What -- the point I'm trying to get across and talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, and that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations and in a couple of months have wells online. I think that's a very unique advantage. We're not saying that's exactly what we're going to go like next year. I think you're just going to see a mix of that plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making 4, 4.5 Bcf per thousand foot at $5 million in some cases. That's pretty impressive economics and those wells will greatly compete with going back on to an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on a well on an existing pad. It still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that.

We remain very excited about our pending merger with Memorial, but since we don't expect to close the transaction until mid- to late September, Ray and I will primarily focus our comments on the results, opportunities and plans for our Marcellus operations. In the next quarterly call, we expect to be able to talk more about our plans for the combined company. I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the second quarter, then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that set us up for continued success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in strong operating results for the quarter. Comparing unit cost realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17% and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and our wells continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail. 
All 3 of our liquids projects are now fully operational, and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from Marcus Hook to anywhere in the world or to sell into the northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines we're contracted on are either online or on schedule, including Spectra's Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Colombia's Rayne/Leach XPress in the third quarter 2017 and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017. By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year-end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin. Gas pricing remained challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. 
In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the 2 plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work, including all associated cost to put the wells online would result in an additional $4 billion of capital per year. It's also important to note that the drilled uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are at historic lows and productions in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014, and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking into 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3, and we believe it can continue to climb. There's also a brighter outlook for ethane and propane for 2017. At Range, if these price increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back on to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decreases the cycle time to ramp up. Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we also have the ability to shift capital to drill in the dry, wet or super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a real-time basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there is available space and a portion of the gathering system, we'll direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering cost. 
We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well, and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe that combining 2 of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the 2 lowest cost gas plays in The United States and are strategically located near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and enhanced ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to NOVA Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane. 
On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified transferable ideas that can enhance the economics of Lower Cotton Valley, resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. 
Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure procurement and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit cost, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles and result in a better stronger company. 
In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is the very high quality, low-cost asset base in 2 complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is top flight operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by the Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of the 2017. Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success.

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We are focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to our highest quality properties, improving capital efficiency and continuing to drive down cost in all categories. 
Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcf equivalent per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high end of 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we're still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017. We continue to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better than expected, but I believe they're worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are examples of our teams driving down cost and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with a focus on environmental responsibility. Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flowback and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some very creative and innovative thinking, our team will save over $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost. This savings is driven primarily by 3 things. First, improved completion designs, meaning a greater focus on proppant placement and conductivity rather than water volume. Second, a steady and highly efficient frac program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that supply reuse water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost. And third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore, developing advantages that are very unique to our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage. And not having a water MLP that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom line cost. 
Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I will go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac crews as we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 25% compared to last year. Our top 4 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day for a total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again, was already 25% lower than last year. We are forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, while drilling 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and 7 of our top 10 days for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well to date was an 8,634-foot lateral, drilled at a cost that was 38% lower than our average, again, with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year. As we've covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. This combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure as well as with drilling longer laterals, suggest we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand new 4-well pad for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. Over a $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics than any of our peers in the southwest portion of the basin. I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we plan to drill a 7-well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells. We recently completed a 7-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day, since it was 73% liquids. In the wet area, our top pad was a 3-well pad, averaging 6,782-foot laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a 5-well pad, averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions was 26.7 million cubic feet a day. I'd also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within the last 9 months. 
Let me start with the dry area in Washington County. This is the 5-well pad that I mentioned earlier that was brought online in April of 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on Page 42, where we went back on the pad and drilled additional wells. This 5-well pad is similar in recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per thousand foot or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all these well costs that I refer to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top tier wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future. In the wet area, we turned a 4-well pad, averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in a similar area as the wet area pad in the presentation on Page 41, where we went back and drilled additional wells. This 4-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcf equivalent per thousand feet or approximately 28 Bcf equivalent per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today. In the super-rich area, we brought online 2 pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average lateral length of 5,100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot or 14 Bcf equivalent per well, costing $4.8 million. 
On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. 
Today, I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we could eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals. We can go back onto the pads as needed when there is room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all of the permits necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage and existing pad inventory. Consider in Pennsylvania the cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all of the permitting that goes with it. Civil engineering, environmental permitting and title can take a long time. On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned in line is around 9 months for a 4-well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand that cycle time can be less than half that depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allows us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come online to sales in short order. 
While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high quality position; our acreage is largely held by production; low cost structure; strong capital efficiency; we're drilling longer laterals; we have an attractive low-cost transportation portfolio; the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads; permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right; the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquids rich areas; a low declined base production corporately of 19%; very low maintenance CapEx; and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allow -- allocate capital to our highest return projects across our large core, diverse and stacked pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. Year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is, we have a portfolio of low-cost takeaway capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio a $150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra Gulf Markets project at a very reasonable transport fee. Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach/Rayne Express project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional 300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast, where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. 
As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf Markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachian Basin. Once Leach/Rayne Express is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin. We recently signed new condensate sales agreement, which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first half realized prices. 
On the NGL side, Mariner East began efficiently flowing ethane and propane to Marcus Hook on May 1. INEOS is loading their state-of-the-art Dragon class ships with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of Marcus Hook and realizing prices above Mont Belvieu. These liquids marketing arrangements have significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year. We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H for which we are currently in the process of conducting a production flow test. The test is part of a larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with a flowing pressure and rate within the top 4 wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter. As I said in the past, the Utica costs almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our 3 wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine to path forward from there. In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower costs, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stacked pay core assets, we remain well positioned to create sustainable long-term value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials."
93030,365395838,1014320,"Range Resources Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. The biggest second quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cas",697,"Thank you, Ray. The biggest second quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well head treatment costs and utilities. 
While not all of these cost productions will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, the relentless focus on cost and the benefit of having shed significant noncore assets over the past year, have moved our already low-cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit costs were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit cost from prior guidance. It's amazing to note that 6 years ago, in 2009, our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expense combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined cost fell below $3 per Mcfe. And 3 years later, in 2013, the combined cost fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating our properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past 7 years, and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark.  As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team. 
Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. For the third consecutive quarter, Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May of 2012, a period when our daily production was 50% less from the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion borrowing base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing committed liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements of the Memorial transaction. And once approved by shareholders, no bank group waivers or other consents are required to effect the merger. 
We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year-end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure and unhedged NYMEX pricing for 2017 our recycle ratio is approximately 2x. Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well-hedged in 2016, with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at a forward price of $3.22 per Mcfe and just over 330 Mmbtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production is hedged at $2.94 per Mcf. We've also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release and company website. 
In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices coming off of mild winter and high-energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is upon us. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 historical prices, and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements, provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016. With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new takeaway capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well positioned for a future of disciplined capital efficient growth, with the opportunity to accelerate as warranted.

Let me start shorter term and then move out to longer term. But -- I think -- we've got, I think, 2 really high-quality assets and, I would argue, the 2 best gas assets in the U.S., with room to improve both marketing advantages, location, the whole thing. Where the infrastructure is, differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability, not only are they good, we think we can make them better. So we're in good shape this year, but I think when you look forward, I think a couple of things will happen. One, I think you'll see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a great track record of doing that. It's really early, and we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when we look at current forecast and current strip pricing, where things are today with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow. As we project forward, we believe, for some of the reasons that I said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to, but if you look in our IR slides, there's a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas. Gas production declining, we're in the highest quality pieces. Oil, gas -- associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, and I think our team believes, gas is a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, and I think your company's deck shows it, gas prices as you go out, look better. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly and to ramp up with increased cash flow as gas prices improve. So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strip's a bad predictor for future prices, but even at where strip is, I think next year somewhere around $3.10, that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated, and both sides can grow. Both sides, and I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they're probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability, cash flow increases, we can -- we have plenty of places to drill, to be able to ramp, to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it's kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I have answered your question."

And with positive recycle ratios of 2x for both companies on an unhedged basis, what that's telling me is that we'll be able to grow within cash flow powerfully and have the optionality to either bring the leverage down if that's what's called for or expand growth if that's what's the better option."

And what we generally end up doing is, we either drill more wells, complete more wells, kind of on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells in -- those 8 more wells in line, but they'll probably really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better.

So I think, again, if you look forward, and we have stuff in our IR presentation, there is a lot of natural gas demand coming. I think power generation, ultimately, long-term, I think gas is going to be -- continue to take market share. It's a cleaner, better fuel regardless of which administration gets in or what the laws are. It's just that it's a better fuel. Gas exports to Mexico have surprised to the upside. I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least 8 Bs per day go, and that's already started up. A lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, '18. And I think once the infrastructure gets built and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just went to a little symposium with a high-powered professor from a university. He puts it differently. He says the world is moving to let move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas, C1H4, there's more hydrogen atoms per carbon atom than there is for coal or oil or other fuels. It's a cleaner, better fuel. So I think the strip is just a poor predictor of the future."

A lot of ethane demand coming on, we at Range being the first company to export ethane by ship with -- in partnership with Sonoco and INEOS. But Enterprise is starting to export a lot of ethane later this year, coupled with all the petrochemical demand that comes on in '17 and '18. So the U.S. is the biggest propane exporter.

And each one of those by their selves are larger than most of our peers total position. And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique reservoir models and unique targets and all that. And so we're always trying to manage -- trying to allocate our capital to the very highest return wells, but you also had to factor in the fact of is there room in the gathering system to put more wells in that area.

And while I was trying to get across in this -- in my prepared remarks is that we have areas that are continuing to get better and better and are significantly above the average. And I think as we drill longer laterals and continue to improve our completion designs -- I mean, we're 12 years into this, and we're still finding better wells. And we're going back into some of those areas and doing that. And we have opportunities to drill brand new pads that, in a lot of cases, may have better economics than going back to an existing pad. It just depends on all of those things. So it's a good point.

And I can't quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we have significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year, we finally reached that point where we're largely HBP-ed. There is always going to be a little bit of acreage out there. But it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program, this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will do what we've always done is, first look at returns and quality and get room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at. What -- the point I'm trying to get across and talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, in that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations and in a couple of months have wells online. I think that's a very unique advantage. We're not saying that's exactly what we're going to go next year. I think you're just going to see a mix of that plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making 4, 4.5 Bcf per thousand foot at $5 million in some cases. That's pretty impressive economics and those wells will greatly compete with going back on to an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on a well on an existing pad. It still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that. But the good news is, going forward, we don't have that anchor of needing to HBP acreage around our neck any further going -- now going forward."

We remain very excited about our pending merger with Memorial, but since we don't expect to close the transaction until mid- to late September, Ray and I will primarily focus our comments on the results, opportunities and plans for our Marcellus operations. In the next quarterly call, we expect to be able to talk more about our plans for the combined company. I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the second quarter, then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that set us up for continued success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in strong operating results for the quarter. Comparing unit cost realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17% and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and our wells continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail. 
All 3 of our liquids projects are now fully operational, and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from Marcus Hook to anywhere in the world or to sell into the northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines we're contracted on are either online or on schedule, including Spectra's Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Colombia's Rayne/Leach XPress in the third quarter 2017 and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017. By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year-end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin. Gas pricing remained challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. 
In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the 2 plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work, including all associated cost to put the wells online would result in an additional $4 billion of capital per year. It's also important to note that the drilled uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are at historic lows and productions in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014, and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking into 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3, and we believe it can continue to climb. There's also a brighter outlook for ethane and propane for 2017. At Range, if these price increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back on to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decreases the cycle time to ramp up. Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we also have the ability to shift capital to drill in the dry, wet or super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a real-time basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there is available space and a portion of the gathering system, we'll direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering cost. 
We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well, and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe that combining 2 of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the 2 lowest cost gas plays in The United States and are strategically located near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and enhanced ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to NOVA Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane. 
On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified transferable ideas that can enhance the economics of Lower Cotton Valley, resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. 
Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure procurement and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit cost, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles and result in a better stronger company. 
In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is the very high quality, low-cost asset base in 2 complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is top flight operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by the Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of the 2017. Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success.

We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We are focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to our highest quality properties, improving capital efficiency and continuing to drive down cost in all categories. 
Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcf equivalent per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high end of 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we're still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017. We continue to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better than expected, but I believe they're worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are examples of our teams driving down cost and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with a focus on environmental responsibility. Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flowback and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some very creative and innovative thinking, our team will save over $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost. This savings is driven primarily by 3 things. First, improved completion designs, meaning a greater focus on proppant placement and conductivity rather than water volume. Second, a steady and highly efficient frac program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that supply reuse water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost. And third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore, developing advantages that are very unique to our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage. And not having a water MLP that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom line cost. 
Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I will go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac crews as we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 25% compared to last year. Our top 4 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day for a total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again, was already 25% lower than last year. We are forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, while drilling 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and 7 of our top 10 days for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well to date was an 8,634-foot lateral, drilled at a cost that was 38% lower than our average, again, with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year. As we've covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. This combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure as well as with drilling longer laterals, suggest we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand new 4-well pad for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. Over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics than any of our peers in the southwest portion of the basin. I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we plan to drill a 7-well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells. We recently completed a 7-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day, since it was 73% liquids. In the wet area, our top pad was a 3-well pad, averaging 6,782-foot laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a 5-well pad, averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales, again, under constrained conditions was 26.7 million cubic feet a day. I'd also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within the last 9 months. 
Let me start with the dry area in Washington County. This is the 5-well pad that I mentioned earlier that was brought online in April of 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on Page 42, where we went back on the pad and drilled additional wells. This 5-well pad is similar in recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per thousand foot or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all these well costs that I refer to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top tier wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future. In the wet area, we turned a 4-well pad, averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in a similar area as the wet area pad in the presentation on Page 41, where we went back and drilled additional wells. This 4-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcf equivalent per thousand feet or approximately 28 Bcf equivalent per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today. In the super-rich area, we brought online 2 pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average lateral length of 5,100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot or 14 Bcf equivalent per well, costing $4.8 million. 
On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. 
Today, I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we could eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals. We can go back onto the pads as needed when there is room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all of the permits necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage and existing pad inventory. Consider in Pennsylvania the cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all of the permitting that goes with it. Civil engineering, environmental permitting and title can take a long time. On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned in line is around 9 months for a 4-well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand that cycle time can be less than half that depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allows us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come online to sales in short order. 
While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high quality position; our acreage is largely held by production; low cost structure; strong capital efficiency; we're drilling longer laterals; we have an attractive low-cost transportation portfolio; the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads; permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right; the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquids rich areas; a low declined base production corporately of 19%; very low maintenance CapEx; and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allow -- allocate capital to our highest return projects across our large core, diverse and stacked pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. Year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is, we have a portfolio of low-cost takeaway capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio a 150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra Gulf Markets project at a very reasonable transport fee. Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach/Rayne Express project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional 300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast, where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. 
As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf Markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachian Basin. Once Leach/Rayne Express is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin. We recently signed new condensate sales agreement, which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first half realized prices. 
On the NGL side, Mariner East began efficiently flowing ethane and propane to Marcus Hook on May 1. INEOS is loading their state-of-the-art Dragon class ships with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of Marcus Hook and realizing prices above Mont Belvieu. These liquids marketing arrangements have significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year. We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H for which we are currently in the process of conducting a production flow test. The test is part of a larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with a flowing pressure and rate within the top 4 wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter. As I said in the past, the Utica costs almost 2.5x more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us that our high-quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our 3 wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine to path forward from there. In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower costs, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stacked pay core assets, we remain well positioned to create sustainable long-term value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials."

The biggest second quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cas",698,"Thank you, Ray. The biggest second quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing cost, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well head treatment costs and utilities. 
While not all of these cost productions will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, the relentless focus on cost and the benefit of having shed significant noncore assets over the past year, have moved our already low-cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit costs were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit cost from prior guidance. It's amazing to note that 6 years ago, in 2009, our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expense combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined cost fell below $3 per Mcfe. And 3 years later, in 2013, the combined cost fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating our properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past 7 years, and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark. As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team. 
Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. For the third consecutive quarter, Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May of 2012, a period when our daily production was 50% less from the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion borrowing base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing committed liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements of the Memorial transaction. And once approved by shareholders, no bank group waivers or other consents are required to effect the merger. 
We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year-end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure and unhedged NYMEX pricing for 2017 our recycle ratio is approximately 2x. Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well hedged in 2016, with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at a forward price of $3.22 per Mcfe and just over 330 Mmbtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production is hedged at $2.94 per Mcf. We've also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release and company website. 
In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices coming off of mild winter and high-energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is upon us. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 historical prices, and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements, provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016. With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new takeaway capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well positioned for a future of disciplined capital efficient growth, with the opportunity to accelerate as warranted. 
Jeff, back to you."

Let me start shorter term and then move out to longer term. But -- I think -- we've got, I think, 2 really high-quality assets and, I would argue, the 2 best gas assets in the U.S., with room to improve both marketing advantages, location, the whole thing. Where the infrastructure is, differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability, not only are they good, we think we can make them better. So we're in good shape this year, but I think when you look forward, I think a couple of things will happen. One, I think you'll see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a great track record of doing that. It's really early, and we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when we look at current forecast and current strip pricing, where things are today with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow. As we project forward, we believe, for some of the reasons that I said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to, but if you look in our IR slides, there's a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas. Gas production declining, we're in the highest quality pieces. Oil, gas -- associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, and I think our team believes, gas is a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, and I think your company's deck shows it, gas prices as you go out, look better. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly and to ramp up with increased cash flow as gas prices improve. So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strip's a bad predictor for future prices, but even at where strip is, I think next year somewhere around $3.10, that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated, and both sides can grow. Both sides, and I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they're probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability, cash flow increases, we can -- we have plenty of places to drill, to be able to ramp, to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it's kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I have answered your question."

And with positive recycle ratios of 2x for both companies on an unhedged basis, what that's telling me is that we'll be able to grow within cash flow powerfully and have the optionality to either bring the leverage down if that's what's called for or expand growth if that's what's the better option."

And what we generally end up doing is, we either drill more wells, complete more wells, kind of on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells in -- those 8 more wells in line, but they'll probably really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better.

So I think, again, if you look forward, and we have stuff in our IR presentation, there is a lot of natural gas demand coming. I think power generation, ultimately, long term, I think gas is going to be -- continue to take market share. It's a cleaner, better fuel regardless of which administration gets in or what the laws are. It's just that it's a better fuel. Gas exports to Mexico have surprised to the upside. I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least 8 Bs per day go, and that's already started up. A lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, '18. And I think once the infrastructure gets built and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just went to a little symposium with a high-powered professor from a university. He puts it differently. He says the world is moving to let move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas, C1H4, there's more hydrogen atoms per carbon atom than there is for coal or oil or other fuels. It's a cleaner, better fuel.

But Enterprise is starting to export a lot of ethane later this year, coupled with all the petrochemical demand that comes on in '17 and '18. So the U.S. is the biggest propane exporter.

And each one of those by their selves are larger than most of our peers total position. And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique reservoir models and unique targets and all that.

All of those things have to fit in markets for -- how we're handling firm transportation and all those things work into this big master plan over the 5, 10-year outlook that we have.

And while I was trying to get across in this -- in my prepared remarks is that we have areas that are continuing to get better and better and are significantly above the average. And I think as we drill longer laterals and continue to improve our completion designs -- I mean, we're 12 years into this, and we're still finding better wells. And we're going back into some of those areas and doing that. And we have opportunities to drill brand new pads that, in a lot of cases, may have better economics than going back to an existing pad. It just depends on all of those things. So it's a good point.

Just wondering, how do you think about this just simply as far as improved potential well returns and then versus the need to hold acres to drill? Because it's certainly seems you have tremendous opportunity to come back and save cost, obviously, improve returns here.

And I can't quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we have significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year, we finally reached that point where we're largely HBP-ed. There is always going to be a little bit of acreage out there. But it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program, this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will do what we've always done is, first look at returns and quality and get room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at. What -- the point I'm trying to get across and talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, in that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations and in a couple of months have wells online. I think that's a very unique advantage. We're not saying that's exactly what we're going to go next year. I think you're just going to see a mix of that plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making 4, 4.5 Bcf per thousand foot at $5 million in some cases. That's pretty impressive economics and those wells will greatly compete with going back on to an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on a well on an existing pad. It still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that. But the good news is, going forward, we don't have that anchor of needing to HBP acreage around our neck any further going -- now going forward."

We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well.

The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcellus shale division and the new North Louisiana division. 
I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the quarter and then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that I believe set us up for success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in solid operating results for the third quarter and due to the closing date, 15 days of solid performance from the North Louisiana team were represented in the quarterly numbers. 
The third quarter took us one step closer to seeing meaningful improvements in realized prices across an of our products. First, all 3 of our liquids projects were online during the quarter, [indiscernible] Mariner West and Mariner East. We sold ethane to Europe, Canada and to the Gulf Coast and exported propane for market sold in international markets. The net effect is that our NGL price increase from 13% of WTI to 25% of WTI on a year-over-year basis. 
Second, we have a new condensate sales agreements, which commenced on July 1. These agreements approved our corporate condensate realizations from a $13 [ph] differential to WTI to a $6 differential to WTI on a year-over-year basis and the similar improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Third, NYMEX gas prices were higher in the third quarter and all of the gas pipelines we are contracted on are expected to be on schedule. This includes Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion, which came online earlier this month on October 4. This transportation allows us to move in additional $150 [ph] million per day of all Marcellus production to the Gulf Coast. 
Like the Uniontown Gas City pipeline, which became operational this time last year, this project immediately improves our expected Marcellus netbacks. The next 2 projects for Range are Colombia's Leach/Rayne XPress and ATP's Rover Phase II, both of which have received first final EIS approval and both of which we understand will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
As a result of this increased transport in our growing North Louisiana production, we expect to see corporate natural gas differentials improving to approximately $0.46 next quarter based on current's strip pricing and approximately $0.33 in 2017. All else being equal, these improved netbacks should improve margins substantially in 2017, and we expect further improvements in 2018. 
Let me turn to North Louisiana and give an update there. The integration, as I mentioned earlier, is going very well and the North Louisiana division is accomplishing a lot. Let me give a few examples. 
First, we just set a record for the fastest spud to rig release of any well drilled today in Terryville field and then repeated that record with the second well. In addition, we just completed one of the best producing wells ever drilled in the field to date. Our Purchasing Department has also made good progress, and we're achieving cost reductions on that front as a result. Ray will talk more specifically about these accomplishments and improvements in a few minutes. 
The North Louisiana team has also had some really success refinery the targeting and landing in the Lower Cotton Valley. As an example, they just finished drilling some wells that were entirely within a much tighter target within the Upper Red. Once we complete the wells, we'll see what effect this has on performance. 
It's early, but we're also excited about the North Louisiana expansion areas. The team has drilled the pilot holes for the first 3 expansion wells, all testing new area several miles away from Terryville and far away from each other. 
Based on extensive logs, courts and shows, all 3 vertical pilots look very encouraging. In addition, we have drilled in case the horizontal onto laterals on 2 of the 3 pilot holes. Again, the results to date look encouraging. 
The third lateral is currently being drilled. We expect to have all 3 wells drilled, completed and tested by the end of this year. The results of the will help provide additional data regarding the extension areas that will be rolled into our planning for 2017 and 2018. 
On a macro level, there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of the year. 
Based on available data, it appears 2016 will be the first time that natural gas production will decline on a year-over-year basis since 2005. This supply decline is happening, while demand for natural gas is increasing, driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking towards 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved about [ph] $3, and we think it can continue to climb. 
Based on where strip pricing is today, we believe that we can grow the combined company at 33% to 35% for 2017. This equates to an organic growth rate of 11% to 13% for 2017, coupled with the full year of the North Louisiana division versus roughly a quarter in 2016. 
Importantly, this preliminary plan for 2017 also results in strong growth for 2018. Assuming a 3 25 per Mcfe and $60 [ph] per barrel, we are projecting that we should achieve organic growth for 2018 of approximately 20%. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Lower Cotton Valley assets are 2 of the lowest-cost gas plays in the United States, which resulted in a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. This combination creates a unique portfolio that is strategically located near key demand centers with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. 
The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. 
In summary, we believe that Range offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is a very high quality low-cost asset base in 2 very supplementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. 
Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting, wells are driving improved growth in both regions. 
The third key attribute is top tier operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. 
The fourth is a strong marketing effort highlighted by the Range's ability to sell its products to into multiple markets enhanced by nearly acquired North Louisiana assets and demonstrated and are expecting pricing improvements across all products heading into the fourth quarter of 2016 and further into 2017. 
Finally, Range has an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Excluding the asset sales and the North Louisiana volumes, we expect to grow 10% over last year as previously guided, while maintaining our capital expenditure level at approximately $495 million. And importantly, we plan to end 2016 with an exit rate higher than last year, setting us up well for 2017 and beyond. 
We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and this is something that we're really proud of. Specifically, driving this improvement in the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 35% reduction in LOE year-to-date versus the average for 2015. This was achieved through 3 key areas. One, leveraging service cost with our long-term vendor relationships; two, reductions in third-party manpower; and three, the savings associated with our water handling through our water logistics team, which gets water from our production pads to our frac operation quicker than ever. 
Staying with our Marcellus activity, capital efficiency continues to improve. And I'll review some examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
On the water front, we've continued the improvements that we discussed on the last call and we'll reduce our capital expenditures for water by over $20 million this year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 20% as compared to last year. 
Our top 3 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.5 stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 23% below the average, which, again, was already 20% lower than last year. 
We're forecasting a 16% reduction in CapEx for production facilities resulting in almost $6 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and material and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we've achieved a 5% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, and 8 of our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day have been this year. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward. 
As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. Again, all of this being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages in our wet area with full facilities on a new build full well pad for approximately $7.2 million per well. 
In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. In fact over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics. 
As we point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. Like I reported on the last call, we are now drooling a 7-well pad in our super-rich area averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells during the third quarter, but before I do that, I want to remind everyone that these rates will all be reported as constrained actual rates to sales. 
In our dry area, a 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 5,300 [ph] feet and 28 stages per well was completed and had an average 24-hour rate to sales of 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day. 
In our wet area, 2 pads showed excellent results. A 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 6,800 feet and 35 stages produced at 22 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and a 6-well pad with an average lateral length of 4,500 feet and 23 stages produced at $19 million a day per well. 
On the last couple of calls, we've also discussed our unique advantage of the expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells that lower cost, thereby increasing capital efficiencies, while allowing us to ramp up quicker than any of our peers. 
Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals at very attractive cost. 
Although it's early in the planning process, in Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about 1/3 of our wells on existing pads in 2017. That number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is planned to be over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that 2018 average lateral length will be longer. Again, these are early estimates and will most certainly change over time. 
What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads, and we have permits at hand with infrastructure in place to yield further improving capital efficiencies going forward. 
Shifting now to North Louisiana. The integration is going very well. We'll be operating those assets out of our new North Louisiana division office in Houston under the direction of John [indiscernible], Senior Vice President of the new North Louisiana division, who has relocated to Houston from our Southern Marcellus division in Pittsburgh. 
[indiscernible], now Vice President of the Southern Marcellus division, stepped up to take over the Southern Marcellus shale division. We are extremely proud of both of these gentlemen and their accomplishments. The record is clear. And through their leadership, we expect continued improvements in capital efficiency, coupled with improving well performance in both areas. 
When we originally evaluated the Memorial assets, our expectations were that we can improve over the already impressive results they had seen there. For example, we felt there was potential in terms of drilling times and costs, coupled with improvements in well performance by optimizing the target window and staying in [indiscernible], all of which, which should result in improved efficiencies and productivity over time. 
Even though we've only had the Range for approximately 6 weeks, as Jeff referred to in his remarks, John and the new team are already achieving some significant wins. We just set the record for spud to rig release in Terryville of 30 days and have now repeated it on the second well. To date, this year, the wells averaging more than 5,000 feet of lateral length, the average has been 40 days. This 25% improvement in efficiency was achieved by implementing more aggressive bps and high-speed, high differential motors. 
A lot of these ideas and many more coming are the result of the spring and [indiscernible] as our new Vice President of drilling. Scott has a ton of experience in high-pressure high-temperature drilling across the world and was actually involved in the vertical drilling in the Vernon Field. We expect Scott and his new team will be able to significantly improve drilling performance and cost as we go forward. 
In the last batch of wells that were completed, we also saw one of the highest productive wells in Terryville to date. It had a 30-day IP to sales of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day per 1,000 foot or over 27 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is 68% [ph] higher than the average. 
We believe this is a real testament to both the team and the quality of the rock in Terryville and clearly illustrates that there is more potential yet to be unlocked as we further develop the Upper Red, along with the stack pay opportunities in Terryville field. 
Like I said many times over the years in the Marcellus, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet in Terryville. 
We've also had equipped well on targeting. We're drilling in the Upper Red prior to Range, the target for the lateral Range from 100 to 125 feet big [ph], encompassing most of the reservoir. We believe there may be significant performance improvements by incorporating an approach where we target only the best across the interval, which is 20 to 40 feet big, and then staying that much smaller target window for 100% of the lateral. We've already accomplished this on a few wells and expect to announce those results next year when those wells are completed. 
Bringing the bear to supply chain advantages of Range has also resulted in an early win. For example, we've already saved 7% in casing cost resulting in savings of over $50,000 per well, and we expect that there will be many examples of this going forward. 
As illustrated in these few early examples, we believe strongly that we can lower cost, improve well performance, improve operational efficiencies and lower our unit cost, while working safely and being good stewards of the environment and the communities where we live in the. We will be putting the beer operating philosophy of steady and strategic planning, implementing innovative and sound technology -- technologies and processes that have worked for us in the Marcellus while putting up with a long-term approach focused on economic and value enhancing growth. 
Like Jeff mentioned, we're currently working on the 3 extension [indiscernible] of wells. 2 of the wells are in the completion phase and the third round is nearing completion of the drilling phase. We expect to be able to have initial results from these 3 wells before year-end. 
Looking at the data collected thus far, the Upper Red sands and these wells have an average gas in place concentration, that is Bcf per vertical foot that is on par with the Upper Red in the very best part of Terryville, and they're twice as big, yielding twice the gas in place as the Upper Red sands in Terryville. The lower red sands have an average gas in place concentration nearly 3x fat [ph] of the best Lower Red in Terryville. Considering these wells are deeper and have a high year pressure gradient, we interpret the higher reservoir pressure better gas in place and the favorable reservoir parameters to be cause for optimism regarding these areas in the basin. 
Of course, we won't know for sure until we see the actual production from the wells, but one of the many things that our technical team has learned, especially after drilling and analyzing the early data from these expansion wells, coupled with our analyses of the existing producing fields in the more than 50 vertical tests throughout the acreage, is that the Lower Cotton Valley sands in this portion of the basin are fairly consistent given us support for our optimism. Even so, this does not take into account the other 2 to 3 horizontal targets available throughout the acreage. 
Shifting back to the Terryville field. Both red zones and both pink zones have been tested to date, along with further development in the Upper Red, which has been the primary target. We'll also be looking at the lower red and the deep pink going forward. We see a lot of value in the stack development and combined with lower cost are encouraged by the future potential in Terryville, along with the extension areas. 
For 2017, [indiscernible] we'll end the year with approximately 25 [ph] drilled and uncompleted wellbores in North Louisiana, which we plan to complete in the first quarter. This will result in outsized production early next year into what we think will be a stronger pricing environment. As we smooth out the completion activity going forward, I believe we'll have a Range-like approach of steady quarter-over-quarter growth in North Louisiana as we enter 2018. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. In addition to improving netbacks and the updates that Jeff discussed during his remarks, I'd like to re-emphasize a couple of points before I close. There have been a lot of questions about pipeline projects in Appalachia, are they on time and what impacts might they have on basis and so forth. Remember that Range was the first mover in the basin, and we've been working on a diversified and layered portfolio of transportation for many years. As Jeff discussed, we believe the projects that we are in our on time. We sell to multiple markets and have been consistent in our strategy since we discovered the Marcellus. One pipe doesn't make a big difference to Range as we're diversified -- as we diversified exposure over multiple pipes. 
Our 2017 natural gas differential is expected to improve by $0.10 to $0.15 based on current strip pricing, and our pricing is a much more resilient having multiple outlets in a large base of North Louisiana production. 
Again, we just acquired a world-class asset in North Louisiana that gets very close to NYMEX pricing and provides marketing and capital flexibility. So now one pipe makes even less difference. 
We set capital budgets at the beginning of every year. The capital is allocated on a realtime basis. Having 2 of the most economic plays in the U.S. is a unique advantage, and we have the flexibility to allocate capital realtime as conditions dictate. None of our peers in Appalachia have this option. 
As both our Southern Marcellus and North Louisiana divisions continue to improve on costs, efficiencies and performance, we expect there will be a lot of value as markets improve. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger."
93030,403867219,1061340,"Range Resources Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million, that's 36% higher than the second quarte",1020,"Thank you, Ray. I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million, that's 36% higher than the second quarter of this year. 
Cash flow at $123 million was 32% higher. EBITDAX at $160 [ph] million was 24% higher and cash margin at $0.82 was 17% [ph] higher. [indiscernible] navigated this period of low commodity prices well. And by all measures, the third quarter of 2016 appears to mark a financial turning point for Range. 
Given that the third quarter includes only 15 days of operating results from Memorial merger, we're excited that we have not only turned the proverbial corner, but are now moving forward on a wider, unique and more prosperous new route. The reasons for optimism and confidence in the Range's past are multi-fold. We have attractive new optionality when deploying capital, production continues to steadily grow, the cost structure continues to improve and the higher-margin marketing and transportation arrangements we've spoken of in prior quarters are now fully operational, delivering improved cash flow and margins we predicted. 
Year-to-date cash flow was $316 [ph] million, and year-to-date EBITDAX docs was $424 million. Fully diluted cash flow per share [indiscernible], which, again, includes only 15 days of cash flow from Memorial merger, was $0.68 [ph] per share. 
Looking closer at the third quarter cost structure performance, the Range teams have continued to do a terrific job holding a line on cash direct operating expense, which is $0.16 [ph] per Mcfe, was roughly the same as last quarter and a 38% improvement from the third quarter of last year. 
All of the unit cost items came in at unfavorable [ph] guidance with the exception of interest expense, which was $0.04 over guidance due to nonrecurring transaction expenses associated with a successful senior subordinated note exchange, which I'll further discuss in a moment. 
The third quarter DD&A rate was $0.95 per Mcfe, identical to the prior quarter, and 18% better than the third quarter of last year. 
And please reference the third quarter earnings release for full fourth [ph] quarter 2016 unit cost expense guidance. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Investors will note many positive changes resulting for Memorial merger. The third quarter debt-to-capitalization ratio improved from 49% at year-end 2015 to 41% at the end of the third quarter. Debt to rolling 4 quarter EBITDAX, including the Memorial debt and historical 4 quarters of their EBITDAX was 3.6x. The combined Range and Memorial balance sheet limit our debt to EBITDAX leverage to the mid-3x Range with the ratio getting better next year as higher cumulative cash flow improves the ratio moving into 2018. 
By the end of 2018, We expect that debt to EBITDAX ratio to have declined at least a full turn from continued growth at/or near cash flow. 
Our forward-looking recycle ratio remains above the 2x level as NYMEX prices have further strengthened in our marketing contracting North Louisiana production, allow us to move more of our products higher-margin sales points. 
The Memorial merger also provided an excellent opportunity to further advance our balance sheet structure. Premerger, Memorial had a partially funded fully conforming $1 billion bank credit facility and $600 million in unsecured senior notes outstanding. 
Premerger, Range had a $3 billion bank credit facility with only $3 million outstanding against its $2 billion commitment amount. 
Range also had one issue of unsecured senior notes outstanding and 3 series of unsecured subordinated notes. The merger allowed Range to resimplified the company's debt structure into a single bank credit facility and a single tier of unsecured senior notes through a comprehensive bond exchange and tender offer. And here's briefly how it worked. The Memorial bank credit facility was canceled at merger close, the collateral was released and the outstanding balance was moved to the existing Range bank credit facility. Over 97% of the 3 series of Range of subordinated notes were exchanged for like rate and like maturity Range senior notes and the Memorial senior notes were exchanged into like kind Range senior notes or reading for cash at the holders option, with the majority of the Memorial senior note holders choosing to accept Range notes rather than cash. 
The exchange was very successful. The Range subordinated notes are now senior notes. The Range in all Memorial senior notes are now all [indiscernible] Range senior obligations and share the same covenant package as the Range existing 2025 senior notes. This allows bond investors to trade freely across the entire rate maturity spectrum without making structural credit adjustments due to price. 
The exchange allowed Range to utilize some of our low costs unused to back commitment, while still providing close to $1 billion in committed liquidity. Following the exchange, all of the Range bonds traded at tighter spreads and before the exchange in both Moody's and S&P move Range to stable outlook. While Range is not yet investment-grade, the bond exchange aligns our balance sheet closer to what is expected of an investment-grade company. My confidence to the Range finance team for completing this complex and highly successful series of transactions, which makes our balance sheet even easier to understand and positions us well for future growth in credit quality improvement. 
The Range hedge position was significantly enhanced by the Memorial merger, with the post-merger hedge book holding higher hedge natural gas volumes and prices. Range also added hedge volumes across all of our products during the third quarter. And please reference the earnings release third quarter 10-Q and Range website for specific post-merger hedge volume and price information. 
In summary, the third quarter showed the fundamental improvements in top line revenue, cash flow and margins flowing through the Range financial statements that we have all worked so hard to achieve. With the financial statements reflecting only 15 days of Memorial ownership and the exciting results Range has discussed in both Appalachia and North Louisiana, we look forward to continued operating and financial progress in the quarters ahead. 
Jeff, back to you."

Again, I think it's a great question and a really important one because it highlights our ability to choose between 2 great assets each near key market areas in the Northeast and in the Gulf Coast. Both areas we have the ability to ramp production and are expected to get good growth next year relative to '16, and we can do that for a long time into the future. Another key thing, I think, that's kind of a unique ability we have to react to upcoming changes in capital allocation, in my opinion, is a rate advantage at Range has that other companies don't have or a lot of our peers don't have. So is a function of several things. We run multiple scenarios. And you're right, Arun, we think as we continue to grow and ran volumes, which we expect to do in North Louisiana that that cost that you mentioned will come down significantly with time we can really drive down the processing and gathering costs."

With the infrastructure in place, of course, when you go back on to existing pad, you don't have to build a pad, the road, meter tops, production facilities, the water infrastructure, all of that stuff is already there. And you can see savings on a per well basis ranging from $200,000 up to, I mean, there's one example in our presentation, for example, that's $850,000. And they're not all going to be $850,000, they're not all going to be $200,000. I think every case is going to be specific. But as we roll into '17, and we see as much as 1/3 of our wells potentially next year in our current intensity, which, of course, will change, but when we look at it today, we see maybe 1/3 of our wells next year own existing pads, that could move as high as half of our wells potentially in '18. And I think over time, you're going to see some major improvements to capital efficiency. But if you try to get back to well-by-well basis somewhere between that $200,000 to $400,000, $500,000 per well on average, something like that."

I think contracts is a term that gets a way over used when talking about service companies because every contracts are different and has different outs and different resets and everything else that people put in there.

And in fact, there's an example in the presentation that has got about 2 -- over 2 years of production history on it, and it was a pad that we went on to 5-well pad and put 2 additional wells on it, and we were wanting to answer 3 questions. One, how much money did we actually save? Number two, did the wells interfere with the existing wells that were already there? And then number three, since we were going onto a pad that is already 2 years old, with a better targeting and a better completion designs, in other words, 2 more years of learnings would that really helped the completion and the answer was as presented on that slide, we saved $850,000 per well, which is huge. The wells did not impact the existing target. And literally, the new wells were literally only targeted about 20 or 30 feet different from the original well. So even in the same zone, which is only about 80 or 90 feet thick in that area, we were only about 20 feet apart in difference and we were 700 feet between wells, so we did not impact the existing wells. So that's was a huge learning for us. And we've repeated that several times since. And then the third thing is the wells after 2 years of production were 53% [ph] better producers than the original wells. So you can start to imagine if you just go through that hundreds of times going forward in the future, you can start seeing what sort of capital efficiencies you could bake in to that. And it's pretty impressive. So we've literally got a lot of that to do. I think a year or so ago, we were about 10% on existing pads. This year, I think we're probably less than that, hardly any on existing pads. Another important thing that's happened this year is we have all our HBP concerns are finished. So literally, we have no more acreage at risk, and so we no longer have to worry about that aspect, which allows us to going forward really focus our capital in the very best returns, and that's what you're going to see us doing going forward. And I think you'll see those numbers gradually increase. I don't think it'll ever be 100% because clearly, we've got some really good areas like in the eastern part of Washington County in our dry acreage we're even address reach brand-new 4-well pad there has even gotten better economics than going back onto existing to super-rich pad. So I think it allows us realtime to allocate capital through various best projects in the Marcellus and  then now, of course, we've got another WordPress assets, North Louisiana, and gives us another great option."

We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcel",1236,"Thank you, Laith. We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcellus Shale division and the new North Louisiana division. 
I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the quarter and then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that I believe set us up for success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in solid operating results for the third quarter and due to the closing date, 15 days of solid performance from the North Louisiana team were represented in the quarterly numbers. 
The third quarter took us one step closer to seeing meaningful improvements in realized prices across all of our products. First, all 3 of our liquids projects were online during the quarter, ATEX, Mariner West and Mariner East. We sold ethane to Europe, Canada and to the Gulf Coast and exported propane from Marcus Hook in international markets. The net effect is that our NGL price increase from 13% of WTI to 25% of WTI on a year-over-year basis. 
Second, we have a new condensate sales agreements, which commenced on July 1. These agreements approved our corporate condensate realizations from a $13 differential to WTI to a $6 differential to WTI on a year-over-year basis and the similar improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Third, NYMEX gas prices were higher in the third quarter and all of the gas pipelines we are contracted on are expected to be on schedule. This includes Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion, which came online earlier this month on October 4. This transportation allows us to move in additional 150 million per day of all Marcellus production to the Gulf Coast. 
Like the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, which became operational this time last year, this project immediately improves our expected Marcellus netbacks. The next 2 projects for Range are Colombia's Leach/Rayne XPress and ATP's Rover Phase II, both of which have received first final EIS approval and both of which we understand will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
As a result of this increased transport in our growing North Louisiana production, we expect to see corporate natural gas differentials improving to approximately $0.46 next quarter based on current's strip pricing and approximately $0.33 in 2017. All else being equal, these improved netbacks should improve margins substantially in 2017, and we expect further improvements in 2018. 
Let me turn to North Louisiana and give an update there. The integration, as I mentioned earlier, is going very well and the North Louisiana division is accomplishing a lot. Let me give a few examples. 
First, we just set a record for the fastest spud to rig release of any well drilled to date in Terryville field and then repeated that record with the second well. In addition, we just completed one of the best producing wells ever drilled in the field to date. Our Purchasing Department has also made good progress, and we're achieving cost reductions on that front as a result. Ray will talk more specifically about these accomplishments and improvements in a few minutes. 
The North Louisiana team has also had some early success refining the targeting and landing in the Lower Cotton Valley. As an example, they just finished drilling some wells that were entirely within a much tighter target within the Upper Red. Once we complete the wells, we'll see what effect this has on performance. 
It's early, but we're also excited about the North Louisiana extension areas. The team has drilled the pilot holes for the first 3 extension wells, all testing new areas several miles away from Terryville and far away from each other. 
Based on extensive logs, courts and shows, all 3 vertical pilots look very encouraging. In addition, we have drilled in case the horizontal laterals on 2 of the 3 pilot holes. Again, the results to date look encouraging. 
The third lateral is currently being drilled. We expect to have all 3 wells drilled, completed and tested by the end of this year. The results of the will help provide additional data regarding the extension areas that will be rolled into our planning for 2017 and 2018. 
On a macro level, there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of the year. 
Based on available data, it appears 2016 will be the first time that natural gas production will decline on a year-over-year basis since 2005. This supply decline is happening, while demand for natural gas is increasing, driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking towards 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3, and we think it can continue to climb. 
Based on where strip pricing is today, we believe that we can grow the combined company at 33% to 35% for 2017. This equates to an organic growth rate of 11% to 13% for 2017, coupled with the full year of the North Louisiana division versus roughly a quarter in 2016. 
Importantly, this preliminary plan for 2017 also results in strong growth for 2018. Assuming a $3.25 per mcf and $60 per barrel, we are projecting that we should achieve organic growth for 2018 of approximately 20%. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Lower Cotton Valley assets are 2 of the lowest-cost gas plays in the United States, which resulted in a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. This combination creates a unique portfolio that is strategically located near key demand centers with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. 
The product mix in both assets are similar, which enabled us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. 
In summary, we believe that Range offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is a very high quality low-cost asset base in 2 very supplementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. 
Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also are drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. 
The third key attribute is top tier operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. 
The fourth is a strong marketing effort highlighted by the Range's ability to sell its products to into multiple markets enhanced by nearly acquired North Louisiana assets and demonstrated and are expecting pricing improvements across all products heading into the fourth quarter of 2016 and further into 2017. 
Finally, Range has an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."
93030,403867219,1061947,"Range Resources Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf eq",2376,"Thanks, Jeff. We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Excluding the asset sales and the North Louisiana volumes, we expect to grow 10% over last year as previously guided, while maintaining our capital expenditure level at approximately $495 million. And importantly, we plan to end 2016 with an exit rate higher than last year, setting us up well for 2017 and beyond. 
We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and this is something that we're really proud of. Specifically, driving this improvement in the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 35% reduction in LOE year-to-date versus the average for 2015. This was achieved through 3 key areas. One, leveraging service cost with our long-term vendor relationships; two, reductions in third-party manpower; and three, the savings associated with our water handling through our water logistics team, which gets water from our production pads to our frac operation quicker than ever. 
Staying with our Marcellus activity, capital efficiency continues to improve. And I'll review some examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
On the water front, we've continued the improvements that we discussed on the last call and we'll reduce our capital expenditures for water by over $20 million this year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 20% as compared to last year. 
Our top 3 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.5 stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 23% below the average, which, again, was already 20% lower than last year. 
We're forecasting a 16% reduction in CapEx for production facilities resulting in almost $6 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and material and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we've achieved a 5% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, and 8 of our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day have been this year. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward. 
As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. Again, all of this being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages in our wet area with full facilities on a new build full well pad for approximately $7.2 million per well. 
In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. In fact over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics. 
I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. Like I reported on the last call, we are now drilling a 7-well pad in our super-rich area averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells during the third quarter, but before I do that, I want to remind everyone that these rates will all be reported as constrained actual rates to sales. 
In our dry area, a 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 5,300 feet in 28 stages per well was completed and had an average 24-hour rate to sales of 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day. 
In our wet area, 2 pads showed excellent results. A 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 6,800 feet in 35 stages produced at 22 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and a 6-well pad with an average lateral length of 4,500 feet and 23 stages produced at $19 million a day per well. 
On the last couple of calls, we've also discussed our unique advantage of the expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at lower cost, thereby increasing capital efficiencies, while allowing us to ramp up quicker than any of our peers. 
Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals at very attractive cost. 
Although it's early in the planning process, in Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about 1/3 of our wells on existing pads in 2017. That number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is planned to be over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that 2018 average lateral length will be longer. Again, these are early estimates and will most certainly change over time. 
What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads, and we have permits at hand with infrastructure in place to yield further improving capital efficiencies going forward. 
Shifting now to North Louisiana. The integration is going very well. We'll be operating those assets out of our new North Louisiana division office in Houston under the direction of John Applegath, Senior Vice President of the new North Louisiana division, who has relocated there to Houston from our Southern Marcellus division office in Pittsburgh. 
Dennis Degner, now Vice President of the Southern Marcellus division, stepped up to take over the Southern Marcellus shale division. We are extremely proud of both of these gentlemen and their accomplishments. The record is clear. And through their leadership, we expect continued improvements in capital efficiency, coupled with improving well performance in both areas. 
When we originally evaluated the Memorial assets, our expectations were that we can improve over the already impressive results they had seen there. For example, we felt there was potential in terms of drilling times and costs, coupled with improvements in well performance by optimizing the target window and staying in zone, all of which, which should result in improved efficiencies and productivity over time. 
Even though we've only had the Range for approximately 6 weeks, as Jeff referred to in his remarks, John and the new team are already achieving some significant wins. We just set the record for spud to rig release in Terryville of 30 days and have now repeated it on the second well. To date, this year, the wells averaging more than 5,000 feet of lateral length, the average has been 40 days. This 25% improvement in efficiency was achieved by implementing more aggressive bps and high-speed, high-differential motors. 
A lot of these ideas and many more coming are the result of the spring and then Scott Chesebro [ph] as our new Vice President of drilling. Scott has a ton of experience in high-pressure high-temperature drilling across the world and was actually involved in the vertical drilling in the Vernon Field. We expect Scott and his new team will be able to significantly improve drilling performance and cost as we go forward. 
In the last batch of wells that were completed, we also saw one of the highest productive wells in Terryville to date. It had a 30-day IP to sales of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day per 1,000 foot or over 27 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is 68% higher than the average. 
We believe this is a real testament to both the team and the quality of the rock in Terryville and clearly illustrates that there is more potential yet to be unlocked as we further develop the Upper Red, along with the stack pay opportunities in Terryville field. 
Like I said many times over the years in the Marcellus, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet in Terryville. 
We've also had a quick win on targeting. When drilling in the Upper Red prior to Range, the target for the lateral ranged from 100 to 125 feet thick, encompassing most of the reservoir. We believe there may be significant performance improvements by incorporating an approach where we target only the best across the interval, which is 20 to 40 feet thick, and then staying that much smaller target window for 100% of the lateral. We've already accomplished this on a few wells and expect to announce those results next year when those wells are completed. 
Bringing the bear to supply chain advantages of Range has also resulted in an early win. For example, we've already saved 7% in casing cost resulting in savings of over $50,000 per well, and we expect that there will be many examples of this going forward. 
As illustrated in these few early examples, we believe strongly that we can lower cost, improve well performance, improve operational efficiencies and lower our unit cost, while working safely and being good stewards of the environment and the communities where we live in the. We will be bring to bear our operating philosophy of steady and strategic planning, implementing innovative and sound technology -- technologies and processes that have worked for us in the Marcellus while putting in place a long-term approach focused on economic and value enhancing growth. 
Like Jeff mentioned, we're currently working on the 3 extension areas of wells. 2 of the wells are in the completion phase and the third well is nearing completion of the drilling phase. We expect to be able to have initial results from these 3 wells before year-end. 
Looking at the data collected thus far, the Upper Red sands in these wells have an average gas in place concentration, that is Bcf per vertical foot that is on par with the Upper Red in the very best part of Terryville, and they're twice as thick, yielding twice the gas in place as the Upper Red sands in Terryville. The Lower Red sands have an average gas in place concentration nearly 3x that of the best Lower Red in Terryville. Considering these wells are deeper and have a high year pressure gradient, we interpret the higher reservoir pressure, better gas in place and the favorable reservoir parameters to be cause for optimism regarding these areas in the basin. 
Of course, we won't know for sure until we see the actual production from the wells, but one of the many things that our technical team has learned, especially after drilling and analyzing the early data from these expansion wells, coupled with our analyses of the existing producing fields in the more than 50 vertical tests throughout the acreage, is that the Lower Cotton Valley sands in this portion of the basin are fairly consistent given us support for our optimism. Even so, this does not take into account the other 2 to 3 horizontal targets available throughout the acreage. 
Shifting back to the Terryville field. Both red zones and both pink zones have been tested to date, along with further development in the Upper Red, which has been the primary target. We'll also be looking at the lower red and the deep pink going forward. We see a lot of value in the stacked pay development and combined with lower cost are encouraged about the future potential in Terryville, along with the extension areas. 
For 2017, we'll enter the year with approximately 25 drilled and uncompleted wellbores in North Louisiana, which we plan to complete in the first quarter. This will result in outsized production growth early next year into what we think will be a stronger pricing environment. As we smooth out the completion activity going forward, I believe we'll have a Range-like approach of steady quarter-over-quarter growth in North Louisiana as we enter 2018. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. In addition to improving netbacks and the updates that Jeff discussed during his remarks, I'd like to re-emphasize a couple of points before I close. There have been a lot of questions about pipeline projects in Appalachia, are they on time? and what impacts might they have on basis? and so forth. Remember that Range was the first mover in the basin, and we've been working on a diversified and layered portfolio of transportation for many years. As Jeff discussed, we believe the projects that we are in our on time. We sell to multiple markets and have been consistent in our strategy since we discovered the Marcellus. One pipe doesn't make a big difference to Range as we're diversified -- as we diversified our exposure over multiple pipes. 
Our 2017 natural gas differential is expected to improve by $0.10 to $0.15 based on current strip pricing, and our pricing is a much more resilient having multiple outlets in a large base of North Louisiana production. 
Again, we just acquired a world-class asset in North Louisiana that gets very close to NYMEX pricing and provides marketing and capital flexibility. So now one pipe makes even less difference. 
We set capital budgets at the beginning of every year. The capital is allocated on a realtime basis. Having 2 of the most economic plays in the U.S. is a unique advantage, and we have the flexibility to allocate capital realtime as conditions dictate. None of our peers in Appalachia have this option. 
As both our Southern Marcellus and North Louisiana divisions continue to improve on costs, efficiencies and performance, we expect there will be a lot of value as markets improve. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger."

I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million, that's 36% higher than the second quarte",1014,"Thank you, Ray. I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million, that's 36% higher than the second quarter of this year. 
Cash flow at $123 million was 32% higher. EBITDAX at $160 million was 24% higher and cash margin at $0.82 was 17% higher. Range has navigated this period of low commodity prices well. And by all measures, the third quarter of 2016 appears to mark a financial turning point for Range. 
Given that the third quarter includes only 15 days of operating results from Memorial merger, we're excited that we have not only turned the proverbial corner, but are now moving forward on a wider, unique and more prosperous new road. The reasons for optimism and confidence in the Range's past are multi-fold. We have attractive new optionality when deploying capital, production continues to steadily grow, the cost structure continues to improve and the higher-margin marketing and transportation arrangements we've spoken of in prior quarters are now fully operational, delivering the improved cash flow and margins we predicted. 
Year-to-date cash flow was $316 million, and year-to-date EBITDAX was $424 million. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the quarter which, again, includes only 15 days of cash flow from Memorial merger, was $0.68 per share. 
Looking closer at the third quarter cost structure performance, the Range teams have continued to do a terrific job holding a line on cash direct operating expense, which is $0.16 per Mcfe, was roughly the same as last quarter and a 38% improvement from the third quarter of last year. 
All of the unit cost items came in at/or favorable to guidance with the exception of interest expense, which was $0.04 over guidance due to nonrecurring transaction expenses associated with a successful senior subordinated note exchange, which I'll further discuss in a moment. 
The third quarter DD&A rate was $0.95 per Mcfe, identical to the prior quarter, and 18% better than the third quarter of last year. 
And please reference the third quarter earnings release for full fourth quarter 2016 unit cost expense guidance. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Investors will note many positive changes resulting from the Memorial merger. The third quarter debt-to-capitalization ratio improved from 49% at year-end 2015 to 41% at the end of the third quarter. Debt-to-rolling 4 quarter EBITDAX, including the Memorial debt and historical 4 quarters of their EBITDAX was 3.6x. The combined Range and Memorial balance sheet limit our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage to the mid-3x Range with the ratio getting better next year as higher cumulative cash flow improves the ratio moving into 2018. 
By the end of 2018, We expect the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio to have declined at least a full turn from continued growth at/or near cash flow. 
Our forward-looking recycle ratio remains above the 2x level as NYMEX prices have further strengthened in our marketing contracts at North Louisiana production, allow us to move more of our products higher-margin sales points. 
The Memorial merger also provided an excellent opportunity to further advance our balance sheet structure. Premerger, Memorial had a partially funded fully conforming $1 billion bank credit facility and $600 million in unsecured senior notes outstanding. 
Premerger, Range had a $3 billion bank credit facility with only $3 million outstanding against its $2 billion commitment amount. 
Range also had one issue of unsecured senior notes outstanding and 3 series of unsecured subordinated notes. The merger allowed Range to re-simplify the company's debt structure into a single bank credit facility and a single tier of unsecured senior notes through a comprehensive bond exchange and tender offer. And here's briefly how it worked. The Memorial bank credit facility was canceled at merger close, the collateral was released and the outstanding balance was moved to the existing Range bank credit facility. Over 97% of the 3 series of Range subordinated notes were exchanged for like rate and like maturity Range senior notes and the Memorial senior notes were exchanged into like kind Range senior notes or redeemed for cash at the holders option, with the majority of the Memorial senior note holders choosing to accept Range notes rather than cash. 
The exchange was very successful. The Range subordinated notes are now senior notes. The Range in old Memorial senior notes are now all pari passu Range senior obligations and share the same covenant package as the Range existing 2025 senior notes. This allows bond investors to trade freely across the entire rate and maturity spectrum without making structural credit adjustments due to price. 
The exchange allowed Range to utilize some of our low costs unused to back commitment, while still providing close to $1 billion in committed liquidity. Following the exchange, all of the Range bonds traded at tighter spreads than before the exchange in both Moody's and S&P moved Range to stable outlook. While Range is not yet investment-grade, the bond exchange aligns our balance sheet closer to what is expected of an investment-grade company. My compliments to the Range finance team for completing this complex and highly successful series of transactions, which makes our balance sheet even easier to understand and positions us well for future growth in credit quality improvement. 
The Range hedge position was significantly enhanced by the Memorial merger, with the post-merger hedge book holding higher hedge natural gas volumes and prices. Range also added hedge volumes across all of our products during the third quarter. And please reference the earnings release third quarter 10-Q and Range website for specific post-merger hedge volume and price information. 
In summary, the third quarter showed the fundamental improvements in top line revenue, cash flow and margins flowing through the Range financial statements that we have all worked so hard to achieve. With the financial statements reflecting only 15 days of Memorial ownership and the exciting results Range has discussed in both Appalachia and North Louisiana, we look forward to continued operating and financial progress in the quarters ahead. 
Jeff, back to you."

Again, I think it's a great question and a really important one because it highlights our ability to choose between 2 great assets each near key market areas in the Northeast and in the Gulf Coast. Both areas we have the ability to ramp production and are expected to get good growth next year relative to '16, and we can do that for a long time into the future. Another key thing, I think, that's kind of a unique ability we have to react to upcoming changes in capital allocation, in my opinion, is a real advantage that Range has that other companies don't have or a lot of our peers don't have. So it's a function of several things. We run multiple scenarios. And you're right, Arun, we think as we continue to grow and ran volumes, which we expect to do in North Louisiana that cost that you mentioned will come down significantly with time we can really drive down the processing and gathering costs."

With the infrastructure in place, of course, when you go back on to existing pad, you don't have to build a pad, the road, meter taps, production facilities, the water infrastructure, all of that stuff is already there.

And they're not all going to be $850,000, they're not all going to be $200,000. I think every case is going to be specific. But as we roll into '17, and we see as much as 1/3 of our wells potentially next year in our current plans today, which, of course, will change, but when we look at it today, we see maybe 1/3 of our wells next year on existing pads, that could move to as high as half of our wells potentially in '18.

And clearly, we are at/or near bottom, we think, in service prices, and I don't think anybody would disagree with that. I think that the way prices on the service and supply side move from this point forward depends on that -- it's going to be very regional, I'd say it that way. I think in areas potentially like West Texas and maybe the scoop stack areas in places like that where activity seems to have ramped up quite a bit more. You can see prices moving up. In the Marcellus per se, we don't see it. We are entering into what we term long-term relationships, not necessarily contracts. I think contracts is a term that gets a way over used when talking about service companies because every contract is different and has different outs and different resets and everything else that people put in there. But we focus a lot on long-term relationships, and we don't see any important or significant. Price increases going onto '17. It's a little hard to see pass that yet because I think a lot of it depends on commodity prices and what we see there. And we're pretty excited about the future going forward. We've got 2 great plays. We can allocate capital freely back and forth between the 2 plays. We have organizations and opportunities in place to significantly ramp up both sides of that. And so I think that we have a ton of really high class opportunities going forward. And I think we're going to be well positioned to adjust to whatever happens on the service side."

And in fact, there's an example in the presentation that has got about 2 -- over 2 years of production history on it, and it was a pad that we went on to 5-well pad and put 2 additional wells on it, and we were wanting to answer 3 questions. One, how much money did we actually save? #2, did the wells interfere with the existing wells that were already there? And then #3, since we were going onto a pad that was already 2 years old, with a better targeting and a better completion designs, in other words, 2 more years of learnings would that really helped the completion and the answer was as presented on that slide, we saved $850,000 per well, which is huge. The wells did not impact the existing target. And literally, the new wells were literally only targeted about 20 or 30 feet different from the original well. So even in the same zone, which is only about 80 or 90 feet thick in that area, we were only about 20 feet apart in difference and we were 700 feet between wells, so we did not impact the existing wells. So that's was a huge learning for us. And we've repeated that several times since. And then the third thing is the wells after 2 years of production were 53% better producers than the original wells. So you can start to imagine if you just go through that hundreds of times going forward in the future, you can start seeing what sort of capital efficiencies you could bake in to that. And it's pretty impressive. So we've literally got a lot of that to do. I think a year or so ago, we were about 10% on existing pads. This year, I think we're probably less than that, hardly any on existing pads. Another important thing that's happened this year is we have all our HBP concerns are finished. So literally, we have no more acreage at risk, and so we no longer have to worry about that aspect, which allows us to going forward really focus our capital in the very best returns, and that's what you're going to see us doing going forward. And I think you'll see those numbers gradually increase. I don't think it'll ever be 100% because clearly, we've got some really good areas like in the eastern part of Washington County in our dry acreage we're even at grass rich brand-new 4-well pad there has even got better economics than going back onto an existing wet or super-rich pad. So I think it allows us realtime to allocate capital to the various best projects in the Marcellus and  then now, of course, we've got another world class asset, North Louisiana, and that gives us another great option."

We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcel",1237,"Thank you, Laith. We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcellus Shale division and the new North Louisiana division. 
I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the quarter and then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that I believe set us up for success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in solid operating results for the third quarter, and due to the closing date, 15 days of solid performance from the North Louisiana team were represented in the quarterly numbers. 
The third quarter took us one step closer to seeing meaningful improvements in realized prices across all of our products. First, all 3 of our liquids projects were online during the quarter: ATEX, Mariner West and Mariner East. We sold ethane to Europe, Canada and to the Gulf Coast and exported propane from Marcus Hook in international markets. The net effect is that our NGL price increased from 13% of WTI to 25% of WTI on a year-over-year basis. 
Second, we have a new condensate sales agreements, which commenced on July 1. These agreements approved our corporate condensate realizations from a $13 differential to WTI to a $6 differential to WTI on a year-over-year basis in a similar improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Third, NYMEX gas prices were higher in the third quarter, and all of the gas pipelines we are contracted on are expected to be on schedule. This includes Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion, which came online earlier this month on October 4. This transportation allows us to move an additional 150 million per day of all Marcellus production to the Gulf Coast. 
Like the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, which became operational this time last year, this project immediately improves our expected Marcellus netbacks. The next 2 projects for Range are Colombia's Leach/Rayne XPress and ATP's Rover Phase II, both of which have received first final EIS approval and both of which we understand will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
As a result of this increased transport in our growing North Louisiana production, we expect to see corporate natural gas differentials improving to approximately $0.46 next quarter based on current strip pricing, and approximately $0.33 in 2017. All else being equal, these improved netbacks should improve margins substantially in 2017, and we expect further improvements in 2018. 
Let me turn to North Louisiana and give an update there. The integration, as I mentioned earlier, is going very well, and the North Louisiana division is accomplishing a lot. Let me give a few examples. 
First, we just set a record for the fastest spud to rig release of any well drilled to date in Terryville field and then repeated that record with the second well. In addition, we just completed one of the best producing wells ever drilled in the field to date. Our Purchasing Department has also made good progress, and we're achieving cost reductions on that front as a result. Ray will talk more specifically about these accomplishments and improvements in a few minutes. 
The North Louisiana team has also had some early success refining the targeting and landing in the Lower Cotton Valley. As an example, they just finished drilling some wells that were entirely within a much tighter target within the Upper Red. Once we complete the wells, we'll see what effect this has on performance. 
It's early, but we're also excited about the North Louisiana extension areas. The team has drilled the pilot holes for the first 3 extension wells, all testing new areas several miles away from Terryville and far away from each other. 
Based on extensive logs, courts and shows, all 3 vertical pilots look very encouraging. In addition, we have drilled in case the horizontal laterals on 2 of the 3 pilot holes. Again, the results to date look encouraging. 
The third lateral is currently being drilled. We expect to have all 3 wells drilled, completed and tested by the end of this year. The results of the wells will help provide additional data regarding the extension areas that will be rolled into our planning for 2017 and 2018. 
On a macro level, there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of the year. 
Based on available data, it appears 2016 will be the first time that natural gas production will decline on a year-over-year basis since 2005. This supply decline is happening, while demand for natural gas is increasing, driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking towards 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3, and we think it can continue to climb. 
Based on where strip pricing is today, we believe that we can grow the combined company at 33% to 35% for 2017. This equates to an organic growth rate of 11% to 13% for 2017, coupled with the full year of the North Louisiana division versus roughly a quarter in 2016. 
Importantly, this preliminary plan for 2017 also results in strong growth for 2018. Assuming a $3.25 per mcf and $60 per barrel, we are projecting that we should achieve organic growth for 2018 of approximately 20%. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Lower Cotton Valley assets are 2 of the lowest-cost gas plays in the United States, which resulted in a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. This combination creates a unique portfolio that is strategically located near key demand centers with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. 
The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. 
In summary, we believe that Range offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is a very high quality low-cost asset base in 2 very supplementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. 
Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also are drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. 
The third key attribute is top-tier operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. 
The fourth is a strong marketing effort highlighted by the Range's ability to sell its products to into multiple markets, enhanced by our nearly acquired North Louisiana assets and demonstrated in our expecting pricing improvements across all products heading into the fourth quarter of 2016 and further into 2017. 
Finally, Range has an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf eq",2370,"Thanks, Jeff. We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Excluding the asset sales and the North Louisiana volumes, we expect to grow 10% over last year as previously guided, while maintaining our capital expenditure level at approximately $495 million. And importantly, we plan to end 2016 with an exit rate higher than last year, setting us up well for 2017 and beyond. 
We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and this is something that we're really proud of. Specifically, driving this improvement in the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 35% reduction in LOE year-to-date versus the average for 2015. This was achieved through 3 key areas. One, leveraging service cost with our long-term vendor relationships; two, reductions in third-party manpower; and three, the savings associated with our water handling through our water logistics team, which gets water from our production pads to our frac operation quicker than ever. 
Staying with our Marcellus activity, capital efficiency continues to improve. And I'll review some examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
On the water front, we've continued the improvements that we discussed on the last call, and we'll reduce our capital expenditures for water by over $20 million this year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 20% as compared to last year. 
Our top 3 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.5 stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 23% below the average, which, again, was already 20% lower than last year. 
We're forecasting a 16% reduction in CapEx for production facilities resulting in almost $6 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and material, and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we've achieved a 5% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, and 8 of our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day have been this year. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward. 
As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. Again, all of this being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages in our wet area with full facilities on a new build full well pad for approximately $7.2 million per well. 
In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. In fact over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics. 
I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. Like I reported on the last call, we are now drilling a 7-well pad in our super-rich area averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells during the third quarter, but before I do that, I want to remind everyone that these rates will all be reported as constrained actual rates to sales. 
In our dry area, a 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 5,300 feet in 28 stages per well was completed and had an average 24-hour rate to sales of 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day. 
In our wet area, 2 pads showed excellent results. A 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 6,800 feet in 35 stages produced at 22 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and a 6-well pad with an average lateral length of 4,500 feet and 23 stages produced at $19 million a day per well. 
On the last couple of calls, we've also discussed our unique advantage of the expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at lower cost, thereby increasing capital efficiencies, while allowing us to ramp up quicker than any of our peers. 
Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells, and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals at very attractive cost. 
Although it's early in the planning process, in Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about 1/3 of our wells on existing pads in 2017. That number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is planned to be over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that 2018 average lateral length will be longer. Again, these are early estimates and will most certainly change over time. 
What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads, and we have permits at hand with infrastructure in place to yield further improving capital efficiencies going forward. 
Shifting now to North Louisiana. The integration is going very well. We'll be operating those assets out of our new North Louisiana division office in Houston under the direction of John Applegath, Senior Vice President of the new North Louisiana division, who has relocated there to Houston from our Southern Marcellus division office in Pittsburgh. 
Dennis Degner, now Vice President of the Southern Marcellus division, stepped up to take over the Southern Marcellus shale division. We are extremely proud of both of these gentlemen and their accomplishments. The record is clear. And through their leadership, we expect continued improvements in capital efficiency, coupled with improving well performance in both areas. 
When we originally evaluated the Memorial assets, our expectations were that we can improve over the already impressive results they had seen there. For example, we felt there was potential in terms of drilling times and costs, coupled with improvements in well performance by optimizing the target window and staying in zone, all of which, which should result in improved efficiencies and productivity over time. 
Even though we've only had the Range for approximately 6 weeks, as Jeff referred to in his remarks, John and the new team are already achieving some significant wins. We just set the record for spud to rig release in Terryville of 30 days and have now repeated it on the second well. To date, this year, the well's averaging more than 5,000 feet of lateral length, the average has been 40 days. This 25% improvement in efficiency was achieved by implementing more aggressive bps and high-speed, high-differential motors. 
A lot of these ideas and many more coming are the result of us bringing in Scott Chesebrough as our new Vice President of drilling. Scott has a ton of experience in high-pressure high-temperature drilling across the world and was actually involved in the vertical drilling in the Vernon Field. We expect Scott and his new team will be able to significantly improve drilling performance and cost as we go forward. 
In the last batch of wells that were completed, we also saw one of the highest productive wells in Terryville to date. It had a 30-day IP to sales of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day per 1,000 foot or over 27 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is 68% higher than the average. 
We believe this is a real testament to both the team and the quality of the rock in Terryville and clearly illustrates that there is more potential yet to be unlocked as we further develop the Upper Red, along with the stacked pay opportunities in Terryville field. 
Like I said many times over the years in the Marcellus, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet in Terryville. 
We've also had a quick win on targeting. When drilling in the Upper Red prior to Range, the target for the lateral ranged from 100 to 125 feet thick, encompassing most of the reservoir. We believe there may be significant performance improvements by incorporating an approach where we target only the best across the interval, which is 20 to 40 feet thick, and then staying that much smaller target window for 100% of the lateral. We've already accomplished this on a few wells and expect to announce those results next year when those wells are completed. 
Bringing to bear the supply chain advantages of Range has also resulted in an early win. For example, we've already saved 7% in casing cost resulting in savings of over $50,000 per well, and we expect that there will be many examples of this going forward. 
As illustrated in these few early examples, we believe strongly that we can lower cost, improve well performance, improve operational efficiencies and lower our unit cost, while working safely and being good stewards of the environment and the communities where we live and work. We will bring to bear our operating philosophy of steady and strategic planning, implementing innovative and sound technology -- technologies and processes that have worked for us in the Marcellus while putting in place a long-term approach focused on economic and value-enhancing growth. 
Like Jeff mentioned, we're currently working on the 3 extension areas of wells. 2 of the wells are in the completion phase and the third well is nearing completion of the drilling phase. We expect to be able to have initial results from these 3 wells before year-end. 
Looking at the data collected thus far, the Upper Red sands in these wells have an average gas in place concentration, that is Bcf per vertical foot that is on par with the Upper Red in the very best part of Terryville, and they're twice as thick, yielding twice the gas in place as the Upper Red sands in Terryville. The Lower Red sands have an average gas in place concentration nearly 3x that of the best Lower Red in Terryville. Considering these wells are deeper and have a higher pressure gradient, we interpret the high reservoir pressure, better gas in plays and the favorable reservoir parameters to be cause for optimism regarding these areas in the basin. 
Of course, we won't know for sure until we see the actual production from the wells, but one of the many things that our technical team has learned, especially after drilling and analyzing the early data from these expansion wells, coupled with our analyses of the existing producing fields in the more than 50 vertical tests throughout the acreage, is that the Lower Cotton Valley sands in this portion of the basin are fairly consistent, giving us support for our optimism. Even so, this does not take into account the other 2 to 3 horizontal targets available throughout the acreage. 
Shifting back to the Terryville field. Both red zones and both pink zones have been tested to date, along with further development in the Upper Red, which has been the primary target. We'll also be looking at the lower red and the deep pink going forward. We see a lot of value in the stacked pay development and combined with lower cost are encouraged about the future potential in Terryville, along with the extension areas. 
For 2017, we'll enter the year with approximately 25 drilled and uncompleted wellbores in North Louisiana, which we plan to complete in the first quarter. This will result in outsized production growth early next year into what we think will be a stronger pricing environment. As we smooth out the completion activity going forward, I believe we'll have a Range-like approach of steady quarter-over-quarter growth in North Louisiana as we enter 2018. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. In addition to improving netbacks and the updates that Jeff discussed during his remarks, I'd like to re-emphasize a couple of points before I close. There have been a lot of questions about pipeline projects in Appalachia. Are they on time? And what impacts might they have on basis? and so forth. Remember that Range was the first mover in the basin, and we've been working on a diversified and layered portfolio of transportation for many years. As Jeff discussed, we believe the projects that we are in our on time. We sell to multiple markets and have been consistent in our strategy since we discovered the Marcellus. One pipe doesn't make a big difference to Range as we're diversified -- as we diversified our exposure over multiple pipes. 
Our 2017 natural gas differential is expected to improve by $0.10 to $0.15 based on current strip pricing, and our pricing is much more resilient having multiple outlets in a large base of North Louisiana production. 
Again, we just acquired a world-class asset in North Louisiana that gets very close to NYMEX pricing and provides marketing and capital flexibility. So now one pipe makes even less difference. 
We set capital budgets at the beginning of every year. The capital is allocated on a realtime basis. Having 2 of the most economic plays in the U.S. is a unique advantage, and we have the flexibility to allocate capital realtime as conditions dictate. None of our peers in Appalachia have this option. 
As both our Southern Marcellus and North Louisiana divisions continue to improve on costs, efficiencies and performance, we expect there will be a lot of value as markets improve. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger."

I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million. That's 36% higher than the second quarte",1011,"Thank you, Ray. I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million. That's 36% higher than the second quarter of this year. 
Cash flow at $123 million was 32% higher. EBITDAX at $160 million was 24% higher, and cash margin at $0.82 was 17% higher. Range has navigated this period of low commodity prices well. And by all measures, the third quarter of 2016 appears to mark a financial turning point for Range. 
Given that the third quarter includes only 15 days of operating results from Memorial merger, we're excited that we have not only turned the proverbial corner, but are now moving forward on a wider, unique and more prosperous new road. The reasons for optimism and confidence in the Range's path are multi-fold. We have attractive new optionality when deploying capital, production continues to steadily grow, the cost structure continues to improve, and the higher-margin marketing and transportation arrangements we've spoken of in prior quarters are now fully operational, delivering the improved cash flow and margins we predicted. 
Year-to-date cash flow was $316 million, and year-to-date EBITDAX was $424 million. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the quarter which, again, includes only 15 days of cash flow from the Memorial merger, was $0.68 per share. 
Looking closer at the third quarter cost structure performance, the Range teams have continued to do a terrific job holding a line on cash direct operating expense, which is $0.16 per Mcfe, was roughly the same as last quarter and a 38% improvement from the third quarter of last year. 
All of the unit cost items came in at/or favorable to guidance with the exception of interest expense, which was $0.04 over guidance due to nonrecurring transaction expenses associated with a successful senior subordinated note exchange, which I'll further discuss in a moment. 
The third quarter DD&A rate was $0.95 per Mcfe, identical to the prior quarter, and 18% better than the third quarter of last year. 
And please reference the third quarter earnings release for full fourth quarter 2016 unit cost expense guidance. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Investors will note many positive changes resulting from the Memorial merger. The third quarter debt-to-capitalization ratio improved from 49% at year-end 2015 to 41% at the end of the third quarter. Debt-to-rolling 4 quarter EBITDAX, including the Memorial debt and historical 4 quarters of their EBITDAX was 3.6x. The combined Range and Memorial balance sheet limit our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage to the mid-3x Range with the ratio getting better next year as higher cumulative cash flow improves the ratio moving into 2018. 
By the end of 2018, We expect the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio to have declined at least a full turn from continued growth at/or near cash flow. 
Our forward-looking recycle ratio remains above the 2x level as NYMEX prices have further strengthened, and our marketing contracts at North Louisiana production allow us to move more of our products at higher-margin sales points. 
The Memorial merger also provided an excellent opportunity to further advance our balance sheet structure. Premerger, Memorial had a partially funded, fully conforming $1 billion bank credit facility and $600 million in unsecured senior notes outstanding. 
Premerger, Range had a $3 billion bank credit facility with only $3 million outstanding against its $2 billion commitment amount. 
Range also had one issue of unsecured senior notes outstanding and 3 series of unsecured subordinated notes. The merger allowed Range to re-simplify the company's debt structure into a single bank credit facility and a single tier of unsecured senior notes through a comprehensive bond exchange and tender offer. And here's briefly how it worked. The Memorial bank credit facility was canceled at merger close. The collateral was released, and the outstanding balance was moved to the existing Range bank credit facility. Over 97% of the 3 series of Range subordinated notes were exchanged for like rate and like maturity Range senior notes, and the Memorial senior notes were exchanged into like kind Range senior notes or redeemed for cash at the holder's option, with the majority of the Memorial senior note holders choosing to accept Range notes rather than cash. 
The exchange was very successful. The Range subordinated notes are now senior notes. The Range in old Memorial senior notes are now all pari passu Range senior obligations and share the same covenant package as the Range existing 2025 senior notes. This allows bond investors to trade freely across the entire rate-of-maturity spectrum without making structural credit adjustments due to price. 
The exchange allowed Range to utilize some of our low-cost unused bank commitment, while still providing close to $1 billion in committed liquidity. Following the exchange, all of the Range bonds traded at tighter spreads than before the exchange, and both Moody's and S&P moved Range to stable outlook. While Range is not yet investment-grade, the bond exchange aligns our balance sheet closer to what is expected of an investment-grade company. My compliments to the Range finance team for completing this complex and highly successful series of transactions, which makes our balance sheet even easier to understand and positions us well for future growth in credit-quality improvement. 
The Range hedge position was significantly enhanced by the Memorial merger, with the post-merger hedge book holding higher hedge natural gas volumes and prices. Range also added hedge volumes across all of our products during the third quarter. And please reference the earnings release third quarter 10-Q and Range website for specific post-merger hedge volume and price information. 
In summary, the third quarter showed the fundamental improvements in top line revenue, cash flow and margins flowing through the Range financial statements that we have all worked so hard to achieve. With the financial statements reflecting only 15 days of Memorial ownership and the exciting results Range has discussed in both Appalachia and North Louisiana, we look forward to continued operating and financial progress in the quarters ahead. 
Jeff, back to you."

Again, I want to stress when you look at 2017, we're projecting an organic growth rate of 11% to 13%, and really, that's an output from several different scenarios where we're allocating various percentages of capital between the Marcellus and North Louisiana. Again, I think it's a great question and a really important one because it highlights our ability to choose between 2 great assets, each near key market areas in the Northeast and in the Gulf Coast. Both areas we have the ability to ramp production and are expected to get good growth next year relative to '16, and we can do that for a long time into the future. Another key thing, I think, that's kind of a unique ability we have to react to upcoming changes. And capital allocation, in my opinion, is a real advantage that Range has that other companies don't have or a lot of our peers don't have. So it's a function of several things. We run multiple scenarios. And you're right, Arun, we think as we continue to grow and ramp volumes, which we expect to do in North Louisiana, that cost that you mentioned will come down significantly. With time we can really drive down the processing and gathering costs."

With the infrastructure in place, of course, when you go back onto existing pad, you don't have to build a pad, the road, meter taps, production facilities, the water infrastructure; all of that stuff is already there. And you can see savings on a per-well basis ranging from $200,000 up to -- I mean, there's one example in our presentation, for example, that's $850,000. And they're not all going to be $850,000, they're not all going to be $200,000. I think every case is going to be specific. But as we roll into '17, and we see as much as 1/3 of our wells potentially next year in our current plans today, which, of course, will change, but when we look at it today, we see maybe 1/3 of our wells next year on existing pads, that could move to as high as half of our wells potentially in '18. And I think over time, you're going to see some major improvements to capital efficiency.

I think in areas potentially like West Texas and maybe the scoop stack areas in places like that where activity seems to have ramped up quite a bit more. You can see prices moving up. In the Marcellus per se, we don't see it. We are entering into what we term long-term relationships, not necessarily contracts. I think contracts is a term that gets way overused when talking about service companies because every contract is different and has different outs and different resets and everything else that people put in there. But we focus a lot on long-term relationships, and we don't see any important or significant price increases going onto '17. It's a little hard to see past that yet because I think a lot of it depends on commodity prices and what we see there. And we're pretty excited about the future going forward. We've got 2 great plays. We can allocate capital freely back and forth between the 2 plays. We have organizations and opportunities in place to significantly ramp up both sides of that. And so I think that we have a ton of really high-class opportunities going forward. And I think we're going to be well positioned to adjust to whatever happens on the service side."

And in fact, there's an example in the presentation that has got about 2 -- over 2 years of production history on it, and it was a pad that we went on to 5-well pad and put 2 additional wells on it, and we were wanting to answer 3 questions. One, how much money did we actually save? #2, did the wells interfere with the existing wells that were already there? And then #3, since we were going onto a pad that was already 2 years old, would a better targeting and a better completion designs, in other words, 2 more years of learnings, would that really helped the completion? And the answer was as presented on that slide, we saved $850,000 per well, which is huge. The wells did not impact the existing target. And literally, the new wells were literally only targeted about 20 or 30 feet different from the original well. So even in the same zone, which is only about 80 or 90 feet thick in that area, we were only about 20 feet apart in difference, and we were 700 feet between wells, so we did not impact the existing wells. So that's was a huge learning for us. And we've repeated that several times since. And then the third thing is the wells after 2 years of production were 53% better producers than the original wells. So you can start to imagine if you just go through that hundreds of times going forward in the future, you can start seeing what sort of capital efficiencies you could bake in to that. And it's pretty impressive. So we've literally got a lot of that to do. I think a year or so ago, we were about 10% on existing pads. This year, I think we're probably less than that, hardly any on existing pads. Another important thing that's happened this year is we have all our HBP concerns are finished. So literally, we have no more acreage at risk, and so we no longer have to worry about that aspect, which allows us to, going forward, really focus our capital in the very best returns, and that's what you're going to see us doing going forward. And I think you'll see those numbers gradually increase. I don't think it'll ever be 100% because clearly we've got some really good areas like in the eastern part of Washington County in our dry acreage, where even at grass rich brand-new 4-well pad there has even got better economics than going back onto an existing wet or super-rich pad. So I think it allows us realtime to allocate capital to the very best projects in the Marcellus, and  then now, of course, we've got another world class asset, North Louisiana, and that gives us another great option."

The integration of the teams and the assets was going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high-quality assets in both our Marcellus Shale division and the new North Louisiana division. 
I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the quarter and then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that I believe set us up for success. 
Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit cost resulted in solid operating results for the third quarter, and due to the closing date, 15 days of solid performance from the North Louisiana team were represented in the quarterly numbers. 
The third quarter took us one step closer to seeing meaningful improvements in realized prices across all of our products. First, all 3 of our liquids projects were online during the quarter: ATEX, Mariner West and Mariner East. We sold ethane to Europe, Canada and to the Gulf Coast and exported propane from Marcus Hook in international markets. The net effect is that our NGL price increased from 13% of WTI to 25% of WTI on a year-over-year basis. 
Second, we have a new condensate sales agreements, which commenced on July 1. These agreements approved our corporate condensate realizations from a $13 differential to WTI to a $6 differential to WTI on a year-over-year basis in a similar improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Third, NYMEX gas prices were higher in the third quarter, and all of the gas pipelines we are contracted on are expected to be on schedule. This includes Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion, which came online earlier this month on October 4. This transportation allows us to move an additional 150 million per day of all Marcellus production to the Gulf Coast. 
Like the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, which became operational this time last year, this project immediately improves our expected Marcellus netbacks. The next 2 projects for Range are Colombia's Leach/Rayne XPress and ATP's Rover Phase II, both of which have received first final EIS approval and both of which we understand will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
As a result of this increased transport in our growing North Louisiana production, we expect to see corporate natural gas differentials improving to approximately $0.46 next quarter based on current strip pricing, and approximately $0.33 in 2017. All else being equal, these improved netbacks should improve margins substantially in 2017, and we expect further improvements in 2018. 
Let me turn to North Louisiana and give an update there. The integration, as I mentioned earlier, is going very well, and the North Louisiana division is accomplishing a lot. Let me give a few examples. 
First, we just set a record for the fastest spud to rig release of any well drilled to date in Terryville field and then repeated that record with the second well. In addition, we just completed one of the best producing wells ever drilled in the field to date. Our Purchasing Department has also made good progress, and we're achieving cost reductions on that front as a result. Ray will talk more specifically about these accomplishments and improvements in a few minutes. 
The North Louisiana team has also had some early success refining the targeting and landing in the Lower Cotton Valley. As an example, they just finished drilling some wells that were entirely within a much tighter target within the Upper Red. Once we complete the wells, we'll see what effect this has on performance. 
It's early, but we're also excited about the North Louisiana extension areas. The team has drilled the pilot holes for the first 3 extension wells, all testing new areas several miles away from Terryville and far away from each other. 
Based on extensive logs, courts and shows, all 3 vertical pilots look very encouraging. In addition, we have drilled in case the horizontal laterals on 2 of the 3 pilot holes. Again, the results to date look encouraging. 
The third lateral is currently being drilled. We expect to have all 3 wells drilled, completed and tested by the end of this year. The results of the wells will help provide additional data regarding the extension areas that will be rolled into our planning for 2017 and 2018. 
On a macro level, there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of the year. 
Based on available data, it appears 2016 will be the first time that natural gas production will decline on a year-over-year basis since 2005. This supply decline is happening, while demand for natural gas is increasing, driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports. 
Looking towards 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3, and we think it can continue to climb. 
Based on where strip pricing is today, we believe that we can grow the combined company at 33% to 35% for 2017. This equates to an organic growth rate of 11% to 13% for 2017, coupled with the full year of the North Louisiana division versus roughly a quarter in 2016. 
Importantly, this preliminary plan for 2017 also results in strong growth for 2018. Assuming a $3.25 per mcf and $60 per barrel, we are projecting that we should achieve organic growth for 2018 of approximately 20%. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Lower Cotton Valley assets are 2 of the lowest-cost gas plays in the United States, which resulted in a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth. This combination creates a unique portfolio that is strategically located near key demand centers with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. 
The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. 
In summary, we believe that Range offers investors 5 key positive attributes. The first is a very high quality low-cost asset base in 2 very supplementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back on to existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. 
Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also are drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. 
The third key attribute is top-tier operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. 
The fourth is a strong marketing effort highlighted by the Range's ability to sell its products to into multiple markets, enhanced by our nearly acquired North Louisiana assets and demonstrated in our expecting pricing improvements across all products heading into the fourth quarter of 2016 and further into 2017. 
Finally, Range has an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations."

We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf eq",2370,"Thanks, Jeff. We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day. And for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Excluding the asset sales and the North Louisiana volumes, we expect to grow 10% over last year as previously guided, while maintaining our capital expenditure level at approximately $495 million. And importantly, we plan to end 2016 with an exit rate higher than last year, setting us up well for 2017 and beyond. 
We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and this is something that we're really proud of. Specifically, driving this improvement in the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 35% reduction in LOE year-to-date versus the average for 2015. This was achieved through 3 key areas. One, leveraging service cost with our long-term vendor relationships; two, reductions in third-party manpower; and three, the savings associated with our water handling through our water logistics team, which gets water from our production pads to our frac operation quicker than ever. 
Staying with our Marcellus activity, capital efficiency continues to improve. And I'll review some examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
On the water front, we've continued the improvements that we discussed on the last call, and we'll reduce our capital expenditures for water by over $20 million this year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 20% as compared to last year. 
Our top 3 pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.5 stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 23% below the average, which, again, was already 20% lower than last year. 
We're forecasting a 16% reduction in CapEx for production facilities resulting in almost $6 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and material, and redeployment of existing equipment. 
On the drilling side, we've achieved a 5% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, and 8 of our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day have been this year. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward. 
As we covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. Again, all of this being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company. 
Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages in our wet area with full facilities on a new build full well pad for approximately $7.2 million per well. 
In comparison to our peers, our cost is less. In fact over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics. 
I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. Like I reported on the last call, we are now drilling a 7-well pad in our super-rich area averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells during the third quarter, but before I do that, I want to remind everyone that these rates will all be reported as constrained actual rates to sales. 
In our dry area, a 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 5,300 feet in 28 stages per well was completed and had an average 24-hour rate to sales of 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day. 
In our wet area, 2 pads showed excellent results. A 4-well pad with an average lateral length of 6,800 feet in 35 stages produced at 22 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and a 6-well pad with an average lateral length of 4,500 feet and 23 stages produced at $19 million a day per well. 
On the last couple of calls, we've also discussed our unique advantage of the expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at lower cost, thereby increasing capital efficiencies, while allowing us to ramp up quicker than any of our peers. 
Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we can eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with 5 or fewer wells, and 59 producing pads with 6 to 9 wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals at very attractive cost. 
Although it's early in the planning process, in Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about 1/3 of our wells on existing pads in 2017. That number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is planned to be over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that 2018 average lateral length will be longer. Again, these are early estimates and will most certainly change over time. 
What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads, and we have permits at hand with infrastructure in place to yield further improving capital efficiencies going forward. 
Shifting now to North Louisiana. The integration is going very well. We'll be operating those assets out of our new North Louisiana division office in Houston under the direction of John Applegath, Senior Vice President of the new North Louisiana division, who has relocated there to Houston from our Southern Marcellus division office in Pittsburgh. 
Dennis Degner, now Vice President of the Southern Marcellus division, stepped up to take over the Southern Marcellus shale division. We are extremely proud of both of these gentlemen and their accomplishments. The record is clear. And through their leadership, we expect continued improvements in capital efficiency, coupled with improving well performance in both areas. 
When we originally evaluated the Memorial assets, our expectations were that we can improve over the already impressive results they had seen there. For example, we felt there was potential in terms of drilling times and costs, coupled with improvements in well performance by optimizing the target window and staying in zone, all of which, which should result in improved efficiencies and productivity over time. 
Even though we've only had the Range for approximately 6 weeks, as Jeff referred to in his remarks, John and the new team are already achieving some significant wins. We just set the record for spud to rig release in Terryville of 30 days and have now repeated it on the second well. To date, this year, the well's averaging more than 5,000 feet of lateral length, the average has been 40 days. This 25% improvement in efficiency was achieved by implementing more aggressive bps and high-speed, high-differential motors. 
A lot of these ideas and many more coming are the result of us bringing in Scott Chesebrough as our new Vice President of drilling. Scott has a ton of experience in high-pressure high-temperature drilling across the world and was actually involved in the vertical drilling in the Vernon Field. We expect Scott and his new team will be able to significantly improve drilling performance and cost as we go forward. 
In the last batch of wells that were completed, we also saw one of the highest productive wells in Terryville to date. It had a 30-day IP to sales of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day per 1,000 foot or over 27 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is 68% higher than the average. 
We believe this is a real testament to both the team and the quality of the rock in Terryville and clearly illustrates that there is more potential yet to be unlocked as we further develop the Upper Red, along with the stacked pay opportunities in Terryville field. 
Like I said many times over the years in the Marcellus, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet in Terryville. 
We've also had a quick win on targeting. When drilling in the Upper Red prior to Range, the target for the lateral ranged from 100 to 125 feet thick, encompassing most of the reservoir. We believe there may be significant performance improvements by incorporating an approach where we target only the best across the interval, which is 20 to 40 feet thick, and then staying that much smaller target window for 100% of the lateral. We've already accomplished this on a few wells and expect to announce those results next year when those wells are completed. 
Bringing to bear the supply chain advantages of Range has also resulted in an early win. For example, we've already saved 7% in casing cost resulting in savings of over $50,000 per well, and we expect that there will be many examples of this going forward. 
As illustrated in these few early examples, we believe strongly that we can lower cost, improve well performance, improve operational efficiencies and lower our unit cost, while working safely and being good stewards of the environment and the communities where we live and work. We will bring to bear our operating philosophy of steady and strategic planning, implementing innovative and sound technology -- technologies and processes that have worked for us in the Marcellus while putting in place a long-term approach focused on economic and value-enhancing growth. 
Like Jeff mentioned, we're currently working on the 3 extension areas of wells. 2 of the wells are in the completion phase and the third well is nearing completion of the drilling phase. We expect to be able to have initial results from these 3 wells before year-end. 
Looking at the data collected thus far, the Upper Red sands in these wells have an average gas in place concentration, that is Bcf per vertical foot that is on par with the Upper Red in the very best part of Terryville, and they're twice as thick, yielding twice the gas in place as the Upper Red sands in Terryville. The Lower Red sands have an average gas in place concentration nearly 3x that of the best Lower Red in Terryville. Considering these wells are deeper and have a higher pressure gradient, we interpret the high reservoir pressure, better gas in plays and the favorable reservoir parameters to be cause for optimism regarding these areas in the basin. 
Of course, we won't know for sure until we see the actual production from the wells, but one of the many things that our technical team has learned, especially after drilling and analyzing the early data from these expansion wells, coupled with our analyses of the existing producing fields in the more than 50 vertical tests throughout the acreage, is that the Lower Cotton Valley sands in this portion of the basin are fairly consistent, giving us support for our optimism. Even so, this does not take into account the other 2 to 3 horizontal targets available throughout the acreage. 
Shifting back to the Terryville field. Both red zones and both pink zones have been tested to date, along with further development in the Upper Red, which has been the primary target. We'll also be looking at the lower red and the deep pink going forward. We see a lot of value in the stacked pay development and combined with lower cost are encouraged about the future potential in Terryville, along with the extension areas. 
For 2017, we'll enter the year with approximately 25 drilled and uncompleted wellbores in North Louisiana, which we plan to complete in the first quarter. This will result in outsized production growth early next year into what we think will be a stronger pricing environment. As we smooth out the completion activity going forward, I believe we'll have a Range-like approach of steady quarter-over-quarter growth in North Louisiana as we enter 2018. 
Switching to marketing for a few minutes. In addition to improving netbacks and the updates that Jeff discussed during his remarks, I'd like to re-emphasize a couple of points before I close. There have been a lot of questions about pipeline projects in Appalachia. Are they on time? And what impacts might they have on basis? and so forth. Remember that Range was the first mover in the basin, and we've been working on a diversified and layered portfolio of transportation for many years. As Jeff discussed, we believe the projects that we are in our on time. We sell to multiple markets and have been consistent in our strategy since we discovered the Marcellus. One pipe doesn't make a big difference to Range as we're diversified -- as we diversified our exposure over multiple pipes. 
Our 2017 natural gas differential is expected to improve by $0.10 to $0.15 based on current strip pricing, and our pricing is much more resilient having multiple outlets in a large base of North Louisiana production. 
Again, we just acquired a world-class asset in North Louisiana that gets very close to NYMEX pricing and provides marketing and capital flexibility. So now one pipe makes even less difference. 
We set capital budgets at the beginning of every year. The capital is allocated on a realtime basis. Having 2 of the most economic plays in the U.S. is a unique advantage, and we have the flexibility to allocate capital realtime as conditions dictate. None of our peers in Appalachia have this option. 
As both our Southern Marcellus and North Louisiana divisions continue to improve on costs, efficiencies and performance, we expect there will be a lot of value as markets improve. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger."

I'm delighted to report that third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million.

Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash settled derivatives was $304 million. That's 36% higher than the second quarter of this year. 
Cash flow at $123 million was 32% higher. EBITDAX at $160 million was 24% higher, and cash margin at $0.82 was 17% higher. Range has navigated this period of low commodity prices well. And by all measures, the third quarter of 2016 appears to mark a financial turning point for Range. 
Given that the third quarter includes only 15 days of operating results from Memorial merger, we're excited that we have not only turned the proverbial corner, but are now moving forward on a wider, unique and more prosperous new road. The reasons for optimism and confidence in the Range's path are multi-fold. We have attractive new optionality when deploying capital, production continues to steadily grow, the cost structure continues to improve, and the higher-margin marketing and transportation arrangements we've spoken of in prior quarters are now fully operational, delivering the improved cash flow and margins we predicted. 
Year-to-date cash flow was $316 million, and year-to-date EBITDAX was $424 million. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the quarter which, again, includes only 15 days of cash flow from the Memorial merger, was $0.68 per share. 
Looking closer at the third quarter cost structure performance, the Range teams have continued to do a terrific job holding a line on cash direct operating expense, which is $0.16 per Mcfe, was roughly the same as last quarter and a 38% improvement from the third quarter of last year. 
All of the unit cost items came in at/or favorable to guidance with the exception of interest expense, which was $0.04 over guidance due to nonrecurring transaction expenses associated with a successful senior subordinated note exchange, which I'll further discuss in a moment. 
The third quarter DD&A rate was $0.95 per Mcfe, identical to the prior quarter, and 18% better than the third quarter of last year. 
And please reference the third quarter earnings release for full fourth quarter 2016 unit cost expense guidance. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Investors will note many positive changes resulting from the Memorial merger. The third quarter debt-to-capitalization ratio improved from 49% at year-end 2015 to 41% at the end of the third quarter. Debt-to-rolling 4 quarter EBITDAX, including the Memorial debt and historical 4 quarters of their EBITDAX was 3.6x. The combined Range and Memorial balance sheet limit our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage to the mid-3x Range with the ratio getting better next year as higher cumulative cash flow improves the ratio moving into 2018. 
By the end of 2018, We expect the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio to have declined at least a full turn from continued growth at/or near cash flow. 
Our forward-looking recycle ratio remains above the 2x level as NYMEX prices have further strengthened, and our marketing contracts at North Louisiana production allow us to move more of our products at higher-margin sales points. 
The Memorial merger also provided an excellent opportunity to further advance our balance sheet structure. Premerger, Memorial had a partially funded, fully conforming $1 billion bank credit facility and $600 million in unsecured senior notes outstanding. 
Premerger, Range had a $3 billion bank credit facility with only $3 million outstanding against its $2 billion commitment amount. 
Range also had one issue of unsecured senior notes outstanding and 3 series of unsecured subordinated notes. The merger allowed Range to re-simplify the company's debt structure into a single bank credit facility and a single tier of unsecured senior notes through a comprehensive bond exchange and tender offer. And here's briefly how it worked. The Memorial bank credit facility was canceled at merger close. The collateral was released, and the outstanding balance was moved to the existing Range bank credit facility. Over 97% of the 3 series of Range subordinated notes were exchanged for like rate and like maturity Range senior notes, and the Memorial senior notes were exchanged into like kind Range senior notes or redeemed for cash at the holder's option, with the majority of the Memorial senior note holders choosing to accept Range notes rather than cash. 
The exchange was very successful. The Range subordinated notes are now senior notes. The Range in old Memorial senior notes are now all pari passu Range senior obligations and share the same covenant package as the Range existing 2025 senior notes. This allows bond investors to trade freely across the entire rate-of-maturity spectrum without making structural credit adjustments due to price. 
The exchange allowed Range to utilize some of our low-cost unused bank commitment, while still providing close to $1 billion in committed liquidity. Following the exchange, all of the Range bonds traded at tighter spreads than before the exchange, and both Moody's and S&P moved Range to stable outlook. While Range is not yet investment-grade, the bond exchange aligns our balance sheet closer to what is expected of an investment-grade company. My compliments to the Range finance team for completing this complex and highly successful series of transactions, which makes our balance sheet even easier to understand and positions us well for future growth in credit-quality improvement. 
The Range hedge position was significantly enhanced by the Memorial merger, with the post-merger hedge book holding higher hedge natural gas volumes and prices. Range also added hedge volumes across all of our products during the third quarter. And please reference the earnings release third quarter 10-Q and Range website for specific post-merger hedge volume and price information. 
In summary, the third quarter showed the fundamental improvements in top line revenue, cash flow and margins flowing through the Range financial statements that we have all worked so hard to achieve. With the financial statements reflecting only 15 days of Memorial ownership and the exciting results Range has discussed in both Appalachia and North Louisiana, we look forward to continued operating and financial progress in the quarters ahead. 
Jeff, back to you."

Again, I think it's a great question and a really important one because it highlights our ability to choose between 2 great assets, each near key market areas in the Northeast and in the Gulf Coast. Both areas we have the ability to ramp production and are expected to get good growth next year relative to '16, and we can do that for a long time into the future. Another key thing, I think, that's kind of a unique ability we have to react to upcoming changes. And capital allocation, in my opinion, is a real advantage that Range has that other companies don't have or a lot of our peers don't have. So it's a function of several things. We run multiple scenarios. And you're right, Arun, we think as we continue to grow and ramp volumes, which we expect to do in North Louisiana, that cost that you mentioned will come down significantly. With time we can really drive down the processing and gathering costs."

With the infrastructure in place, of course, when you go back onto existing pad, you don't have to build a pad, the road, meter taps, production facilities, the water infrastructure; all of that stuff is already there.

And they're not all going to be $850,000, they're not all going to be $200,000. I think every case is going to be specific. But as we roll into '17, and we see as much as 1/3 of our wells potentially next year in our current plans today, which, of course, will change, but when we look at it today, we see maybe 1/3 of our wells next year on existing pads, that could move to as high as half of our wells potentially in '18. And I think over time, you're going to see some major improvements to capital efficiency.

I think contracts is a term that gets way overused when talking about service companies because every contract is different and has different outs and different resets and everything else that people put in there.

And in fact, there's an example in the presentation that has got about 2 -- over 2 years of production history on it, and it was a pad that we went on to 5-well pad and put 2 additional wells on it, and we were wanting to answer 3 questions. One, how much money did we actually save? #2, did the wells interfere with the existing wells that were already there? And then #3, since we were going onto a pad that was already 2 years old, would a better targeting and a better completion designs, in other words, 2 more years of learnings, would that really helped the completion? And the answer was as presented on that slide, we saved $850,000 per well, which is huge. The wells did not impact the existing target. And literally, the new wells were literally only targeted about 20 or 30 feet different from the original well. So even in the same zone, which is only about 80 or 90 feet thick in that area, we were only about 20 feet apart in difference, and we were 700 feet between wells, so we did not impact the existing wells. So that's was a huge learning for us. And we've repeated that several times since. And then the third thing is the wells after 2 years of production were 53% better producers than the original wells. So you can start to imagine if you just go through that hundreds of times going forward in the future, you can start seeing what sort of capital efficiencies you could bake in to that. And it's pretty impressive. So we've literally got a lot of that to do. I think a year or so ago, we were about 10% on existing pads. This year, I think we're probably less than that, hardly any on existing pads. Another important thing that's happened this year is we have all our HBP concerns are finished. So literally, we have no more acreage at risk, and so we no longer have to worry about that aspect, which allows us to, going forward, really focus our capital in the very best returns, and that's what you're going to see us doing going forward. And I think you'll see those numbers gradually increase. I don't think it'll ever be 100% because clearly we've got some really good areas like in the eastern part of Washington County in our dry acreage, where even at grass rich brand-new 4-well pad there has even got better economics than going back onto an existing wet or super-rich pad. So I think it allows us realtime to allocate capital to the very best projects in the Marcellus, and  then now, of course, we've got another world class asset, North Louisiana, and that gives us another great option."
