We had a fourth quarter adjusted loss of $27 million or $0.18 per share. Fourth quarter production, 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 53% oil. The top end of our guidance, revised guidance from 2013 to 2015, that's an increase of about 4,000 barrels a day or 2% versus the prior quarter. Full year production, 204,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 52% oil versus 48% in 2014. That's an increase of 22,000 barrels a day or 12% versus '14. Oil production was up 18,000 barrels a day or 21% versus 2014. Obviously, the growth was driven primarily by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin. 
Also, we delivered 273% drillbit reserve replacement of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent and a drill bit fined F&D cost of about $10 per BOE. Again shows you the true prolific nature of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp with average operating cost of a typical Wolfcamp well of $5 and a fining cost of about $10. It still shows it's very economical in this today's environment, we'll still be drilling in this play. 
Slide #4. We did place 44 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp during the fourth quarter. As expected, early production from 35 wells in north and 9 wells in the south is exceeding expectations as we had mentioned earlier in January, primarily due to company's completion optimization program. Also, continuing to strive toward great capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, really driven by service cost reductions, efficiency gains and completion optimization program. We did issue $500 million at 3.5% senior notes due 2021 and $500 million at 4.5% senior notes due 2026 in December to refund payment of our '16 and '17 maturities, and that will be coming up over the next 12 months. 
Working with midstream partners to have our oil export facilities along the Gulf Coast operational by mid-2016. We did see the first cargo goal out recently, not by us, by another producer. It's the first WTI cargo I saw. It went to the Caribbean and mixing with the heavy Venezuelan crude. So people are starting to pay somewhat of a premium, so we hope we can get some crude out. The only crude that I've seen go out before that were a couple of the Eagle Ford oil cargoes from the Eagle Ford play from 2 other operators. 
But what's most important for us is that the long-term strip has narrowed to essentially nothing between Brent and WTI. 
On #5, our plan. Obviously, we made a change since early January. The primary reason for the change is that the entire strip for 2016 has dropped over $10 during that time frame. Much faster than I thought, and we had thought at the management team, at the board level, so that's why we have developed this response to that. So we're reducing our horizontal drilling activity by 50% from 24 rigs down to 12 by mid-2016, while still growing production by 10%-plus and preserving the company's strong balance sheet and cash position. Eagle Ford will be going from 6 rigs to 0 during the first quarter, 2 rigs are in release. Also in Eagle Ford, we will have 17 docks that will hold off and decide when prices come back, which I expect in 2017. Reducing southern Wolfcamp joint venture area from 4 rigs to 0 by mid-2016 will be used in the rest of our carry is the reason that we're running those rigs until mid-year to fully utilize the rest of the carrier from south Wolfcamp. Reducing northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp from 14 to 12 really for capital preservation, already released 1 rig. We were going back and forth between 12 and 14, we feel like that we wanted to get our capital budget down about $2 billion so there's no magic about it. But what's amazing is that we're still growing 50%, 10%-plus by cutting half of our rigs. A great accomplishment to the Permian team. Reallocating 2 Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Reduction in drilling activity in vertical integration spending results in capital expenditure of about $2 billion for '16, that's down from our preliminary forecast in early January of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and from actual spending in j 2015 of $2.2 billion. That's $1.85 billion for drilling, that does include tank batteries, SWDs, salt water disposal wells and gas processing facilities. And the additional $150 million for a vertical integration systems upgrades and filled facilities. 
Slide #6, a continuation of our plan. We are probably the best hedged company in regard to oil again for 2016 and we do have 20% for 2017. And we do have great gas coverage, 70% for 2016. Again, we have a great balance sheet, probably the best in the industry today. When you look at our $500 million coming due from enterprise and look at $400 million of cash on the balance sheet with additional $1.6 billion from our recent equity offering, we essentially have 0 debt today. So obviously, the best balance sheet among any major and any independent in the marketplace. And that's one of the reasons we decided to grow above [ph] 10%-plus, and preserve roughly about $1.7 billion going into 2017. And if prices recover, mid-'16, if they recover late 2016, they recover early '17, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else and get back to our 15% growth profile over the next several years. 
Slide #7 on drilling completions capital. Capital program again, up $2 billion, $1.85 billion drilling completion, GNC 90% of its in the north. I won't go over the detail here, but any questions, you can please get Frank and Mike in the group calls afterwards. Other capital of $150 million, and again, the capital program funding from our cash flow, plus using a combination of our enterprise funds of $500 million coming midyear and $400 million in cash that we had at the end of the year in late 2015. 
Slide #8. Looking at going forward. You can see that we are growing 10%-plus. I still think that number is going to lead any company with oil production of any major and independent in the U.S. marketplace. We can -- again, we have the firepower to start it back up fairly quickly. We were looking at 224,000 barrels a day plus for the year 2016 north from 52% oil to 56% oil. You can see most of the pickup will be in the second, third and fourth quarters as we have given out guidance of about 211 to 216 for the fourth quarter. And again long term, '16 to '18, we do show growth in this low strip price environment. '17 will be again, around 10%, reserving over half of our cash of $1.7 billion by the end of '17, and so Pioneer can essentially weather '16 and '17 without increasing debt and be able to jumpstart at any point in time over the next 2 years as prices recover. 
I'm going now turn it over to Tim to get more detail about operations."

We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our drilling and completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quart",2104,"Thanks, Scott. We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our drilling and completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quarter. You can see the production profile in the chart below as the dark blue line represents those wells early production. As very clear when you look at that, these exceptionally strong production results, we're seeing the strongest to date in our program, and it's very clear that these wells are as tracking that million-barrel BOE type curve showing in the dash line. We do also put 2 Wolfcamp A wells on production right at the end of the year. Those are shown in the red line below on the grass you can see there's very little production data. Our current thinking is that we'll be seeing more day as time goes on, but we're putting these wells on gas lift almost immediately they had IP rates of about 1,570 barrels per day. Of course, early in the life of these wells, we'll be reporting more about those in the next quarter. 
When you look at the performance of the wells from the third quarter, it's very clear that we have similar results in the sense if you're looking at the 28 B wells and 2A wells shown on the graph, 1 in light blue and the other in orange, respectively. Once again, we have a limited data set on A wells, only 2, but they're performing exceptionally well, well over the million barrel type curve. And when you look at the third quarter B wells, they also performed exceptionally well. So you can also see from this graph is we're improving quarter-to-quarter sequentially in terms of the performance of these wells. And that has to do with a great extent related to our completion optimization program. About 2/3 of the wells in the third quarter were subject to completion optimization, and all of the fourth quarter wells were exposed to completion optimization. And so you can see the uplift we're generating as a result of optimizing these wells. When I talk about optimization, it's several different factors that we're testing in bars different areas. For example, generally, we're changing the stage lengths from 240 feet to 150 feet. We're changing the clusters per stage generally from 4 to 5, we're pumping more fluid somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 barrels per foot compared to the prior 30 barrels per foot. And importantly, we've increased the same concentrations for these wells in the fourth quarter, up to about 1,500 ounce per foot from a total of about 1,100 from prior completions. We're going to outline in a little bit later in the slide deck the expansion of some of these ideas even to further optimization in our '16 campaign. I would say, as we're pointing out, if you look at the table below that, of the 22 Wolfcamp B wells put on production, they average exceedingly strong IPs of 2,200 barrels per day on a BOE basis. And that compares with 1,900 in terms of the campaign from the third quarter. So a dramatic increases as we continue to see -- as completion optimization is paying off very well. 
Turning now to Slide 10. We've seen several successes in the Lower Spraberry Shale where we POPd 11 wells during the quarter. The early production results, as you can see on the graph, are close to that same 1 million barrel EUR-type curve that we did completion optimizations on 9 of the 11 wells. And essentially using the exact same style of fracked optimization completion optimization that I mentioned regarding the Wolfcamp zones. The production on some of these wells is really continuing to build. In fact, only 5 out of these 11 wells have actually reached their IP rates. They're continuing to build not atypical for Lower Spraberry Shales as we take the water off the system, oil rates increase, and peaked quite a long ways into the early production life. So we'll having be more to report regarding these wells as we their IPs and incorporate that into the first quarter report. 
Turning to Slide 11. Once again, we're seeing strong results in the south, with the JV area, at the Wolfcamp, where we're using essentially the same optimization techniques. We placed 9 wells on production in the southern Wolfcamp area. Of the 8 Wolfcamp B wells, you can see on the graph below, the left the blue line, tracking above a million barrel type curve, and the Wolfcamp A wells that was drilled 1 of the 9 wells shown in the red curve in the right, is tracking between 800,000 BOE and 1 million BOE in terms of its type curve. So these are very good wells on the south, and you can see this is very serious in the south, they're going to compete very well with the north. Again, all of these were optimized using similar optimization packages as we had discussed earlier in the prior slides. 
Now then turning to Slide 12. The optimization and productivity gains I've already mentioned are leading to a high level of capital efficiency. That is critical, of course, when we're faced with the low commodity price environment as we see today. You can see on our left graph here that we continue to see dramatic improvements when it comes to our drilling campaign and completion campaigns where we're dropping our costs dramatically sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. We've decreased our cost for D&C in the north B wells by an average of about 30% over the last year, which is really phenomenal result. At the same time, as you see the curves on the right, we're seeing sequential increases in cumulative production per well as we go through time. That is reflected in the prior slides that I've already mentioned. But you can see pretty dramatically here that of the 90-day average rate, our production is up of about 830 BOE per day in 2014's fourth quarter to 1,250 in this last fourth quarter. So it's very clear if you look at data that IPs are well correlated to well EURs. And so you can see we had a dramatic improvement as a result of our capital efficiency and optimization programs. So it does gives us confidence that we are, in fact, increasing capital efficiency through time, and that allows us to continue drilling today albeit at a slower rate based on the commodity price deck. 
Turning to Slide 13. And this is now reflecting on the 2016 campaign for the Spraberry/Wolfcamp B and C budget. As Scott's already mentioned some of this so I'll be brief. We are going to be moving to 12 rigs in the North, as he said, 0 in the South and expect in doing so to still place 230 wells on production this year, split 60% Wolfcamp B and the balance being Wolfcamp A and lower Spraberry Shales of about 190 wells in the north and 40 in the south. And despite the fact we've had weak commodity prices as I mentioned earlier, we are still generating good returns on the wells we're drilling. The optimization campaign is certainly helping that. What we're planning on doing in certain areas is actually furthering that optimization campaign to, for example, in some areas, actually reduce the stage lengths of these cluster lengths to about 15 feet, and 10 clusters per stage. We're looking at increasing the fluid utilization up to about 50 barrels per foot, and increasing our sand concentration as up to 1,700 to 2,000 pounds per foot. At the same time, we continue to experiment with less coarse sand concentration, so 40 70 sand and 100 mesh sand. And in doing so, we can put more of a focus on slick water fluid utilization versus gels. We're also, in all these areas, adjusting spacing and stacking as we learn more in each area. We really heavily on the process of learning the best way to complete the wells, and it's not the case, it's the same in every area for every zone. So we are going to learn a lot this year and it's one of the benefits of continuing a drilling campaign. Cost are coming in about 7.5 million to 8 million, that's based on a 9,000 foot lateral, and incorporates the optimize completions cost. And the program that we're talking about in terms of production growth, we're incorporating EURs in the range depending upon the zone from 800,000 BOE to about 1.2 million BOE based on depending, on which zone we're dealing with. And we have IRRs in this campaign, even at current strip prices, they are up to 30%. As Scott already mentioned, with our cost being low to develop this production and operating cost being lower, returns are very solid. 
Turning now to Slide 14. We continue to build out the required infrastructure albeit at a slower rate of spending based on what's going on with the price downturn. In terms of tank batteries and salt water disposal facilities, we spent about $170 million this year. In doing so, we're reducing our cost per well that's hooked up and put on production from about $900,000 to about $750,000 this year. That's a benefit of the scale coming from the fact of a prior spending on centralization of the facilities. And so we're beginning to see the benefits that come from preplanning and prespending in the form of reduced cost at well zone. We'll spend about $45 million in gas processing. The most important part of that is completing the Buffalo plant in Mark County in the second quarter this year. There are no new plants after that in the foreseeable future. We did announce the start up of a 20-mile pipeline to deliver word water, nonpotable water from the City of Odessa to our Midland County locations, and that's going to save us a tremendous sum about -- we calculated $100,000 per well once this water starts being utilized. It just started flowing last week. We also spent about $45 million-or-so when it comes to main line expansions and other subsystems. And just like the Odessa deal, we continue to pursue purchasing from the city of Midland effluent water in a similar way, those negotiations continue. Finally on this slide, the completion of the expansion on the very same line has been postponed as you might expect until we're at a point we're going to be adding more rigs.
Turning now to Slide 15. We certainly have begun to see the effects of the strong wells results I showed in the production. If you look at the production in the fourth quarter actually reaching the top end of our revised range, that's implementing of the fact that we put the number of wells on production we have planned, which is about 44 horizontal wells. But only way you can explain the fact that we're outperforming is these wells have very strong IP rates, as I have shown in prior slides. And so that gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. The horizontal production actually makes up more than half of our total production today in this basin about 60%. We see production drilling in the basin here about 30%. That's after a great year in 2015 of 27% by putting those 230 wells on production. The first quarter production volumes are going to be forecasted to be somewhat flat, and that's impacted by the fact that we have a great deal of expected shut in volumes, the fact we have offset fracs being 3x greater than occurred in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter. The reason for that is we're POPing these wells, we're fracking the wells near existing pads, and the objective is, of course, to save infrastructure cost. Of course, the second quarter should be a strong quarter for production. And we expect to POP a similar number of wells in the fourth quarter as we -- in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter about 45 wells. 
So I'll sum it up by saying these operating results give us a lot of confidence that this Spraberry/Wolfcamp assets can perform well, maybe in a depressed commodity price environment, which means we're poised to accelerate development of these assets when prices improve. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Rich for review of the fourth quarter financials and his outlook for the first quarter."

I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $13 million after-tax or $0.09. And had 2 unusual items th",985,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $13 million after-tax or $0.09. And had 2 unusual items there. The first that we mentioned -- both of which we mentioned in our January guidance that we provided an impairment on Eagle Ford Shale group properties, noncash of about $542 million after tax or $3.63 primarily as a reduction -- as a result of reduction commodity prices. And we had other noncash impairments, mainly vertical pipe inventory that were not using vertical drilling business, about $41 million or $0.27. So adjusting for those items, as Scott mentioned, we had a loss of $27 million adjusted or $0.18. 
Looking at the bottom of this slide where we showed how we performed against the updated guidance that we gave in early January in conjunction with the equity offering. You can see that all the items came in where we would have expected within guidance from the positive side of the guidance. The one item I'll make note of is our current income tax provision. We had a benefit of $26 million. That was really a result of a tax audit change that happened in December where they allowed bonus depreciation, which had the effect of reducing our 2015 estimate of alternative minimum tax, and so we did recognize that benefit. 
Turning to Slide 17. Looking at commodity prices. As you guys are well aware, they were down again in the fourth quarter where you see on our bar charts here that oil was down 11% to $37.92, NGLs was down 2% to $12.16 per barrel, and gas prices were down 20% to $2.03. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the benefit of our derivative positions in the fourth quarter. Once again adding significant cash to the company. Because of that position, we added about $281 million of cash flow in the Q4 related to our derivative position and about $875 million for the year. 
As we look forward, Scott mentioned we're 85% hedged in 2016 and 70% on gas. And that derivative portfolio at year end was valued at roughly $750 million, which happened to prices since year end, it's well over $800 million today. 
Turning to Slide 18 in production cost. A continuation of improvement here where our production cost for the quarter were $11.02, down about 5% from the third quarter. If you look at base LOE, it was also the main contributor where it was down 5% quarter-on-quarter. But probably more impressive is it was down 22% relative to the 2014 average. And so most of that is really just the company's cost-reduction initiatives throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our balance sheet in a more detail. At the end of the year, we had net debt at $2.3 billion. As Scott mentioned, probably in the position of the best balance sheet in the industry today. If you take into account the equity offering of $1.6 billion of proceeds, the incremental $500 million of proceeds from the EFS Midstream sale, that will give mid-year, and our net debt is basically $200 million at the end of the year. 
If you look at the maturity schedule there, you can see the 2016 and 2017 maturities, those are the ones that we prefunded back in December with -- on the chart here, the 2021 proceeds and the 2026. Probably an important thing here is we've reduced our interest rate as we paid those off by an order of magnitude of 2% in each of those cases. So overall, the company is with cash on the balance sheet, taking care of our near-term maturities, the equity offering, undrawn credit facility, we have a great liquidity position as we move into 2016 and '17. 
Turning to Slide 20. Looking at the first quarter guidance. Daily production, 211,000 to 216,000 BOEs a day. As Tim mentioned, that does reflect the higher shut-in volumes due to offset fracs as we're completing wells near existing infrastructure that have wells already connected to it. Production costs down slightly just to reflect our cost-reduction initiatives to $10.50 per BOE to $12.50 per BOE. Other one worth noting is DD&A, $18.50 per BOE to $20.50. Generally, you probably would expect that to be down a little bit more given the impairment charge, but I think it's important to note that our prove reserves that we calculate at the end of each quarter reflect a 12 -- trailing 12-month average prices. And as you're aware, prices continue to fall into that 12-month average will come down which will affect our end-of-life reserves, it will become uneconomic a little sooner. So I think will offset to a certain extent the impairment charge related to the Eagle Ford. 
Interest expense, higher, just reflecting the new bonds that there in there. Once we pay off the '16 and '17, that will drop back down to levels we've seen in past quarters. On other expense, $70 million to $80 million, that is up. Probably the big 3 components in there are: $20 million to $25 million of stacked drilling rig charges that we expect in the first quarter as a result of our rig reduction activities; we also have about $20 million to $25 million of unused transportation and gathering commitments in there; and then lastly, about $20 million related to the third-party component of our pressure pumping business that we recognized a loss on. That's principally non-cash due to depreciation on cash -- basing it on a cash basis, we're breakeven. The other items here are consistent we've had in prior quarters, so I won't go into those. And so with that, why don’t we stop there and we'll turn the call in -- or open the call for questions."

And I can tell you, it's not a cookie-cutter approach. All these rocks take different fracks, different ways. And so that's why we're a little hesitant to say definitively we have it all figured out because it's going to take a lot more time. And as I said on the call, we only have a limited data set really on the Wolfcamp A as an example. And for that matter, relatively limited data set on the Lower Spraberry Shale.

Obviously, be limiting the number of wells in the south, but our southern Wolfcamp A wells actually do range from 800,000 to 1 million BOE. That's why we have to range down that far. It will be very limited number of those wells drilled. So the vast majority of wells will be drilled would be 1 million barrel to 1.2 million or higher. So the reason we put the range in there simply is to make sure that we can cover all the different angles in the different zones. But I can assure you that our focus will be on the Wolfcamp B, as already mentioned, and the Wolfcamp A, and to a lesser extent, Lower Spraberry Shale. But all of those are shown on the prior graphs are well exceeding 1 million BOEs in most cases. And so do try to be conservative on this.

But I think we can get some reductions, perhaps 5% cost reductions. We don't have really baked in today as much as we expect  that to be in the future. So the numbers I gave you in the call or on my comments, 7.5 million to 8 million Permian wells is what we expect before any cost reductions so we can further extract. And so from that standpoint, we're not really baking in any cost savings. By the same token, the majority of the wells we'll drill will be -- what we focus on is 1 million to 1.2 million barrel wells, that's the kind of range we talked about, as you've seen and we've talked about. That's quite a large number of wells today which we think may exceed the 1.2 million, but the guidance we're utilizing and what we have baked in is -- depending about which zone you're talking about, 1 million to 1.2 million.

So in today's world, let's just say $17 per barrel. So the economics is we're getting trounced by the commodities on all 3 fronts. And that led to the decision.

So we are not standing path on the campaign optimization as I mentioned. We're now looking, for example, going into situations we might even have 15 foot cluster space. That will be unheard of in the past. We'll see how that does. We'll see how we do in terms of increasing our profit concentrations up to let's say 2,000 pounds per foot.

We had a fourth quarter adjusted loss of $27 million or $0.18 per share. Fourth quarter production, 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 53% oil, at the top end of our guidance -- revised guidance of 213,000 to 215,000. That's an increase of about 4,000 barrels a day or 2% versus the prior quarter. Full year production, 204,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 52% oil versus 48% in 2014. That's an increase of 22,000 barrels a day or 12% versus '14. Oil production was up 18,000 barrels a day or 21% versus 2014. Obviously, the growth was driven primarily by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin. 
Also, we delivered 273% drillbit reserve replacement of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent at a drillbit find -- F&D cost of about $10 per BOE. Again, shows you the true prolific nature of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp. With average operating cost of a typical Wolfcamp well of $5 and a finding cost of about $10, it still shows it's very economical in this today's environment to still be drilling in this play. 
Slide #4. We did place 44 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp during the fourth quarter. As expected, early production from 35 wells in the north and 9 wells in the south is exceeding expectations, as we had mentioned earlier in January, primarily due to company's completion optimization program. Also, continuing to strive toward great capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, really driven by service cost reductions, efficiency gains and completion optimization program. We did issue $500 million of 3.5% senior notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2026 in December to refund payment of our '16 and '17 maturities, and that'll be coming up over the next 12 months. 
Working with midstream partners to have our oil export facilities along the Gulf Coast operational by mid-2016. We did see the first cargo go out recently, not by us, by another producer. It's the first WTI cargo I saw. It went to the Caribbean and mixing with heavy Venezuelan crude. So people are starting to pay somewhat of a premium, so we hope we can get some crude out. The only crude that I've seen go out before that were a couple of the Eagle Ford oil cargoes from the Eagle Ford play from 2 other operators. 
But what's most important for us is that the long-term strip has narrowed to essentially nothing between Brent and WTI. 
On #5, our plan. Obviously, we made a change since early January. The primary reason for that change is that the entire strip for 2016 has dropped over $10 during that time frame, much faster than I had thought and we had thought at the management team, at the board level. So that's why we have developed this response to that. So we're reducing our horizontal drilling activity by 50% from 24 rigs down to 12 by mid-2016, while still growing production by 10%-plus and preserving the company's strong balance sheet and cash position. Eagle Ford will be going from 6 rigs to 0 during the first quarter. 2 rigs already released. Also in Eagle Ford, we will have 17 docks that we'll hold off and decide when prices come back, which I expect in 2017. Reducing southern Wolfcamp joint venture from 4 rigs to 0 by mid-2016. We'll be using the rest of our carry as the reason that we're running those rigs until mid-year to fully utilize the rest of the carry from south Wolfcamp. Reducing northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp from 14 to 12, really for capital preservation. Already released 1 rig. We were going back and forth between 12 and 14. We felt like that we wanted to get our capital budget down to about $2 billion. So there's no magic about it, but what's amazing is that we're still growing 50%, 10%-plus by cutting half of our rigs. A great accomplishment to the Permian team. Reallocating 2 Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Reduction in drilling activity and vertical integration spending results in capital expenditures of about $2 billion for '16, that's down from our preliminary forecast in early January from $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and from actual spending in 2015 of $2.2 billion. That's $1.85 billion for drilling. That does include tank batteries; SWDs, saltwater disposal wells; and gas processing facilities. And the additional $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. 
Slide #6, a continuation of our plan. We are probably the best-hedged company in regard to oil, again, for 2016. And we do have 20% for 2017. And we do have great gas coverage, 70% for 2016. Again, we have a great balance sheet, probably the best in the industry today. When you look at our $500 million coming due from enterprise and look at $400 million of cash on the balance sheet with additional $1.6 billion from our recent equity offering, we essentially have 0 debt today. So obviously, the best balance sheet among any major and any independent in the marketplace. And that's one of the reasons we decided to grow 10%-plus, and preserve roughly about $1.7 billion going into 2017. And if prices recover mid-'16, if they recover late 2016, they recover early '17, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else and get back to our 15% growth profile over the next several years. 
Slide #7 on Drilling and Completions capital. Capital program, again, of $2 billion. $1.85 billion, Drilling and Completion. As you can see, 90% of it's in the north. I won't go over the detail here, but any questions, you can please get Frank and Mike in the group calls afterwards. Other capital of $150 million, and again, the capital program funded from our cash flow, plus using a combination of our enterprise funds of $500 million coming midyear and $400 million in cash that we had at the end of the year in late 2015. 
Slide #8. Looking at -- going forward, you can see that we are growing 10%-plus. I still think that, that number is going to lead any company with oil production of any major and independent in the U.S. marketplace. We can -- again, we have the firepower to start it back up fairly quickly. We were looking at 224,000 barrels a day plus for the year 2016, going from 52% oil to 56% oil. You can see most of the pickup will be in the second, third and fourth quarters, as we have given out guidance of about 211,000 to 216,000 for the first quarter. And again long term, '16 to '18, we do show growth in this low strip price environment. '17 will be, again, around 10%, preserving over half of our cash of $1.7 billion by the end of '17. And so Pioneer can essentially weather '16 and '17 without increasing debt and be able to jumpstart at any point in time over the next 2 years as prices recover. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get in more detail about operations."

We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our Drilling and Completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quart",2122,"Thanks, Scott. We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our Drilling and Completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quarter. You can see the production profile in the chart below, as the dark blue line represents those wells' early production. And it's very clear when you look at that, that this is exceptionally strong production results we're seeing, the strongest to date in our program. And it's very clear that these wells are tracking well above that million barrel BOE type curve shown in the dash line. We did also put 2 Wolfcamp A wells on production right at the end of the year. Those are shown in the red line below on the graphs, you can see there's very little production data. The current thinking is that we'll be seeing more data as time goes on, but we're putting these wells on gas lift almost immediately. They had IP rates of about 1,570 barrels per day. Of course, early in the life of these wells. We'll be reporting more about those in the next quarter. 
When you look at the performance of the wells from the third quarter, it's very clear that we have similar results in the sense if you're looking at the 28 B wells and 2 A wells shown on the graph, 1 in light blue and the other in orange, respectively. Once again, we have a limited data set on A wells, only 2, but they're performing exceptionally well, well over the million barrel type curve. And when you look at the third quarter B wells, they also performed exceptionally well. So what you can also see from this graph is we're improving quarter-to-quarter sequentially in terms of the performance of these wells. And it has to do, with a great extent, related to our completion optimization program. About 2/3 of the wells in the third quarter were subject to completion optimization, and all of the fourth quarter wells were exposed to completion optimization. And so you can see the uplift we're generating as a result of optimizing these wells. 
When I talk about optimization, it's several different factors that we're testing in various different areas. For example, generally, we're changing the stage lengths from 240 feet to 150 feet. We're changing the clusters per stage, generally, from 4 to 5. We're pumping more fluid, somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 barrels per foot compared to the prior 30 barrels per foot. And importantly, we've increased the same concentrations for these wells in the fourth quarter, up to about 1,500 pounds per foot from a total of about 1,100 from prior completions. We're going to outline a little bit later on this slide deck the expansion of some of these ideas even through further optimization in our '16 campaign. I would say, as we're pointing out, if you look at the table below that, of the 22 Wolfcamp B wells put on production, they average exceedingly strong IPs of 2,200 barrels per day on a BOE basis. And that compares with 1,900 in terms of the campaign from the third quarter. So a dramatic increase as we continue to see -- as completion optimization is paying off very well. 
Turning now to Slide 10. We've seen similar successes in the Lower Spraberry Shale, where we POP'd 11 wells during the quarter. The early production results, as you can see on the graph, are close to that same 1 million barrel EUR type curve. And we did completion optimizations on 9 of the 11 wells. And essentially using the exact same style of frac optimization -- completion optimization that I mentioned regarding the Wolfcamp zones. The production on some of these wells is really continuing to build. In fact, only 5 out of these 11 wells have actually reached their IP rates. They're continuing to build, not atypical for Lower Spraberry Shale wells. As we take the water off the system, oil rates increase and peak quite a long ways into the early production life. So we'll be having more to report regarding these wells as we see their IPs and can incorporate that into the first quarter report. 
Turning to Slide 11. Once again, we're seeing strong results in the south, with the JV area of the Wolfcamp, where we're using essentially the same optimization techniques. We placed 9 wells on production in the southern Wolfcamp area. Of the 8 Wolfcamp B wells, you can see on the graph below, particularly on the left blue line, tracking above 1 million barrel type curve, and the Wolfcamp A well that was drilled, 1 of the 9 wells, shown in the red curve in the right, is tracking between 800,000 BOE and 1 million BOE in terms of its type curve. So these are very good wells on the south, and you can see these various areas in the south are going to compete very well with the north. Again, all of these were optimized using similar optimization packages, as we had discussed earlier in the prior slides. 
Now then turning to Slide 12. The optimization and productivity gains I've already mentioned are leading to a high level of capital efficiency. And that's critical, of course, when we're faced with a low commodity price environment, as we see today. You can see on our left graph here that we continue to see dramatic improvements when it comes to our drilling campaign and completion campaigns, where we're dropping our costs dramatically sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. We've decreased our cost for D&C in the north B wells by an average of about 30% over the last year, which is really phenomenal result. At the same time, as you see the curves on the right, we're seeing sequential increases in cumulative production per well as we go through time. That is reflected in the prior slides that I've already mentioned. But you can see it pretty dramatically here that on a 90-day average rate, our production is up from about 830 BOE per day in 2014's fourth quarter to 1,250 in this last fourth quarter. So -- and it's pretty clear if you look at data that IPs are well correlated to well EURs. And so you can see we've had a dramatic improvement as a result of our capital efficiency and optimization programs. So it does give us confidence that we are, in fact, increasing capital efficiency through time and that allows us to continue drilling today, albeit at a slower rate based on the commodity price deck. 
Turning to Slide 13. And this is now reflecting on the 2016 campaign for the Spraberry/Wolfcamp B and C budget. As Scott's already mentioned some of this, I'll be brief. We are going to be moving to 12 rigs in the north, as he said, 0 in the south and expect, in doing so, to still place 230 wells on production this year, split 60% Wolfcamp B and the balance being Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry Shales. About 190 wells in the north and 40 in the south. And despite the fact we've had weak commodity prices, as I mentioned earlier, we are still generating good returns on the wells we're drilling. The optimization campaign is certainly helping that. Now what we're planning on doing in certain areas is actually furthering that optimization campaign to, for example, in some areas, actually reduce the stage lengths of the -- cluster lengths to about 15 feet and 10 clusters per stage. We're looking at increasing the fluid utilization up to about 50 barrels per foot, and increasing our sand concentrations up to 1,700 to 2,000 pounds per foot. At the same time, we continue to experiment with less coarse sand concentration, so 40/70 sand and 100 mesh sand. And in doing so, we can put more of a focus on slickwater fluid utilization versus gels. We're also, in all these areas, adjusting spacing and stacking as we learn more in each area. We really are still heavily in the process of learning the best way to complete the wells. And it's not the case that it's the same in every area for every zone. So we are going to learn a lot this year and it's one of the benefits of continuing a drilling campaign. Costs are coming in at about $7.5 million to $8 million, that's based on a 9,000-foot lateral, and incorporates the optimized completions cost. And the program that we're talking about in terms of production growth, we're incorporating EURs that range, depending upon the zone, from 800,000 BOE to about 1.2 million BOE based on -- depending on which zone we're dealing with. And we have IRRs in this campaign, even at current strip prices, that are up to 30%. As Scott already mentioned, with our cost being low to develop this production and with operating cost being low, returns are very solid. 
Turning now to Slide 14. We continue to build out the required infrastructure, albeit at a slower rate of spending based on what's going on with the price downturn. In terms of tank batteries and saltwater disposal facilities, we'll spend about $170 million this year. In doing so, we're reducing our cost per well that's hooked up and put on production from about $900,000 to about $750,000 this year. That's a benefit of the scales coming from the effect of our prior spending on centralization of the facilities. And so we're beginning to see the benefits that come from pre-planning and pre-spending in the form of reduced cost of wells up. We'll spend about $45 million in gas processing. The most important part of that is completing the Buffalo plant in Martin County in the second quarter this year. There are no new plants after that in the foreseeable future. We did announce the start-up of a 20-mile pipeline to deliver effluent water, nonpotable water from the City of Odessa to our similar Midland County drilling locations, and that's going to save us a tremendous sum about -- we calculated $100,000 per well once this water starts being utilized. It just started flowing last week. We will also spend about $45 million-or-so when it comes to mainline expansions and other subsystems. And just like the Odessa deal, we continued to pursue purchasing from the city of Midland effluent water in a similar way. Those negotiations continue. 
Finally, on this slide, the completion of the expansion on Brady sand mine has been postponed, as you might expect, until we're at a point we're going to be adding more rigs.
Turning then to Slide 15. We certainly have begun to see the effects of the strong well results I showed in the form of production. If you look at the production in the fourth quarter, actually reaching the top end of our revised range, that's emblematic of the fact that we put the number of wells on production we had planned, which is about 44 horizontal wells. But the only way you can explain the fact that we're outperforming is these wells have very strong IP rates, as I showed on prior slides. And so that gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. The horizontal production actually makes up more than half of our total production today in this basin, about 60%. We see production drilling in the basin here about 30%. That's after a great year in 2015 of 27% by putting those 230 wells on production. The first quarter production volumes are going to be forecasted to be somewhat flat, and that's -- they're impacted by the fact that we have a great deal of expected shut-in volumes, the fact we have offset fracs being 3x greater than occurred in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. The reason for that is we're POP-ing these wells, we're fracking the wells near existing pads, and the objective is, of course, to save infrastructure cost. Of course, the second quarter should be a strong quarter for production. And we expect to POP a similar number of wells in the fourth quarter as we -- in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, about 45 wells. 
So I'll sum it up by saying these operating results give us a lot of confidence that these Spraberry/Wolfcamp assets can perform well even in a depressed commodity price environment, which means we're poised to accelerate development of these assets when prices improve. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Rich for a review of the fourth quarter financials and his outlook for the first quarter."

I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17.

I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $13 million after-tax or $0.09. And it had 2 unusual items there. The first, we had mentioned in our -- both of which we mentioned in our January guidance that we provided, an impairment on Eagle Ford Shale proved properties noncash of about $542 million after tax or $3.63, primarily as a reduction -- as a result of the reduction in commodity prices. And we had other noncash impairments, mainly vertical pipe inventory that we're not using because we're out of the vertical drilling business, of about $41 million or $0.27. So adjusting for those items, as Scott mentioned, we had a loss of $27 million adjusted or $0.18. 
Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show how we've performed against the updated guidance that we gave in early January in conjunction with the equity offering. You can see that all the items came in where we would've expected within guidance, around the positive side of the guidance. The one item I'll make note of is our current income tax provision. We had a benefit of $26 million. That was really a result of a tax audit change that happened in December, where they allowed bonus depreciation, which had the effect of reducing our 2015 estimate of alternative minimum tax, and so we did recognize that benefit. 
Turning to Slide 17. Looking at commodity prices. As you guys are well aware, they were down again in the fourth quarter, where you see on our bar charts here that oil was down 11% to $37.92, NGLs was down 2% to $12.16 per barrel and gas prices were down 20% to $2.03. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the benefit of our derivative positions in the fourth quarter, once again adding significant cash to the company. Because of that position, we added about $281 million of cash flow in the Q4 related to our derivative position and about $875 million for the year. 
As we look forward, Scott mentioned we're 85% hedged in 2016 and 70% on gas. And that derivative portfolio at year end was valued at roughly $750 million which, with what happened to prices since year end, it's well over $800 million today. 
Turning to Slide 18 and production costs. A continuation of improvement here, where our production costs for the quarter were $11.02, down about 5% from the third quarter. If you look at base LOE, it was also the main contributor where it was down 5% quarter-on-quarter. But probably more impressive is it was down 22% relative to the 2014 average. And so most of that is really just the company's cost reduction initiatives throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our balance sheet in a little more detail. At the end of the year, we had net debt at $2.3 billion. As Scott mentioned, probably in the position of the best balance sheet in the industry today. If you take into account the equity offering of $1.6 billion of proceeds, the incremental $500 million of proceeds from the EFS midstream sale that we did mid-year, our net debt is basically $200 million at the end of the year. 
If you look at the maturity schedule there, you can see the 2016 and 2017 maturities, those are the ones that we prefunded back in December with, on the chart here, the 2021 proceeds and the 2026. Probably an important thing here is that we've reduced our interest rate as we pay those off by an order of magnitude of 2% in each of those cases. So overall, the company is -- with cash on the balance sheet, taking care of our near-term maturities, the equity offering, undrawn credit facility, we have a great liquidity position as we move into 2016 and '17. 
Turning to Slide 20. Looking at first quarter guidance. Daily production, 211,000 to 216,000 BOEs a day. As Tim mentioned, that does reflect the higher shut-in volumes due to offset fracs as we're completing wells near existing infrastructure that have wells already connected to it. Production costs, down slightly just to reflect our cost-reduction initiatives, $10.50 per BOE to $12.50 per BOE. Other one worth noting is DD&A, $18.50 per BOE to $20.50. Generally, you probably would expect that to be down a bit more, given the impairment charge. But I think it's important to note that our proved reserves that we calculate at the end of each quarter reflect a 12 -- trailing 12-month average prices. And as you're aware, prices continue to fall, and so that 12-month average will come down, which will affect our -- some of our end-of-life reserves, that'll become uneconomic a little sooner. So I think that offsets, to a certain extent, the impairment charge related to the Eagle Ford. 
Interest expense, higher, just reflecting the new bonds that are in there. Once we pay off the '16 and '17, that will drop back down to levels we've seen in past quarters. On other expense, $70 million to $80 million, that is up. Probably the 3 big components in there are: $20 million to $25 million of stacked drilling rig charges that we expect in the first quarter as a result of our rig reduction activities; we also have about $20 million to $25 million of unused transportation and gathering commitments in there; and then lastly, about $20 million related to the third-party component of our pressure pumping business that we recognized a loss on. That's principally noncash due to depreciation. On a -- basically, on a cash basis, we're breakeven. The other items here are consistent with what we've had in prior quarters, so I won't go into those. 
And so with that, why don't we stop there and we'll turn the call in -- or open the call up for questions."

But to the extent we're drilling Wolfcamp A intervals, I mentioned on the call that we're in the range of peers -- this is in the south I'm talking about. We'll obviously be limiting the number of wells in the south, but our southern Wolfcamp A wells actually do range from 800,000 to 1 million BOE. That's why we have the range down that far. There'll be a very limited number of those wells drilled, however. So the vast majority of wells that will be drilled will be 1 million barrel to 1.2 million or higher. So the reason we put the range in there simply is to make sure that we can cover all the different angles in the different zones. But I can assure you that our focus will be on the Wolfcamp B, as already mentioned; and the Wolfcamp A; and to a lesser extent, Lower Spraberry Shale. But all of those, as shown on the prior graphs, are well exceeding 1 million BOEs in most cases. And so we do try to be conservative on this. The returns, I think, are roughly in that 30% range today based on strip prices. And there's some numbers slightly above and slightly below.

At the time, during the call, remember we talked about reducing it to 4 and with the potential to reduce it lower. So obviously, today, in today's world, Eagle Ford production will be declining. It's simply a product of the fact that there's -- in our areas, particularly, there's quite a lot of NGLs and natural gas in the flow stream as well as the fact that condensate in our area fetches a price which is generally going to be $10 off of WTI. So in today's world, let's just say $17 per barrel. So the economics is we're getting trounced by the commodities on all 3 fronts. And that led to the decision. By the same token, if you look at Permian, however, the Permian assets pretty clearly are continuing to outperform. I would expect that to be the same going forward as we put our team of geoscientists and engineers to work in the laboratory, understanding how to complete all these wells optimally. And that's what's going to happen. So it's a nice trade to be able to take monies out of Eagle Ford, where the economics are not very good today and put them in an area that's outperforming."

I think you have to focus on the fact that even in 2016, we're changing what we're doing in terms of optimization. We're pushing the limits. So we're not standing pat on the '15 campaign optimization as I mentioned. We're now looking at, for example, going into a situation where we might even have 15-foot cluster space. That would be unheard of in the past. We'll see how that does. We'll see how we do in terms of increasing our proppant concentrations up to, let's say, 2,000 pounds per foot. We'll see how we do in terms of spacing and stacking situations in different zones. So I would say we're still pretty early days. We're still improving and we're still learning with every well.

We had a fourth quarter adjusted loss of $27 million or $0.18 per share. Fourth quarter production, 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 53% oil, at the top end of our guidance -- revised guidance of 213,000 to 215,000. That's an increase of about 4,000 barrels a day or 2% versus the prior quarter. Full year production, 204,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 52% oil versus 48% in 2014. That's an increase of 22,000 barrels a day or 12% versus '14. Oil production was up 18,000 barrels a day or 21% versus 2014. Obviously, the growth was driven primarily by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin. 
Also, we delivered 273% drillbit reserve replacement of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent at a drillbit find -- F&D cost of about $10 per BOE. Again, shows you the true prolific nature of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp. With average operating cost of a typical Wolfcamp well of $5 and a finding cost of about $10, it still shows it's very economical in this today's environment to still be drilling in this play. 
Slide #4. We did place 44 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp during the fourth quarter. As expected, early production from 35 wells in the north and 9 wells in the south is exceeding expectations, as we had mentioned earlier in January, primarily due to company's completion optimization program. Also, continuing to strive toward great capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, really driven by service cost reductions, efficiency gains and completion optimization program. We did issue $500 million of 3.5% senior notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2026 in December to refund payment of our '16 and '17 maturities, and that'll be coming up over the next 12 months. 
Working with midstream partners to have our oil export facilities along the Gulf Coast operational by mid-2016. We did see the first cargo go out recently, not by us, by another producer. It's the first WTI cargo I saw. It went to the Caribbean and mixing with heavy Venezuelan crude. So people are starting to pay somewhat of a premium, so we hope we can get some crude out. The only crude that I've seen go out before that were a couple of the Eagle Ford oil cargoes from the Eagle Ford play from 2 other operators. 
But what's most important for us is that the long-term strip has narrowed to essentially nothing between Brent and WTI. 
On #5, our plan. Obviously, we made a change since early January. The primary reason for that change is that the entire strip for 2016 has dropped over $10 during that time frame, much faster than I had thought and we had thought at the management team, at the board level. So that's why we have developed this response to that. So we're reducing our horizontal drilling activity by 50% from 24 rigs down to 12 by mid-2016, while still growing production by 10%-plus and preserving the company's strong balance sheet and cash position. Eagle Ford will be going from 6 rigs to 0 during the first quarter. 2 rigs already released. Also in Eagle Ford, we will have 17 docks that we'll hold off and decide when prices come back, which I expect in 2017. Reducing southern Wolfcamp joint venture from 4 rigs to 0 by mid-2016. We'll be using the rest of our carry as the reason that we're running those rigs until mid-year to fully utilize the rest of the carry from south Wolfcamp. Reducing northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp from 14 to 12 rigs, really for capital preservation. Already released 1 rig. We were going back and forth between 12 and 14 rigs. We felt like that we wanted to get our capital budget down to about $2 billion. So there's no magic about it, but what's amazing is that we're still growing 50%, 10%-plus by cutting half of our rigs. A great accomplishment to the Permian team. Reallocating 2 Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Reduction in drilling activity and vertical integration spending results in capital expenditures of about $2 billion for '16, that's down from our preliminary forecast in early January from $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and from actual spending in 2015 of $2.2 billion. That's $1.85 billion for drilling. That does include tank batteries; SWDs, saltwater disposal wells; and gas processing facilities. And the additional $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. 
Slide #6, a continuation of our plan. We are probably the best-hedged company in regard to oil, again, for 2016. And we do have 20% for 2017. And we do have great gas coverage, 70% for 2016. Again, we have a great balance sheet, probably the best in the industry today. When you look at our $500 million coming due from Enterprise and look at $400 million of cash on the balance sheet with additional $1.6 billion from our recent equity offering, we essentially have 0 debt today. So obviously, the best balance sheet among any major and any independent in the marketplace. And that's one of the reasons we decided to grow 10%-plus, and preserve roughly about $1.7 billion going into 2017. And if prices recover mid-'16, if they recover late 2016, they recover early '17, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else and get back to our 15% growth profile over the next several years. 
Slide #7 on Drilling and Completions capital. Capital program, again, of $2 billion. $1.85 billion, Drilling and Completion. As you can see, 90% of it's in the north. I won't go over the detail here, but any questions, you can please get Frank and Mike in the group calls afterwards. 
Other capital of $150 million, and again, the capital program funded from our cash flow, plus using a combination of our Enterprise funds of $500 million coming midyear and $400 million in cash that we had at the end of the year in late 2015. 
Slide #8. Looking at -- going forward, you can see that we are growing 10%-plus. I still think that, that number is going to lead any company with oil production of any major and independent in the U.S. marketplace. We can -- again, we have the firepower to start it back up fairly quickly. We were looking at 224,000 barrels a day plus for the year 2016, going from 52% oil to 56% oil. You can see most of the pickup will be in the second, third and fourth quarters, as we have given out guidance of about 211,000 to 216,000 for the first quarter. And again long term, '16 to '18, we do show growth in this low strip price environment. '17 will be, again, around 10%, preserving over half of our cash of $1.7 billion by the end of '17. And so Pioneer can essentially weather '16 and '17 without increasing debt and be able to jumpstart at any point in time over the next 2 years as prices recover. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get in more detail about operations."

We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our Drilling and Completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quart",2126,"Thanks, Scott. We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our Drilling and Completion program in the Midland Basin. I'll start here on Slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quarter. You can see the production profile in the chart below, as the dark blue line represents those wells' early production. And it's very clear when you look at that, that this is exceptionally strong production results we're seeing, the strongest to date in our program. And it's very clear that these wells are tracking well above that million barrel BOE type curve shown in the dash line. We did also put 2 Wolfcamp A wells on production right at the end of the year. Those are shown in the red line below on the graph, so you can see there's very little production data. The current thinking is that we'll be seeing more data as time goes on, but we're putting these wells on gas lift almost immediately. They had IP rates of about 1,570 barrels per day. Of course, early in the life of these wells. We'll be reporting more about those in the next quarter. 
When you look at the performance of the wells from the third quarter, it's very clear that we have similar results in the sense if you're looking at the 28 B wells and 2 A wells shown on the graph, 1 in light blue and the other in orange, respectively. Once again, we have a limited data set on A wells, only 2, but they're performing exceptionally well, well over the million barrel type curve. And when you look at the third quarter B wells, they also performed exceptionally well. So what you can also see from this graph is we're improving quarter-to-quarter sequentially in terms of the performance of these wells. And it has to do, with a great extent, related to our completion optimization program. About 2/3 of the wells in the third quarter were subject to completion optimization, and all of the fourth quarter wells were exposed to completion optimization. And so you can see the uplift we're generating as a result of optimizing these wells. 
When I talk about optimization, it's several different factors that we're testing in various different areas. For example, generally, we're changing the stage lengths from 240 feet to 150 feet. We're changing the clusters per stage, generally, from 4 to 5. We're pumping more fluid, somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 barrels per foot compared to the prior 30 barrels per foot. And importantly, we've increased the sand concentrations for these wells in the fourth quarter, up to about 1,500 pounds per foot from a total of about 1,100 from prior completions. We're going to outline a little bit later on this slide deck the expansion of some of these ideas even through further optimization in our '16 campaign. I would say, it's worth pointing out, if you look at the table below that, of the 22 Wolfcamp B wells put on production, they average exceedingly strong IPs of 2,200 barrels per day on a BOE basis. And that compares with 1,900 in terms of the campaign from the third quarter. So a dramatic increase as we continue to see -- as completion optimization is paying off very well. 
Turning now to Slide 10. We've seen similar successes in the Lower Spraberry Shale, where we POP'd 11 wells during the quarter. The early production results, as you can see on the graph, are close to that same 1 million barrel EUR type curve. And we did completion optimizations on 9 of the 11 wells. And essentially using the exact same style of frac optimization -- completion optimization that I mentioned regarding the Wolfcamp zones. The production on some of these wells is really continuing to build. In fact, only 5 out of these 11 wells have actually reached their IP rates. They're continuing to build, not atypical for Lower Spraberry Shale wells. As we take the water off the system, oil rates increase and peak quite a long ways into the early production life. So we'll be having more to report regarding these wells as we see their IPs and can incorporate that into the first quarter report. 
Turning to Slide 11. Once again, we're seeing strong results in the south, with the JV area of the Wolfcamp, where we're using essentially the same optimization techniques. We placed 9 wells on production in the southern Wolfcamp area. Of the 8 Wolfcamp B wells, you can see on the graph below, particularly on the left blue line, tracking above 1 million barrel type curve, and the Wolfcamp A well that was drilled, 1 of the 9 wells, shown in the red curve in the right, is tracking between 800,000 BOE and 1 million BOE in terms of its type curve. So these are very good wells on the south, and you can see there's various areas of the south are going to compete very well with the north. Again, all of these were optimized using similar optimization packages, as we had discussed earlier in the prior slides. 
Now then turning to Slide 12. The optimization and productivity gains I've already mentioned are leading to a high level of capital efficiency. And that's critical, of course, when we're faced with a low commodity price environment, as we see today. You can see on our left graph here that we continue to see dramatic improvements when it comes to our drilling campaign and completion campaigns, where we are dropping our costs dramatically sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. We've decreased our cost for D&C in the north B wells by an average of about 30% over the last year, which is really phenomenal result. At the same time, as you see the curves on the right, we're seeing sequential increases in cumulative production per well as we go through time. That is reflected in the prior slides that I've already mentioned. But you can see it pretty dramatically here that on a 90-day average rate, our production is up from about 830 BOE per day in 2014's fourth quarter to 1,250 in this last fourth quarter. So -- and it's pretty clear if you look at data that IPs are well correlated to well EURs. And so you can see we've had a dramatic improvement as a result of our capital efficiency and optimization programs. So it does give us confidence that we are, in fact, increasing capital efficiency through time and that allows us to continue drilling today, albeit at a slower rate based on the commodity price deck. 
Turning to Slide 13. And this is now reflecting on the 2016 campaign for the Spraberry/Wolfcamp D&C budget. As Scott's already mentioned some of this, so I'll be brief. We are going to be moving to 12 rigs in the north as he said, 0 in the south and expect, in doing so, to still place 230 wells on production this year, split 60% Wolfcamp B and the balance being Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry Shales. About 190 wells in the north and 40 in the south. And despite the fact we've had weak commodity prices, as I mentioned earlier, we are still generating good returns on the wells we're drilling. The optimization campaign is certainly helping that. Now what we're planning on doing in certain areas is actually furthering that optimization campaign to, for example, in some areas, actually reduce the stage lengths of the -- cluster lengths to about 15 feet and 10 clusters per stage. We're looking at increasing the fluid utilization up to about 50 barrels per foot, and increasing our sand concentrations up to 1,700 to 2,000 pounds per foot. At the same time, we continue to experiment with less coarse sand concentration, so 40/70 sand and 100 mesh sand. And in doing so, we can put more of a focus on slickwater fluid utilization versus gels. We're also, in all these areas, adjusting spacing and stacking as we learn more in each area. We really are still heavily in the process of learning the best way to complete the wells. And it's not the case that it's the same in every area for every zone. So we are going to learn a lot this year and it's one of the benefits of continuing a drilling campaign. Costs are coming in at about $7.5 million to $8 million, that's based on a 9,000-foot lateral, and incorporates the optimized completions cost. And the program that we're talking about in terms of production growth, we're incorporating EURs that range, depending upon the zone, from 800,000 BOE to about 1.2 million BOE based on -- depending on which zone we're dealing with. And we have IRRs in this campaign, even at current strip prices, that are up to 30%. As Scott already mentioned, with our cost being low to develop this production and with operating cost being low, returns are very solid. 
Turning now to Slide 14. We continue to build out the required infrastructure, albeit at a slower rate of spending based on what's going on with the price downturn. In terms of tank batteries and saltwater disposal facilities, we'll spend about $170 million this year. In doing so, we're reducing our cost per well that's hooked up and put on production from about $900,000 to about $750,000 this year. That's a benefit of the scales coming from the effect of our prior spending on centralization of the facilities. And so we're beginning to see the benefits that come from pre-planning and pre-spending in the form of reduced cost to hook wells up. We'll spend about $45 million in gas processing. The most important part of that is completing the Buffalo plant in Martin County in the second quarter this year. There are no new plants after that in the foreseeable future. We did announce the start-up of a 20-mile pipeline to deliver effluent water, nonpotable water from the City of Odessa to some of our similar Midland County drilling locations, and that's going to save us a tremendous sum about -- we calculated $100,000 per well once this water starts being utilized. It just started flowing last week. We will also spend about $45 million-or-so when it comes to mainline expansions and other subsystems. And just like the Odessa deal, we continue to pursue purchasing from the city of Midland effluent water in a similar way. Those negotiations continue. 
Finally, on this slide, the completion of the expansion on Brady sand mine has been postponed, as you might expect, until we're at a point we're going to be adding more rigs.
Turning then to Slide 15. We certainly have begun to see the effects of the strong well results I showed in the form of production. If you look at the production in the fourth quarter, actually reaching the top end of our revised range, that's emblematic of the fact that we put the number of wells on production we had planned, which is about 44 horizontal wells. But the only way you can explain the fact that we're outperforming is these wells have very strong IP rates, as I showed on prior slides. And so that gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. The horizontal production actually makes up more than half of our total production today in this basin, about 60%. We see production drilling in the basin here about 30%. That's after a great year in 2015 of 27% by putting those 230 wells on production. The first quarter production volumes are going to be forecasted to be somewhat flat, and that's -- they're impacted by the fact that we have a great deal of expected shut-in volumes, the fact we have offset fracs being 3x greater than occurred in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. The reason for that is we're POP-ing these wells, we're fracking the wells near existing pads, and the objective is, of course, to save infrastructure costs. Of course, the second quarter should be a strong quarter for production. And we expect to POP a similar number of wells in the fourth quarter as we -- in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, about 45 wells. 
So I'll sum it up by saying these operating results give us a lot of confidence that these Spraberry/Wolfcamp assets can perform well even in a depressed commodity price environment, which means we're poised to accelerate development of these assets when prices improve. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Rich for a review of the fourth quarter financials and his outlook for the first quarter."

I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17.

I'm going to start on Slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million or $4.17. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $13 million after-tax or $0.09. And had 2 unusual items there. The first, we had mentioned in our -- both of which we mentioned in our January guidance that we provided, an impairment on Eagle Ford Shale proved properties, noncash, of about $542 million after tax or $3.63, primarily as a reduction -- as a result of the reduction in commodity prices. And we had other noncash impairments, mainly vertical pipe inventory that we're not using because we're out of the vertical drilling business, of about $41 million or $0.27. So adjusting for those items, as Scott mentioned, we had a loss of $27 million adjusted, or $0.18. 
Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show how we've performed against the updated guidance that we gave in early January in conjunction with the equity offering. You can see that all the items came in where we would've expected within guidance or on the positive side of the guidance. The one item I'll make note of is our current income tax provision. We had a benefit of $26 million. That was really a result of a tax law that -- change that happened in December, where they allowed bonus depreciation, which had the effect of reducing our 2015 estimate of alternative minimum tax, and so we did recognize that benefit. 
Turning to Slide 17. Looking at commodity prices. As you guys are well aware, they were down again in the fourth quarter, where you see on our bar charts here that oil was down 11% to $37.92, NGLs was down 2% to $12.16 per barrel and gas prices were down 20% to $2.03. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the benefit of our derivative positions in the fourth quarter, once again adding significant cash to the company. Because of that position, we added about $281 million of cash flow in the Q4 related to our derivative position and about $875 million for the year. 
As we look forward, Scott mentioned we're 85% hedged in 2016 and 70% on gas. And that derivative portfolio at year end was valued at roughly $750 million which, with what happened to prices since year end, it's well over $800 million today. 
Turning to Slide 18 and production costs. A continuation of improvement here, where our production costs for the quarter were $11.02, down about 5% from the third quarter. If you look at base LOE, it was also the main contributor where it was down 5% quarter-on-quarter. But probably more impressive is it was down 22% relative to the 2014 average. And so most of that is really just the company's cost reduction initiatives throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our balance sheet in a little more detail. At the end of the year we had net debt at $2.3 billion. As Scott mentioned, probably in the position of the best balance sheet in the industry today. If you take into account the equity offering of $1.6 billion of proceeds, the incremental $500 million of proceeds from the EFS midstream sale that we'll get mid-year, our net debt is basically $200 million at the end of the year. 
If you look at the maturity schedule there, you can see the 2016 and 2017 maturities, those are the ones that we prefunded back in December with, on the chart here, the 2021 proceeds and the 2026. Probably an important thing here is that we've reduced our interest rate as we pay those off by an order of magnitude of 2% in each of those cases. So overall, the company is -- with cash on the balance sheet, taking care of our near-term maturities, the equity offering, undrawn credit facility, we have a great liquidity position as we move into 2016 and '17. 
Turning to Slide 20. Looking at first quarter guidance. Daily production, 211,000 to 216,000 BOEs a day. As Tim mentioned, that does reflect the higher shut-in volumes due to offset fracs as we're completing wells near existing infrastructure that have wells already connected to it. Production costs, down slightly just to reflect our cost-reduction initiatives, $10.50 per BOE to $12.50 per BOE. Other one worth noting is DD&A, $18.50 per BOE to $20.50. Generally, you probably would expect that to be down a bit more, given the impairment charge. But I think it's important to note that our proved reserves that we calculate at the end of each quarter reflect a 12 -- trailing 12-month average prices. And as you're aware, prices continue to fall, and so that 12-month average will come down, which will affect our -- some of our end-of-life reserves, it'll become uneconomic a little sooner. So I think that offsets, to a certain extent, the impairment charge related to the Eagle Ford. 
Interest expense, higher, just reflecting the new bonds that are in there. Once we pay off the '16 and '17, that will drop back down to levels we've seen in past quarters. On other expense, $70 million to $80 million, that is up. Probably the 3 big components in there are: $20 million to $25 million of stacked drilling rig charges that we expect in the first quarter as a result of our rig reduction activities; we also have about $20 million to $25 million of unused transportation and gathering commitments in there; and then lastly, about $20 million related to the third-party component of our pressure pumping business that we recognized a loss on. That's principally noncash due to depreciation. On a -- basically, on a cash basis, we're breakeven. The other items here are consistent with what we've had in prior quarters, so I won't go into those. 
And so with that, why don't we stop there and we'll turn the call in -- or open the call up for questions."

But to the extent we're drilling Wolfcamp A intervals, I mentioned on the call that we're in the range of peers -- this is in the south I'm talking about. We'll obviously be limiting the number of wells in the south, but our southern Wolfcamp A wells actually do range from 800,000 to 1 million BOE. That's why we have the range down that far. There'll be a very limited number of those wells drilled, however. So the vast majority of wells that will be drilled will be 1 million barrel to 1.2 million or higher. So the reason we put the range in there simply is to make sure that we can cover all the different angles in the different zones. But I can assure you that our focus will be on the Wolfcamp B, as already mentioned; and the Wolfcamp A; and to a lesser extent, Lower Spraberry Shale. But all of those, as shown on the prior graphs, are well exceeding 1 million BOEs in most cases. And so we do try to be conservative on this. The returns, I think, are roughly in that 30% range today based on strip prices. And there's some numbers slightly above and slightly below.

At the time, during the call, remember we talked about reducing it to 4 and with the potential to reduce it lower. So obviously, today, in today's world, Eagle Ford production will be declining. It's simply a product of the fact that there's -- in our areas, particularly, there's quite a lot of NGLs and natural gas in the flow stream as well as the fact that condensate in our area fetches a price which is generally going to be $10 off of WTI. So in today's world, let's just say $17 per barrel. So the economics is we're getting trounced by the commodities on all 3 fronts. And that led to the decision. 
By the same token, if you look at Permian, however, the Permian assets pretty clearly are continuing to outperform. I would expect that to be the same going forward as we put our team of geoscientists and engineers to work in the laboratory, understanding how to complete all these wells optimally. And that's what's going to happen. So it's a nice trade to be able to take monies out of Eagle Ford, where the economics are not very good today and put them in an area that's outperforming."

I think you have to focus on the fact that even in 2016, we're changing what we're doing in terms of optimization. We're pushing the limits. So we're not standing pat on the '15 campaign optimization as I mentioned. We're now looking at, for example, going into a situation where we might even have 15-foot cluster spacing. That would be unheard of in the past. We'll see how that does. We'll see how we do in terms of increasing our proppant concentrations up to, let's say, 2,000 pounds per foot. We'll see how we do in terms of spacing and stacking situations in different zones. So I would say we're still pretty early days. We're still improving and we're still learning with every well.

Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,0",1121,"Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 55% oil. So we're well along on our movement from 52% to 56% oil from '15 to '16. Way above Pioneer's guidance range of 211,000 barrels a day equivalent to 216,000, an increase of 7,000 barrels a day equivalent or 3% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Oil production is up 10,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Obviously, driven by the growth of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. 
What's also a milestone for the company, our gross production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp fields exceeded 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for the first time, and total field production has exceeded the surpassed 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and still growing, probably the only field growing in today's environment in North America. 
We placed 55 horizontal wells on production in Spraberry/Wolfcamp field during the first quarter. All wells benefited from completion optimization, which Tim will give you a lot more detail. 
Continuing to rely significant capital efficiency gains in the field, both with the optimization program, longer lateral lengths, increasing and enhancing well productivity. Drilling and Completion efficiencies and cost-reduction initiatives are still driving down our cost per lateral foot. 
What's also more important again, reducing our combined production cost and G&A expense for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 15%. We continue over the next several quarters continue to see continued improvement in regard to those numbers. 
We also added the recently Targa-operated Spraberry/Wolfcamp gas processing plant of 200 million a day. It's online. Essentially is up about 120 million a day, a decade from other plants, which reduced their intake in those other plants, so there's plenty of room to the next 2 or 3 years for additional capacity. 
Pioneer, just to remind people, we do own 27% of this system. 
Increased oil and gas derivative coverage for '17. We've already released these numbers, and we'll talk a bit more about all hedges up primarily 50% for 2017. 
Slide #4, on our outlook. We plan to maintain our 12 horizontal rigs in the North Spraberry/Wolfcamp field based on favorable returns in the area. We're currently operating 12 horizontal rigs in the North and 2 in the South. The 2 in the South will be terminated by the end of June. As I've mentioned on previous calls, our partners, Sinochem, will look more at a $50 oil price to reinitiate any rig activity at that point in time. 
This activity level is expected to deliver production growth at 12%-plus, which we have raised up from 10% plus in 2016. That will allow the company to continue progress its completion optimization program. 
The higher forecasted the growth rate reflects the improving Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity. 
We're keeping our planned capital expenditures the same for both drilling activity and vertical integration spending at $2 billion for '16, $1.85 billion for drilling and $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. 
We do -- we get asked all the time, we put the comment in here, that Pioneer expects to add 5 to 10 horizontal rigs when the price of oil recovers to $50 a barrel, and the outlook for oil supply demand fundamentals is positive. 
So what do we mean by this? I mean what's ideal? The strip in 17 [ph] has moved up to about 47 47 50 for oil. Today's price is close to $44. So if we see the strip in '17, for instance, get up to $50, and we see inventory starting to decrease, which gives us confidence in the supply demand fundamentals, we know the supply-side is dropping. U.S. should see a significant drop in the third quarter on the U.S. shale, probably a good 400,000, 500,000 barrels a day just in that quarter, in the third quarter, especially as reported by the EIA. 
And so what's ideal? We don't want to add them all at the same time. We would like to add a few at a time. So I know we get -- Frank gets asked the question a lot, so that gives you a little bit more flavor and detail. 
I'm going to Slide #5. On our hedge position, obviously we're almost fully hedged for 2016 for oil. We moved our hedges up from 20% to 50% for 2017. The detail hedges are in the back. We would like to also continue to move that number up in '17 over time gas as we see the oil price continue to move up in 2017. 
We did a little bit more gas hedging for '17, it's up to about 25%, still about 70% for 2016. That leads us very strong investment-grade balance sheet. I think we're 1 of only 6 or 7 companies that Moody rates investment grade now. The forecasted cash flow enables the company to grow production and fund its expected capital program through '17 without increasing debt. 
Our cash on hand and liquid investments at $2.5 billion in the first quarter, includes proceeds from the successful equity offering in early January. It also includes $940 million total fund our July 2016 and March '17 senior notes maturities. An additional $500 million will come in July of '16 from our Eagle Ford Shale midstream sales business that we did in 2015. 
Pro forma net debt to '16 operating cash flow of 0.4 at the end of first quarter, we had a debt-to-book of 10%. 
I'm going to Slide #6. No change in our capital program. I think the only change on this slide is the fact that star is moving around on the rainbow chart. It's up to 1.4 billion. If the strip holds the rest of the year, it will be up closer to 1.5 billion. So that gives us an extra $100 million to $200 million of cash that will be added into over [indiscernible] by the end of 2016. 
Slide #7. Obviously, again, reminding people, we did increase our production growth forecast from 10%-plus to 12%-plus. So that takes us up to 229,000 barrels a day equivalent for 2016. Still keeping oil at 56% oil up from 52% due to our well productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Our oil growth has gone up from 20% to 24%-plus. Again, expect continued production growth over the '16, '18 period. Obviously, it will depend on the pace of the commodity price recovery. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim to give more detail on our optimization program."

And I think it's safe to say our completion optimization campaign in the northern part of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp continues to show very impressive results. Toward that end, I'd point you to the graph on the top left. This is a Wolfcamp B graphic which shows all of the wells that have been completed utilizing our optimization campaign since mid part of last year, mid-2015. That's a total of 68 wells. What you see in the blue curve is an average of all those wells in terms of its early production. And you can see it's pretty clear that blue line far exceeds the million barrel BOE type curve shown below that. In fact, we would calculate that the early production rate which shows about 35% improvement compared to that curve. So that's obviously extremely positive from the standpoint of our completion testing. And then if you look at the top right, the Wolfcamp A, we see similar results although realizing it's a substantial smaller sample size, only 13 wells since the mid part of last year. I think it's really too early to call what the ultimate uplift will be for the Wolfcamp A. But for the time being, the chart will easily show the 20% improvement compared to 1 million barrel type curve. 
Lower Spraberry shale, again a relatively smaller sample size, 16 wells in the same time frame. Our early results again, but we are showing improvement. We calculate this more about 10% over the 1 million barrel type curve currently. 
But suffice it to say, on the 97 wells that we have performed completion optimization on through the end of the first quarter, we've seen significant improvement. 42 of those wells of the 97 that is were placed on production in the first quarter, and have seen similar productivity gains as had been the case in the prior couple of quarters. And now it's the case that these 97 wells provide a baseline for further testing that we're doing in 2016.  And I'll talk more about that in a couple of slides. 
On Slide 9, we see similar results in the southern Wolfcamp area from the standpoint of completion optimization, where we've tested about 22 wells through the end of the first quarter. You can see on the graph on the left the effects of the Wolfcamp B again. In this case, about a 25% improvement over that 1 million barrel type curve on 21 wells since the fourth quarter last year. And then similarly on the Wolfcamp A, the improvement of about 25%. In this case, above the 800,000 BOE type curves which we tend to see in the south. [indiscernible] only 1 well in the Wolfcamp A on the bottom right graph, but nonetheless, it's also encouraging. 
Turning now to Slide 10. This is the slide in which we show a little bit more detail on how these completion designs have adjusted through time. If you look at the left-hand part of the slide, you see our basic initial design of the fracs during the period 2013 and '14, which is early days in terms of the play. And it generally had us with probably no more than 1,000 pounds of sand per foot, 30 pounds -- 30 barrels per foot of fluids, 60-foot cluster spacing, 240-foot stage spacing. And the idea there was long half-length fracs was the initial design concept to reach out and test rock far away from the wellbore. 
As we move forward into 2015, in the second half of 2015 to the first quarter, we've now put these 97 wells on production in the north, 22 in the south. It's the subject of really more of the same, which is 1,400 pounds, you can see in this graph, 36 barrels of fluid and so on, tighter cluster spacing. Of course, this does cost money, that's what gets us to about $7.5 million to $8 million well cost base on the 9,000-foot lateral, the additional 500,000 coming from this frac design. 
But in essence, that frac design that we put in place and we now see the results for becomes the new standard design and really the new base case that we're testing the further optimization techniques that we're employing this year. We're going to see more results as we go. There's an 80-well campaign underway to really substantially increase the profit utilization come, in some cases after 2,000 pounds per foot, in some cases over 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and even down to 15,000-foot cluster spacing. And so we really are pushing the design envelope right now to hopefully be able to reach some sort of optimal stage here by the end of this year in terms about how to complete of these wells, at least from the standpoint of utilization of current technology. And that additional amount of fluid and profit and so on does add about 500,000 to 1 million per well, and I think it's -- we believe optimization actually will have a positive payout, but stay tuned on that. We really won't see much data until we get into the second through the fourth quarters. 
As you can see, just depicted from the cartoon standpoint, what we're trying to do is now design completions to allow more rock near the well bore to be contacted. It also will allow us theoretically to more tightly space the wells and optimize recoveries. So I think this is an action that we have and are planning on for some time. We have this well underway as we speak and hope to see some positive results going forward. We'll certainly know much more in the next few quarters. 
This is really one of the critical reasons that we mentioned in regard to maintaining our 12-rig campaign because we really need to continue our further our understanding of this completion optimization business so that we are ready when we accelerate our drilling campaign when things improved in terms of combining these 2 do so in an optimal fashion. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Another area where we've been successful in adding value is extending laterals coming, in this case, beyond 10,000 feet. We placed a couple of our longest laterals on production in the first quarter, 11,000 and 13,000 feet of perforations. Each of which was the subject of completion optimization being longer laterals roughly about $10 million each. Early data looks very encouraging, shown here on the graph on the bottom, you see on the green line the 2 most recent wells to longer lateral wells as compared to wells that were drilled in prior to those, which have a shorter lateral. So in the case of the 23 wells you see on the blue curve, you see -- or below that 13 wells, which on the gray curve, it's pretty clear to see that the longer laterals are in fact contributing really substantial improvements over their earlier predecessors, which are more like 9,500-foot laterals and 7,000-foot laterals. So I think it's pretty clear, we continue to see a very strong correlation between lateral length, perforated lateral lengths and well productivity and we continue to see that as we look forward.  I would say, we do calculations over 60% or so of our acreage is amiable to based on the leasehold configurations, over 10,000-foot lateral drilling. 
Turning now to Slide 12. This is an update essentially from a slide that we shared with you last quarter. It shows now a 32% decrease from the year end '14 to the first quarter in terms of our Drilling and Completion cost per foot. We still are at the point where we can reduce this going forward. The easiest way to explain is we still are under old drilling contracts with a very high day rates in the mid-20s where today's rates are probably more in the mid-teens. So we'll continue as those contracts roll off to see reductions, not considering the fact that we're also going to be continuing to try to optimize regarding completions. And one of the major areas where we see cost reduction opportunities has been in our frac fleet efficiency where we measure that in terms of the number of fleet that are completed per day by each fleet. And in this case, we've seen the average Pioneer pumping services fleet increase substantially from about 800 feet per day of lateral section completed to about 1,200 feet per day during the first quarter. And that translates directly into speed of the job as well as then in addition, the cost reductions that come from time. And really where the is we're getting more wells POP’d faster, and that's simply another component of outperformance when it comes to production. And certainly, of course, further helps to reduce cost and improve our overall drilling economics. 
Turning now to Slide 13. Activity continues to be focused on the north where our plans are essentially unchanged when we were last quarter. And Scott mentioned the fact we'll be drilling with the 12 rigs in the north with about 230 wells to be put on production. Our mix of wells still is predominantly Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A. The mix essentially remains the same. What was now prior course, the standard completion technique is now so that the new optimization campaign I mentioned earlier. And if we look at this from the standpoint of the 2015 optimization campaign, we're still in that $7.5 million to $8 million cost per well, assuming 9,000-foot laterals. In addition to which, to the extent the optimization is completed on those wells in the new style of optimization we added our 500,000 or 1 million per well. 
One advantage we have in this field is a tremendous opportunity presented by low LOE. Because these are very high volume wells, and they typically run $3 to $5 per BOE in terms of their lease operating expense. If we add taxes on, we have a very favorable $5 to $7 total cost to operate these wells. And that's one of the reasons Rich will comment on this, but you'll continued to see our LOE per BOE reduced through time simply because as we add more of these horizontal wells into the mix, it just drives on our averages in terms of LOE. 
The economics still look good. I think they're still conducive to our drilling activity. And certainly with regard to where prices are today, we'll exceeded 30% IRRs, probably in the neighborhood of approaching $40. And it's also, of course, allows us to progress our completion optimization campaign and be ready to optimally move ahead when we get the price message is to accelerate drilling. 
And then on Slide 14. The outstanding well performance I've been talking about in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area is driving strong growth, and actually with production exceeding our forecast once again has led us in this field to increase our guidance for the rest of the year. And actually, the total year now is 167,000 BOE compared to an earlier forecast of 162,000. First quarter production was very strong. Scott has already touched on all these numbers. But this field particular we have 149,000 BOE per day, almost 70% oil, an increase of about 9% [ph] since the fourth quarter last year. We did put the 55 wells on production this quarter, 42 in the north, 13 in the south, and you can see on this slide, the mix of wells. Again, it's very similar to the mix of campaign of '16 in total, which is predominance on A B wells. Once again, production in the quarter benefited from the completion optimization, longer laterals, POP timing due to efficiency gains and everything we've been talking about in the prior slides. 
Looking forward, we're increasing the growth rate of the field to about 33% this year. It had been at 30%. Again, this reflecting on these productivity gains. And we will be POP-ing, estimated about 60 wells in the second quarter, that compares to 55% in the first quarter. We are utilizing choke management in some areas and where that leads to is a situation where 24-hour IP rates and even in some cases, 30-day IP rates can be -- can really have less meaning when we are optimizing the use of the infrastructure in the area without overbuilding water capacity for peak production. What we're doing, of course, is we're POPing with more fluid. We're also, just by choice, completing more wells near existing infrastructure, and what that has the effect of doing is filling up our water handling capacity. And so we do is we chocked the wells back typically for a couple of weeks, it can be 2 to 4 weeks, in order to basically allow them to produce and not overfill those facilities, and at which point in time, we will basically pull produced the wells. But again  as I said, one of the main aspects of this is to consider is I think the right economic decision. But at the same time, it will cost IP rates in some cases appear a bit odd because of the curtailment of the wells in certain areas. I think we'll see a little bit of this going into the next quarter, and simply because where we're choosing to complete the wells in the quarter. 
So overall, I'd say it's a stellar quarter for the company from an operational standpoint. And it sure sets us up well for a strong 2016 from the standpoint of our full year results. 
And with that, I want to pass it to Rich for his review of the financials for the quarter and also his outlook for the second quarter."
295224,328037731,962840,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then",839,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then you can see on the slide here include unusual items aggregating a $52 million loss or $0.32 per diluted share, principally related to impairments, one in the West Panhandle field and one in Alaska where we held a royalty interest into unproved acreage. Those are mainly due to lower commodity prices at the end of March. We also took a charge of $10 million associated with the early termination of 10 drilling rig contracts that we're not going to use part of the exploration. And so that was just a cost-savings decision to do that. So after adjusting for the unusual items Scott mentioned, we had $104 million loss or $0.64, principally attributable to the lower commodity price environment that we're dealing with. 
If you look at the bottom of the Slide 15, where we showed Q1 guidance versus results, Scott talked about the outperformance on production. And then if you look at the rest of the items, they were either on the positive side of guidance or within guidance throughout I won't go to each in details. Just to say it was a really good quarter, the company's cost pressure continues to come down, and so other than the back drop of commodity prices, really excellent results. 
Turning to Slide 16, looking at price realization in more detail. As you guys all know, it was a tough quarter on pricing. Oil prices for the company were down 26% to $28.09. NGLs were down 15% to $10.33 per barrel, and gas prices were down 12% to $1.79. Fortunately for the company, we're well hedged and so we're mitigated by our derivative portfolio. We're running about $217 million of incremental cash flow from our derivatives. Hopefully, the first quarter was the low point as commodity prices have strengthened some in the second quarter. And so hopefully, we've seen the bottom and future quarters will show better realizations. 
The one other item I point out at the bottom on our NYMEX differential for oil for the first quarter. You can again see it was up a little over $1 the differential. That's predominantly due to Eagle Ford condensate sales in the last year. If you recall, we were exporting about 20,000 gross barrels a day of condensate. That contract expired at the end of the year, and so we had a few minor spot sales in the first quarter. But principally, got domestic pricing, and so that caused our differential to go back up. We do have or expect to see improved pricing in the second quarter with our improved domestic pricing at our new contract. 
Turning to Slide 17 on production cost. All of the asset teams, as Tim talked about, have really done a great job on working to lower their cost structure and improve our margins. You can see that production cost were down 17% in total from Q4 to Q1. Base LOE was down 20% quarter-on-quarter, principally related to lower costs on chemicals, electricity, contract services and just efficiency improvements at the operations guys are doing to really help with margins. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. And plus, as Tim mentioned, we are adding more horizontal wells to the mix of wells with an average of $5 to $7 per BOE of production cost, which will help drive to these costs down. 
Turning to Slide 18, the company's balance sheet. We have excellent liquidity with net debt at the end of the quarter of $1.1 billion. That's net of cash on hand and our liquid investments about $2.5 billion. We're still expecting to get the $500 million in July from our Eagle Ford midstream business as sale did last year that will come in July. Undrawn credit facility at $1.5 billion, still completely unused. As you're aware, we have prefunded our 2016 and 2017 bond maturities, and so that's in the $2.5 billion of cash on hand. And so no near-term maturities, we got that all taken care of. And during the last 60 days or so, we have been affirmed by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. So obviously they're recognizing the company's strength of our balance sheet. So overall, it's excellent balance sheet, well positioned to increase activity levels, when oil prices improve, as Scott and Tim both talked about. 
Turning to Slide 19, and switching gears to second quarter guidance. We are forecasting production of 224,000 to 229,000 BOEs per day for the quarter. The rest of the items here are really consistent with first quarter results, so when to each of those details, I'll let you read through those. But consistent with what you would have for our first quarter actual results. So with that, why don't we stop there, and we'll open up the call for questions."

Most of those were near the very end of the quarter, as you might expect, this is how the timing works, and so they don't have much of an effect on the first quarter results as they will have more of an effect in the second quarter. But as to the bigger picture, I think we're going to see continuous optimization gains across the board. It has to do with all the things I mentioned regarding the completion optimization campaign on the one hand, but also mixing in longer laterals. We're going to have 10 to 20 long lateral wells here in the little mix for 2016 as well. So this is going to be more all of the above. I think you're going to see continuous -- you'll see us hopefully continue to outperform."

So I don't think you would necessarily say that, that's going to be the same exact results everywhere we drill. But I think what you'll see is the same sort of upticks on lateral drilling or lateral extensions. The way we look at it is where we are today and I should say out to 13,000 feet is probably the economic limit and realizing if you talking about extended reach drilling, it could be tens of thousands of feet longer than that. The issue is these are wells in which we're pumping very large fracs so you have hydraulic limitations out at the tow where you're not going to be able to necessarily get off as an effective frac. And we think we're still pretty close to linear in terms of the relationship between lateral lengths out to 11,000 to 13,000 feet and productivity of the well one-to-one payout. And we know the economics are strong for that standpoint. But I think we're almost at the limit in terms of the fact that even though we can drill longer wells completing them becomes a hydraulic issue. So I think this probably about where we're going to stop. But the more 13,000-footer you can do, the better is kind of our current view. So that means what we try to do is configure leaseholder we can to get out to 12,000, 13,000 feet by doing acreage swaps and other trades."

But it's such a huge volume order it creates a logistic problem and it's minimum 2 50 per barrel to do so. And to go build bigger facilities, we all know the conundrum presented by that, which is we can we can actually build bigger facilities and they'll only be used for 2 weeks, while we would basically see decline in the initial production of the well both in terms of water and oil. And so this, we think, is optimal is to simply just slightly choke back the wells until the facilities can handle the volumes, considering the volumes are substantially higher. I think we'll see less of an effect on this as we get into the second quarter simply because we're been drilling in different areas that won't have as close to existing infrastructure.

And the other thing that occurs to me and the question is, we're not even talking about spacing. What happened in this field was we begun by looking at 500- to 600-foot spacing, we have situations where we have we thought was too much well interference at the time we're drilling larger back half length wells, I mean, completions. That was really kind of the 1.0 model. And since then, we now find we're completing the wells with more near wellbore rock stimulation. That allows for the potential for tightening spacing. So we're now actually testing down to again, down to 500- to 600-foot spacing where we had blown it up to 900 to 1,000 for that concern regarding interference. So now you're talking about substantial incremental improvement in overall EURs from selected field areas. So the recovery rates go up.

Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,0",1124,"Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 55% oil. So we're well along on our movement from 52% to 56% oil from '15 to '16. Way above Pioneer's guidance range of 211,000 barrels a day equivalent to 216,000, an increase of 7,000 barrels a day equivalent or 3% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Oil production is up 10,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Obviously, driven by the growth of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. 
What's also a milestone for the company, our gross production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp fields exceeded 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for the first time, and total field production has exceeded and surpassed 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and still growing, probably the only field growing in today's environment in North America. 
We placed 55 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field during the first quarter. All wells benefited from completion optimization, which Tim will give you a lot more detail. 
Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the field, both with the optimization program, longer lateral lengths, increasing and enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost-reduction initiatives are still driving down cost per lateral foot. 
What's also more important again, reducing our combined production cost and G&A expense for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 15%. We continue over the next several quarters continue to see continued improvement in regard to those numbers. 
We also added the recently Targa-operated Spraberry/Wolfcamp gas processing plant of 200 million a day. It's online. Essentially is up to about 120 million a day, that came from other plants, which reduced their intake in those other plants, so there's plenty of room for the next 2 or 3 years for additional capacity. 
Pioneer, just to remind people, we do own 27% of this system. 
Increased oil and gas derivative coverage for '17. We've already released these numbers, and we'll talk a little bit more about it moving our hedges up -- all hedges up primarily 50% for 2017. 
Slide #4, on our outlook. We plan to maintain our 12 horizontal rigs in the north Spraberry/Wolfcamp field based on favorable returns in the area. We're currently operating 12 horizontal rigs in the north and 2 in the south. The 2 in the south will be terminated by the end of June. As I've mentioned on previous calls, our partners, Sinochem, will look more at a $50 oil price to reinitiate any rig activity at that point in time. 
This activity level is expected to deliver production growth at 12%-plus, which we have raised up from 10%-plus in 2016. That will allow the company to continue progress its completion optimization program. 
The higher forecasted growth rate reflects the improving Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity. 
We're keeping our planned capital expenditures the same for both drilling activity and vertical integration spending at $2 billion for '16, $1.85 billion for drilling and $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. 
We do -- we get asked all the time, we put the comment in here, but Pioneer expects to add 5 to 10 horizontal rigs when the price of oil recovers to $50 a barrel, and the outlook for oil supply/demand fundamentals is positive. 
So what do we mean by this? I mean, what's ideal? The strip in '17 has moved up to about $47, $47.50 for oil. Today's price is close to $44. So if we see the strip in '17, for instance, get up to $50, and we see inventory starting to decrease, which gives us confidence in the supply/demand fundamentals, we know the supply side is dropping. U.S. should see a significant drop in the third quarter on the U.S. shale, probably a good 400,000, 500,000 barrels a day just in that quarter, in the third quarter, especially as reported by the EIA. 
And so what's ideal? We don't want to add them all at the same time. We would like to add a few at a time. So I know we get -- Frank gets asked the question a lot, so that gives you a little bit more flavor and detail. 
I'm going to Slide #5. On our hedge position, obviously we're almost fully hedged for 2016. For oil, we moved our hedges up from 20% to 50% for 2017. The detail hedges are in the back. We would like to also continue to move that number up in '17 over time as we see the oil price continue to move up in 2017. 
We did a little bit more gas hedging for '17, it's up to about 25%, still about 70% for 2016. That leads us very strong investment-grade balance sheet. I think we're 1 of only 6 or 7 companies that Moody's rates investment grade now. The forecasted cash flow enables the company to grow production and fund its expected capital program through '17 without increasing debt. 
Our cash on hand and liquid investments at $2.5 billion in the first quarter, includes proceeds from the successful equity offering in early January. It also includes $940 million that'll fund our July 2016 and March '17 senior note maturities. An additional $0.5 billion will come in July of '16 from our Eagle Ford Shale midstream sale business that we did in 2015. 
Pro forma net debt to '16 operating cash flow of 0.4x. At the end of first quarter, we had a debt-to-book of 10%. 
I'm going to Slide #6. No change in our capital program. I think the only change on this slide is the fact that star is moving around on the rainbow chart. It's up to $1.4 billion. If the strip holds the rest of the year, it will be up closer to $1.5 billion. So that gives us an extra $100 million to $200 million of cash that will be added into our coffers by the end of 2016. 
Slide #7. Obviously, again, reminding people, we did increase our production growth forecast from 10%-plus to 12%-plus. So that takes us up to 229,000 barrels a day equivalent for 2016. Still keeping oil at 56% oil up from 52% due to our well productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Our oil growth has gone up from 20% to 24%-plus. Again, expect continued production growth over the '16, '18 period. Obviously, it will depend on the pace of the commodity price recovery. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim to give them more detail on our optimization program."

Toward that end, I'd point you to the graph on the top lef",2336,"Thanks, Scott. I'll turn now to Slide 8. And I think it's safe to say our completion optimization campaign in the northern part of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp continues to show very impressive results. Toward that end, I'd point you to the graph on the top left. This is a Wolfcamp B graphic which shows all of the wells that have been completed utilizing our optimization campaign since mid part of last year, mid-2015. That's a total of 68 wells. What you see in the blue curve is an average of all those wells in terms of its -- their early production. And you can see it's pretty clear that blue line far exceeds the million barrel BOE type curve shown below. In fact, we would calculate that the early production rate which show about 35% improvement compared to that curve. So that's, obviously, extremely positive from the standpoint of our completion testing. And then if you look at the top right, the Wolfcamp A, we see similar results although realizing it's a substantial smaller sample size, only 13 wells since the mid part of last year. I think it's really too early to call what the ultimate uplift will be for the Wolfcamp A. But for the time being, the chart would easily show the 20% improvement compared to 1 million barrel type curve. 
Lower Spraberry shale, again a relatively smaller sample size, 16 wells in the same time frame. Our early results again, but we are showing improvement. We calculate this more about 10% over the 1 million barrel type curve currently. 
But suffice it to say, on the 97 wells that we have performed completion optimization on through the end of the first quarter, we've seen significant improvement. 42 of those wells, of the 97 that is, were placed on production in the first quarter, and have seen similar productivity gains as had been in the case in the prior couple of quarters. And now it's the case that these 97 wells provide a baseline for further testing that we're doing in 2016.  And I'll talk more about that in a couple of slides I have. On Slide 9, we see similar results in the southern Wolfcamp area from the standpoint of completion optimization, where we've tested about 22 wells through the end of the first quarter. You can see on the graph on the left the effects of the Wolfcamp B again. In this case, about a 25% improvement over that 1 million barrel type curve on 21 wells since the fourth quarter last year. And then similarly on the Wolfcamp A, an improvement of about 25%. In this case, above the 800,000 BOE type curves which we tend to see in the south. Of course that's only 1 well in the Wolfcamp A on the bottom right graph, but nonetheless, it's also encouraging. 
Turning now to Slide 10. This is the slide in which we show a little bit more detail on how these completion designs have adjusted through time. If you look at the left-hand part of the slide, you see our basic initial design of fracs during the period of 2013 and '14, which is early days in terms of the play. And it generally had us with probably no more than 1,000 pounds of sand per foot, 30 pounds -- sorry, 30 barrels per foot of fluids, 60-foot cluster spacing, 240-foot stage spacing. And the idea there was long half-length fracs was the initial design concept to reach out and test rock far away from the wellbore. 
As we move forward into 2015, in the second half of 2015 to the first quarter, we've now put the 97 wells on production in the north, 22 in the south. It's the subject of really more of the same, which is 1,400 pounds. You can see on this graph, 36 barrels of fluid and so on, tighter cluster spacing. Of course, that does cost money, that's what gets us to about the $7.5 million to $8 million well cost base on the 9,000-foot lateral, the additional $500,000 coming from this frac design. 
But in essence, the frac design that we put in place and we've now see the results for becomes the new standard design and really, the new base case that we're testing the further optimization techniques that we're employing this year. We're going to see more results as we go. There's an 80-well campaign underway to really substantially increase the profit utilization, in some cases after 2,000 pounds per foot, in some cases over 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and even down to 15,000-foot cluster spacing. And so we really are pushing the design envelope right now to hopefully be able to reach some sort of optimal stage here by the end of this year in terms about how to complete of these wells, at least from the standpoint of utilization of current technology. And that additional amount of fluid and profit and so on does add about $0.5 million to $1 million per well, and I think it's -- we believe that the optimization actually -- will actually have a positive payout, but stay tuned on that because we really won't see much data on this till we get into the second through the fourth quarters. 
As you can see, just depicted from the cartoon standpoint, what we're trying to do is now design completions to allow more rock near the well bore to be contacted. It also will allow us theoretically to more tightly space the wells and optimize recoveries. So I think this is an action that we have been planning on for some time. We have this well underway as we speak and hope to see some positive results going forward. We'll certainly know much more in the next few quarters. 
This is really one of the critical reasons that we mentioned in regard to maintaining our 12-rig campaign because we really need to continue our further understanding of this completion optimization business so that we're ready when we accelerate our drilling campaign when things improved in terms of commodities to do so in an optimal fashion. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Another area where we've been successful in adding value is extending laterals, in this case, beyond 10,000 feet. We placed a couple of our longest laterals on production in the first quarter, 11,000 and 13,000 feet of perforations. Each of which was the subject of completion optimization versus wells being longer laterals out and roughly about $10 million each. Early data looks very encouraging, as shown here on the graph on the bottom, you see on the green line the 2 most recent wells the longer lateral wells as compared to wells that were drilled in prior to those, which had a shorter lateral. So in the case of the 23 wells you see on the blue curve, you see -- or below that 13 wells, which are on the gray curve and it's pretty clear to see that the longer laterals are in fact contributing really substantial improvements over their earlier predecessors, which were more like 9,500-foot laterals and 7,000-foot laterals. So I think it's pretty clear, we continue to see a very strong correlation between lateral length, perforated lateral lengths and well productivity and we continue to see that as we look forward. I would say, we do calculations over 60% or so of our acreage is amiable to based on the leasehold configurations, over 10,000-foot lateral drilling. 
Turning now to Slide 12. This is an update essentially from a slide that we shared with you last quarter. It shows now a 32% decrease from the year-end '14 till the first quarter in terms of our Drilling and Completion cost per foot. We still are at a point where, I think, we can reduce this going forward. The easiest way to explain it is we still are under old drilling contracts with a very high day rates in the mid-20s where today's rates are probably more in the mid-teens. So we'll continue as those contracts roll off to see reductions, not considering the fact we're also going to be continuing to try to optimize regarding completions. And one of the major areas where we see cost reduction opportunities has been in our frac fleet efficiency where we really measure that in terms of the number of feet that are completed per day by each fleet. And in this case, we've seen the average Pioneer pumping services fleet increase substantially from about 800 feet per day of lateral section completed to about 1,200 feet per day during the first quarter. And that translates directly into speed of the job as well as then in addition, the cost reductions that come from time. And really what it amounts to is we're getting more wells POP’d faster, and that's simply another component of outperformance when it comes to production. And certainly, of course, further helps to reduce cost and improve our overall drilling economics. 
Turning now to Slide 13. Activity continues to be focused on the north where our plans are essentially unchanged when we were last quarter. And Scott mentioned the fact we'll be drilling with the 12 rigs in the north with about 230 wells to be put on production. Our mix of wells still is predominantly Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A. The mix essentially remains the same. What was now the -- prior, of course, the standard completion technique is down subject to the new optimization campaign I mentioned earlier. And if we look at this from the standpoint of the 2015 optimization campaign, we're still in that $7.5 million to $8 million cost per well, assuming 9,000-foot laterals. In addition to which, to the extent the optimization is completed on those wells in the new style of optimization we added our $0.5 million or $1 million per well. 
One advantage we have in this field is a tremendous opportunity presented by low LOE. This because these are very high volume wells, and they typically run $3 to $5 per BOE in terms of the lease operating expense. We add taxes on, you got a very favorable $5 to $7 total cost to operate these wells. And that's one of the reasons, Rich will comment on this, but you continue to see our LOE per BOE reduced through time it's simply because as we add more of these horizontal wells into the mix, it just drives down our averages in terms of LOE. 
The economics still look good. I think they're still conducive to our drilling activity. And certainly with regard to where the prices are today, we'll exceeded 30% IRRs, probably in the neighborhood of approaching 40%. And it also, of course, allows us to progress our completion optimization campaign and be ready to optimally move ahead when we think -- we get the price messages to accelerate drilling. 
And then on Slide 14. The outstanding well performance I've been talking about in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area is driving strong growth, and actually with the production exceeding our forecast once again it has led us in this field to increase our guidance for the rest of the year. And actually, the total year now is 167,000 BOE compared to an earlier forecast of 162,000. First quarter production was very strong. Scott has already touched on a lot of these numbers. But in this field particularly we had 149,000 BOE per day, almost 70% oil, an increase of about 9% since the fourth quarter last year. We did put the 55 wells on production this quarter, 42 in the north, 13 in the south, and you can see on this slide, the mix of wells. Again, it's very similar to the mix of campaign of '16 in total, which is predominance on A, B wells. Once again, production in the quarter benefited from the completion optimization, longer laterals, POP timing due to efficiency gains and everything we've been talking about in the prior slides. 
Looking forward, we're increasing the growth rate of the field to about 33% this year. It had been at 30%. Again, just reflecting on these productivity gains. And we will be POP-ing, estimated about 60 wells in the second quarter, that compares to 55% in the first quarter. We are utilizing choke management in some areas and what that leads to is a situation where 24-hour IP rates and even in some cases, 30-day IP rates can be -- can really have less meaning when we are optimizing the use of the infrastructure in the area without overbuilding water capacity for peak production. What we're doing, of course, is we're POP-ing with more fluid. We're also, just by choice, completing more wells near the existing infrastructure, and what that has the effect of doing is filling up our water handling capacity. And so we do is we choke the wells back typically for a couple of weeks, it can be 2 to 4 weeks, in order to basically allow them to produce and not overfill those facilities, and at which point in time, we will basically produce the wells. But, again, as I said, one of the main aspects of this to consider is I think is the right economic decision. But at the same time, it will cost IP rates in some cases to appear a bit odd because of the curtailment of the wells in certain areas. I think we'll see a little bit less of this going into the next quarter, and simply because where we're choosing to complete the wells in the quarter. 
So overall, I'd say it's a stellar quarter for the company from an operational standpoint. And it sure sets us up well for a strong 2016 from the standpoint of our full year results. 
And with that, I want to pass it to Rich for his review of the financials for the quarter and also his outlook for the second quarter."

I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then",852,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then you can see on this slide here and included unusual items aggregating a $52 million loss or $0.32 per diluted share, principally related to impairments, one in the West Panhandle field and one in Alaska where we held a royalty interest and some unproved acreage. Those are mainly due to lower commodity prices at the end of March. We also took a charge of $10 million associated with the early termination of 10 drilling rig contracts that we're not going to use prior to their exploration. And so that was just a cost-savings decision to do that. So after adjusting for the unusual items that Scott mentioned, we were at $104 million loss or $0.64, principally attributable to the lower commodity price environment that we're dealing with. 
If you look at the bottom of the Slide 15, where we show Q1 guidance versus results, Scott talked about the outperformance on production and then if you look at, really, the rest of the items, they were either on the positive side of guidance or within guidance throughout this. I won't go through each in details, just to say that it was a really good quarter, the company's cost pressure continues to come down, and so other than the back drop of commodity prices, really excellent results. 
Turning to Slide 16, looking at price realizations in more detail. As you guys all know, it was a tough quarter on pricing. Oil prices for the company were down 26% to $28.09. NGLs were down 15% to $10.33 per barrel, and gas prices were down 12% to $1.79. Fortunately for the company, we're well hedged and so we're mitigated by our derivative portfolio. We're running about $217 million of incremental cash flow from our derivatives. Hopefully, the first quarter was the low point as commodity prices have strengthened some in the second quarter. And so hopefully, we've seen the bottom and future quarters will show better realizations. 
The one other item I'd point out at the bottom on our NYMEX differential for oil for the first quarter. You can, again, see it was up a little over $1 the differential. That's predominantly due to Eagle Ford condensate sales in the last year. If you recall, we were exporting about 20,000 gross barrels a day of condensate. That contract expired at the end of the year, and so we had a few minor spot sales in the first quarter. But principally, got domestic pricing, and so that caused our differential to go back up. We do have or expect to see improved pricing in the second quarter with a improved domestic pricing at our new contract. 
Turning to Slide 17 on production cost. All of the asset teams, as Tim talked about, have really done a great job on working to lower their cost structure and improve our margins. You can see that production cost were down 17% in total from Q4 to Q1. Base LOE was down 20% quarter-on-quarter, principally related to lower costs on chemicals, electricity, contract services and just efficiency improvements that the operations guys are doing to really help with margins. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. And plus, as Tim mentioned, we are adding more horizontal wells to the mix of wells with an average of $5 to $7 per BOE of production cost, which will help continue to drive these costs down. 
Turning to Slide 18, the company's balance sheet. We have excellent liquidity with net debt at the end of the quarter of $1.1 billion. That's net of cash on hand and our liquid investments about $2.5 billion. We're still expect to get that $500 million in July from our Eagle Ford midstream business as sale that did last year that will come in July. Undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, still completely unused. As you're aware, we have prefunded our 2016 and 2017 bond maturities, and so that's in the $2.5 billion of cash on hand. And so no near-term maturities, we've got that all taken care of. And during the last 60 days or so, we have been affirmed by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. So obviously they're recognizing the company's strength of our balance sheet. So overall, it's a excellent balance sheet, well positioned to increase activity levels, when oil prices improve, as Scott and Tim both talked about. 
Turning to Slide 19, and switching gears to second quarter guidance. We are forecasting production of 224,000 to 229,000 BOEs per day for the quarter. The rest of the items here are really consistent with first quarter results, so rather than going through to each of those details, I'll let you read through those, but consistent with what you would have saw for first quarter actual results. So with that, why don't we stop there, and we'll open up the call for questions."

And so they don't have much of an effect on the first quarter results as they will have more of an effect in the second quarter. But as to the bigger picture, I think we're going to see continuous optimization gains across the board. It has to do with all the things I mentioned regarding the completion optimization campaign on the one hand, but also mixing in longer laterals. We're going to have 10 to 20 long lateral wells here in the mix for 2016 as well. So these are going to be more of an all of the above. I think you'll see continuous -- I think you'll see us hopefully continue to outperform."

And they are ready to add rigs. And they're getting pinged upon right now by industries you might expect to start potentially adding rigs. And they would make the case that if we're talking about a handful of rigs, like we are, unless you say 5 to 10 rigs, that's no problem at all. It's when we start to have a major acceleration where they would have issues because what they've done, of course, is to keep most of their management and supervisory personnel, they're going to have to really rebuild staff. There's quite a few people who are available to come back to work. It's just a matter of making that happen. So I don't think a small number of rigs that we're really talking about today is that material of an issue. As for us, of course, we have this advantage that's associated with having Pioneer Pumping Services, Pioneer Well Services, we have our own people ready to go and complete our own wells and work on our own wells. And so we won't miss a beat. And I think our drilling contractors will be with us in good shape, at least for the first tranche."

So I don't think you would necessarily say that, that's going to be the same exact result everywhere we drill. But I think what you'll see is the same sort of upticks on lateral drilling or lateral extensions. The way we look at it is where we are today and I should say out to 13,000 feet is probably the economic limit and realizing if you're talking about extended reach drilling, it can be tens of thousands of feet longer than that. The issue is these are wells in which we're pumping very large fracs, so you have hydraulic limitations out at the tow where you're not going to be able to necessarily get off as an effective frac. We think we're still pretty close to linear in terms of the relationship between lateral lengths out to 11,000 to 13,000 feet and productivity of the well, in other words one-to-one payout. And we know the economics are strong from that standpoint. But I think we're almost at the limit in terms of the fact that even though we could drill longer wells completing them becomes a hydraulic issue. So I think that's probably about where we're going to stop. But the more 13,000 footers you can do, the better is kind of our current view. So that means what we'll be trying to do is configure at least all what we can to get out to 12,000, 13,000 feet by doing acreage swaps and other trades."

But we still have other areas where, I think, we can reduce our cost. We have, as I already mentioned, contracts that are peeling off from the standpoint of drilling contractors over this year into next year. And so coming off of what would have been mid-20s day rates into mid-teens is going to be a substantial effect for us. And there's other ancillary things we're doing as well. At the margin, I think, we can reduce our tubular somewhat from this point on as well, at least marginally maybe 5%. But I think a lot of it will be not just the cost per se from existing contracts and existing supplies, but rather continuing just to improve. And this has to do, in our case, with reducing nonproductive time as an example. And we're splitting up both drilling and completions into small pieces to make sure we can optimize. And so I think you'll start -- you'll see us continually improve, but I think we are reaching more of a flat spot in the curve relative to where we were. You can see a dramatic increases -- or decreases in the early stages of what you should expect. And now we're sort of reaching more of an asymptote but with a small decline going forward."

So we're not trying to affect EURs or wells by choking them back. We don't think there's actually any effect from choking the wells back would amount to typically 2 to 4 weeks, while this substantial water flow back period occurs. And so I think essentially what we're trying to do is optimize infrastructure and then we could haul off this water. But it's such a huge volume of water, it creates a logistic problem and it's minimum at 250 per barrel to do so. And to go build bigger facilities, we all know the conundrum presented by that, which is we could actually build bigger facilities and they'll only be used for 2 weeks, while we would basically see a decline in the initial production of the well both in terms of water and oil. And so this, we think, is optimal is to simply just slightly choke back the wells until the facilities can handle the volumes, considering the volumes are substantially higher. I think we'll see less of an effect on this as we get into the second quarter, as I mentioned, simply because we'll drilling in different areas that won't have as close to existing infrastructure. Of course, that will require infrastructure buildouts. So there's no free lunches in this infrastructure business."

You use a $10 F&D cost, you better feel pretty good that you're getting that kind of percentage increment as well, which is on the well cost base is probably you'll never get a 10%. So you better feel like you're getting at least a 10% bump where you probably wouldn't proceed. But so far our bumps have been substantially higher than that. Remember back to Eagle Ford Shale, we stopped when we were at a point where we were generating 15% to 30% increments. But we're not stopping here. And the other thing that occurs to me in the question is, we're not even talking about spacing. What happened in this field was we've began by looking at 500- to 600-foot spacing, we have situations where we had what we thought was too much well interference at the time we were drilling larger frac -- half-length wells, I mean, completions. That was really kind of the 1.0 model. And since then, we now find where we're completing the wells with more near wellbore rock stimulation. That allows for the potential for tightening spacing. So we're now actually testing down to again, down to 500- or to 600-foot spacing where we had blown this out to 900 to 1,000 for that concern regarding interference. So now you're talking about substantial incremental improvements in overall EURs from selected field areas. So in other words your recovery rates go up. So we're not even referring to that, but behind the scenes, that's also going on. We just don't have any data yet to show you, but it's just another thing on the list to hopefully essentially increase EURs."

Realize you get far out in the wellbore, you have hydraulic issues that may be a limiting factor in terms of how well the completions are pumped at the toe. Also remember we're using still a plug and perf model here for how these wells are completed, and so your drill out campaign becomes much more difficult, especially if we're using coil or what-have-you at that length. So it really becomes more mechanical on the completion, does the drilling. I don't really see us out testing much more in terms of lateral length that out there to the 12,000 to 13,000. But as I mentioned, we have probably over 60% of our acreage today is amenable to plus-10,000-foot drilling. We're going to have 15 -- probably 10, 15, 20 wells that are out past 10,000.

But in the case of the Wolfcamp A and then further to the Lower Spraberry Shale, we just don't have as much data. So it might be into 2018 before you can really say we're in development mode at the optimal way these wells are to be completed. So I think it's going to be a staggered approach.

Scott will be the first speaker, he'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2016, another quarter which saw the company deliver solid execution and outstanding performance. Scott will then review our latest plans for 2016 in the face of continuing commodity price uncertainty. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our continuing strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency improvements in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Rich will then cover the first quarter financials and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. And after that, we'll open up the call, as always, for your questions. 
So Scott, I'll turn the call over to you."
295224,328037731,963597,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,0",1130,"Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide #3, financial and operating highlights. We had a first quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again. First quarter 2016, 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 55% oil. So we're well along on our movement from 52% to 56% oil from '15 to '16. Way above Pioneer's guidance range of 211,000 barrels a day equivalent to 216,000, an increase of 7,000 barrels a day equivalent or 3% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Oil production is up 10,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% versus the fourth quarter of '15. Obviously, driven by the growth of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. 
What's also a milestone for the company, our gross production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp fields exceeded 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for the first time, and total field production has exceeded and surpassed 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and still growing, probably the only field growing in today's environment in North America. 
We placed 55 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field during the first quarter. All wells benefited from completion optimization, which Tim will give you a lot more detail. 
Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the field, both with the optimization program, longer lateral lengths increasing and enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost-reduction initiatives are still driving down cost per lateral foot. 
What's also more important, again, reducing our combined production cost and G&A expense for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 15%. We continue -- over the next several quarters continue to see continued improvement in regard to those numbers. 
We also added the recently Targa-operated Spraberry/Wolfcamp gas processing plant of 200 million MMCFPD a day. It's online. Essentially it's up to about 120 million MMCFPD a day, but that came from other plants, which reduced their intake in those other plants, so there's plenty of room for the next 2 or 3 years for additional capacity. 
Pioneer, just to remind people, we do own 27% of this system. 
Increased oil and gas derivative coverage for '17. We've already released these numbers, and we'll talk a little bit more about it: moving our hedges up -- oil hedges up primarily 50% for 2017. 
Slide #4, on our outlook. We plan to maintain our 12 horizontal rigs in the north Spraberry/Wolfcamp field based on favorable returns in the area. We're currently operating 12 horizontal rigs in the north and 2 in the south. The 2 in the south will be terminated by the end of June. As I have mentioned on previous calls, our partner, Sinochem, will look more at a $50 oil price to reinitiate any rig activity at that point in time. 
This activity level is expected to deliver production growth at 12%-plus, which we have raised up from 10%-plus in 2016. That will allow the company to continue progress its completion optimization program. 
The higher forecasted growth rate reflects the improving Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity. 
We're keeping our planned capital expenditures the same for both drilling activity and vertical integration spending at $2 billion for '16, $1.85 billion for drilling and $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. 
We do -- we get asked all the time, we put the comment in here, but Pioneer expects to add 5 to 10 horizontal rigs when the price of oil recovers to $50 a barrel, and the outlook for oil supply/demand fundamentals is positive. 
So what do we mean by this? I mean, what's ideal? The strip in '17 has moved up to about $47, $47.50 for oil. Today's price is close to $44. So if we see the strip in '17, for instance, get up to $50, and we see inventory starting to decrease, which gives us confidence in the supply/demand fundamentals. We know the supply side is dropping. U.S. should see a significant drop in the third quarter on the U.S. shale, probably a good 400,000, 500,000 barrels a day just in that quarter, in the third quarter, especially as reported by the EIA. 
And so what's ideal? We don't want to add them all at the same time. We would like to add a few at a time. So I know we get -- Frank gets asked the question a lot, so that gives you a little bit more flavor and detail. 
I'm going to Slide #5. On our hedge position, obviously we're almost fully hedged for 2016. For oil, we moved our hedges up from 20% to 50% for 2017. The detailed hedges are in the back. We would like, also, to continue to move that number up in '17 over time as we see the oil price continue to move up in 2017. 
We did a little bit more gas hedging for '17. It's up to about 25%, still about 70% for 2016. That leaves us very strong investment-grade balance sheet. I think we're 1 of only 6 or 7 companies that Moody's rates investment grade now. The forecasted cash flow enables the company to grow production and fund its expected capital program through '17 without increasing debt. 
Our cash on hand and liquid investments at $2.5 billion in the first quarter includes proceeds from the successful equity offering in early January. It also includes $940 million that'll fund our July '16 and March '17 senior note maturities. An additional $0.5 billion will come in July of '16 from our Eagle Ford Shale midstream sale business that we did in 2015. 
Pro forma net debt to '16 operating cash flow of 0.4x. At the end of first quarter, we had a debt-to-book of 10%. 
I'm going to Slide #6. No change in our capital program. I think the only change on this slide is the fact that the star is moving around on the rainbow chart. It's up to $1.4 billion. If the strip holds the rest of the year, it will be up closer to $1.5 billion. So that gives us an extra $100 million to $200 million of cash that will be added into our coffers by the end of 2016. 
Slide #7. Obviously, again, reminding people, we did increase our production growth forecast from 10%-plus to 12%-plus. So that takes us up to 229,000 barrels a day equivalent for 2016. Still keeping oil at 56% oil up from 52% due to our well productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp. Our oil growth has gone up from 20% to 24%-plus. Again, expect continued production growth over the '16, '18 period. Obviously, it will depend on the pace of the commodity price recovery. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on our optimization program."

And I think it's safe to say our completion optimization campaign in the northern part of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp continues to show very impressive results. Toward that end, I'd point you to the graph on the top left. This is a Wolfcamp B graph, which shows all of the wells that have been completed utilizing our optimization campaign since mid-part of last year, mid-2015. That's a total of 68 wells. What you see in the blue curve is an average of all those wells in terms of its -- their early production. And you can see it's pretty clear that blue line far exceeds the million barrel BOE type curve shown below. In fact, we would calculate that the early production rates would show about 35% improvement compared to that curve. So that's, obviously, extremely positive from the standpoint of our completion testing. And then if you look at the top right, the Wolfcamp A, we see similar results although realizing it's a substantial smaller sample size, only 13 wells since the mid part of last year. I think it's really too early to call what the ultimate uplift will be for the Wolfcamp A. But for the time being, the chart would easily show a 20% improvement compared to 1 million barrel type curve. 
Lower Spraberry shale, again a relatively smaller sample size, 16 wells in the same time frame. Our early results again, but we are showing improvement. We calculate this more about 10% over the 1 million barrel type curve, currently. 
But suffice it to say, on the 97 wells that we have performed completion optimization on through the end of the first quarter, we've seen significant improvement. 42 of those wells, of the 97 that is, were placed on production in the first quarter, and have seen similar productivity gains as had been the case in the prior couple of quarters. And now it's the case that these 97 wells provide a baseline for further testing that we're doing in 2016.  And I'll talk more about that in a couple of slides I have. On Slide 9, we see similar results in the southern Wolfcamp area from the standpoint of completion optimization, where we've tested about 22 wells through the end of the first quarter. You can see on the graph on the left the effects of the Wolfcamp B again. In this case, about a 25% improvement over that 1 million barrel type curve on 21 wells since the fourth quarter last year. And then similarly on the Wolfcamp A, an improvement of about 25%. In this case, above the 800,000 BOE type curves which we tend to see in the south. Of course that's only 1 well in the Wolfcamp A on the bottom right graph, but nonetheless, it's also encouraging. 
Turning now to Slide 10. This is the slide in which we show a little bit more detail on how these completion designs have adjusted through time. If you look at the left-hand part of the slide, you see our basic initial design of fracs during the period of 2013 and '14, which is early days in terms of the play. And it generally had us with probably no more than 1,000 pounds of sand per foot, 30 pounds -- sorry, 30 barrels per foot of fluids, 60-foot cluster spacing, 240-foot stage spacing. And the idea there was long half-length fracs was the initial design concept to reach out and touch rock far away from the wellbore. 
As we move forward into 2015, in the second half of 2015 to the first quarter, we've now put the 97 wells on production in the north, 22 in the south. It's the subject of, really, more of the same, which is 1,400 pounds. You can see on this graph, 36 barrels of fluid and so on, tighter cluster spacing. Of course, that does cost money. That's what gets us to about the $7.5 million to $8 million well cost based on the 9,000-foot lateral, the additional $500,000 coming from this frac design. 
But in essence, the frac design that we put in place and we now see the results for becomes the new standard design and really, the new base case that we're testing the further optimization techniques that we're employing this year. We're going to see more results as we go. There's an 80-well campaign underway to really substantially increase the profit utilization, in some cases after 2,000 pounds per foot, in some cases over 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and even down to 15,000-foot cluster spacing. And so we really are pushing the design envelope right now to, hopefully, be able to reach some sort of optimal stage here by the end of this year in terms about how to complete of these wells, at least from the standpoint of utilization of current technology. And that additional amount of fluid and profit and so on does add about $0.5 million to $1 million per well, and I think it's -- we believe that the optimization actually -- will actually have a positive payout. But stay tuned on that because we really won't see much data on this till we get into the second through the fourth quarters. 
As you can see, just depicted from the cartoon standpoint, what we're trying to do is now design completions to allow more rock near the well bore to be contacted. It also will allow us, theoretically, to more tightly space the wells and optimize recoveries. So I think this is an action that we have been planning on for some time. We have this well underway as we speak and hope to see some positive results going forward. We'll certainly know much more in the next few quarters. 
This is really one of the critical reasons that we mentioned in regard to maintaining our 12-rig campaign, because we really need to continue our further understanding of this completion optimization business so that we're ready when we accelerate our drilling campaign when things improve in terms of commodities to do so in an optimal fashion. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Another area where we've been successful in adding value is extending laterals, in this case, beyond 10,000 feet. We placed a couple of our longest laterals on production in the first quarter, 11,000 and 13,000 feet of perforations. Each of which was the subject of completion optimization. Of course those wells being longer laterals out and roughly about $10 million each. Early data looks very encouraging, as shown here on the graph on the bottom. You see on the green line the 2 most recent wells, the longer lateral wells, as compared to wells that were drilled prior to those, which had a shorter lateral. So in the case of the 23 wells you see on the blue curve, you see below that 13 wells, which are on the gray curve, and it's pretty clear to see that the longer laterals are in fact contributing really substantial improvements over their earlier predecessors, which were more like 9,500-foot laterals and 7,000-foot laterals. So I think it's pretty clear we continue to see a very strong correlation between lateral length, perforated lateral length and well productivity, and we continue to see that as we look forward. I would say, we do calculations over 60% or so of our acreage is amenable to, based on the leasehold configurations, over 10,000-foot lateral drilling. 
Turning now to Slide 12. This is an update, essentially, from a slide that we shared with you last quarter. It shows now a 32% decrease from the year-end '14 till the first quarter in terms of our Drilling and Completion cost per foot. We still are at a point where we think we can reduce this going forward. The easiest way to explain it is we still are under old drilling contracts with very high day rates in the mid-20s where today's rates are probably more in the mid-teens. So we'll continue as those contracts roll off to see reductions, not considering the fact we're also going to be continuing to try to optimize regarding completions. And one of the major areas where we see cost reduction opportunities has been in our frac fleet efficiency where we really measure that in terms of the number of feet that are completed per day by each fleet. And in this case, we've seen the average Pioneer pumping services fleet increase substantially from about 800 feet per day of lateral section completed to about 1,200 feet per day during the first quarter. And that translates directly into speed of the job as well as then in addition, the cost reductions that come from time. And really what it amounts to is we're getting more wells POP-ed faster, and that's simply another component of outperformance when it comes to production. And certainly, of course, further helps to reduce costs and improve our overall drilling economics. 
Turning now to Slide 13. Activity continues to be focused on the north where our plans are, essentially, unchanged when we were last quarter. And Scott mentioned the fact we'll be drilling with the 12 rigs in the north with about 230 wells to be put on production. Our mix of wells still is predominantly Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A. The mix, essentially, remains the same. What was now the -- or was prior, of course, the standard completion technique is now subject to the new optimization campaign I mentioned earlier. And if we look at this from the standpoint of the 2015 optimization campaign, we're still in that $7.5 million to $8 million cost per well, assuming 9,000-foot laterals. In addition to which, to the extent the optimization is completed on those wells in the new style of optimization we added our $0.5 million or $1 million per well. 
One advantage we have in this field is a tremendous opportunity presented by low LOE. This is because these are very high volume wells, and they typically run $3 to $5 per BOE in terms of the lease operating expense. When you add taxes on, you have a very favorable $5 to $7 total cost to operate these wells. And that's one of the reasons, Rich will comment on this, but you continue to see our LOE per BOE reduce through time is simply because as we add more of these horizontal wells into the mix, it just drives down our averages in terms of LOE. 
The economics still look good. I think they're still conducive to our drilling activity. And certainly with regard to where the prices are today, we'll exceeded 30% IRRs, probably in the neighborhood of approaching 40%. And it also, of course, allows us to progress our completion optimization campaign and be ready to optimally move ahead when we think we get the price messages to accelerate drilling. 
And then on Slide 14. The outstanding well performance I've been talking about in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area is driving strong growth, and actually with the production exceeding our forecast once again it has led us in this field to increase our guidance for the rest of the year. And actually, the total year now is 167,000 BOE compared to an earlier forecast of 162,000. First quarter production was very strong. Scott has already touched on a lot of these numbers. But in this field, particularly, we had 149,000 BOE per day, almost 70% oil, and it increased about 9% since the fourth quarter last year. We did put the 55 wells on production this quarter, 42 in the north, 13 in the south, and you can see on this slide, the mix of wells. Again, it's very similar to the mix of campaign of '16 in total, which is predominance on A and B wells. Once again, production in the quarter benefited from the completion optimization, longer laterals, POP timing due to efficiency gains and everything we've been talking about in the prior slides. 
Looking forward, we're increasing the growth rate of the field to about 33% this year. It had been at 30%. Again, just reflecting on these productivity gains. And we will be POP-ing, it's estimated, about 60 wells in the second quarter. That compares to 55% in the first quarter. We are utilizing choke management in some areas, and what that leads to is a situation where 24-hour IP rates and even in some cases, 30-day IP rates can be -- can really have less meaning when we are optimizing the use of the infrastructure in the area without overbuilding water capacity for peak production. What we're doing, of course, is we're pumping with more fluid. We're also, just by choice, completing more wells near existing infrastructure, and what that has the effect of doing is filling up our water handling capacity. And so we do is we choke the wells back, typically, for a couple of weeks, it can be 2 to 4 weeks, in order to basically allow them to produce and not overfill those facilities, and at which point in time, we will basically full-produce the wells. But, again, as I said, one of the main aspects of this to consider is I think is the right economic decision. But at the same time, it will cause IP rates in some cases to appear a bit odd because of the curtailment of the wells in certain areas. I think we'll see a little bit less of this going into the next quarter, and simply because of where we're choosing to complete the wells in the quarter. 
So overall, I'd say it's a stellar quarter for the company from an operational standpoint. And it sure sets us up well for a strong 2016 from the standpoint of our full year results. 
And with that, I'm going to pass it to Rich for his review of the financials for the quarter and also his outlook for the second quarter."

I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then",854,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after tax or $0.69. And then you can see on this slide here it included unusual items, aggregating a $52 million loss or $0.32 per diluted share, principally related to impairments: one in the West Panhandle field and one in Alaska where we held a royalty interest in some unproved acreage. Those were mainly due to lower commodity prices at the end of March. We also took a charge of $10 million associated with the early termination of 10 drilling rig contracts that we're not going to use prior to their expiration. And so that was just a cost-savings decision to do that. So after adjusting for the unusual items that Scott mentioned, we're at $104 million loss or $0.64, principally attributable to the lower commodity price environment that we're dealing with. 
If you look at the bottom of Slide 15, where we show Q1 guidance versus results, Scott talked about the outperformance on production. And then if you look at, really, the rest of the items, they were either on the positive side of guidance or within guidance throughout there. So I won't go through each in detail, just to say that it was a really good quarter. The company's cost structure continues to come down, and so other than the back drop of commodity prices, really excellent results. 
Turning to Slide 16, looking at price realizations in more detail. As you guys all know, it was a tough quarter on pricing. Oil prices for the company were down 26% to $28.09. NGLs were down 15% to $10.33 per barrel, and gas prices were down 12% to $1.79. Fortunately for the company, we're well hedged and so we're mitigated by our derivative portfolio. We're running about $217 million of incremental cash flow from our derivatives. Hopefully, the first quarter was the low point as commodity prices have strengthened some in the second quarter. And so hopefully, we've seen the bottom, and future quarters will show better realizations. 
The one other item I'd point out at the bottom on our NYMEX differential for oil for the first quarter. You can, again, see it was up a little over $1, the differential. That's predominantly due to Eagle Ford condensate sales in the -- last year, if you recall, we were exporting about 20,000 gross barrels a day of condensate. That contract expired at the end of the year, and so we had a few minor spot sales in the first quarter. But principally, got domestic pricing, and so that caused our differential to go back up. We do have -- or expect to see improved pricing in the second quarter with a improved domestic pricing at our new contract. 
Turning to Slide 17 on production costs. All of the asset teams, as Tim talked about, have really done a great job on working to lower their cost structure and improve our margins. You can see that production costs were down 17% in total from Q4 to Q1. Base LOE was down 20% quarter-on-quarter, principally related to lower costs on chemicals, electricity, contract services and just efficiency improvements that the operations guys are doing to really help with margins. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. And plus, as Tim mentioned, we are adding more horizontal wells to the mix of wells with an average of $5 to $7 per BOE of production cost, which will help continue to drive these costs down. 
Turning to Slide 18, the company's balance sheet. We have excellent liquidity with net debt at the end of the quarter of $1.1 billion. That's net of cash on hand and our liquid investments about $2.5 billion. We're still expect to get the $500 million in July from our Eagle Ford midstream business sale that we did last year that will come in, in July. Undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, still completely unused. As you're aware, we have prefunded our 2016 and 2017 bond maturities, and so that's in the $2.5 billion of cash on hand. And so no near-term maturities. We've got that all taken care of. And during the last 60 days or so, we have been affirmed by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. So obviously, they're recognizing the company's strength of our balance sheet. So overall I'd say, excellent balance sheet, well positioned to increase activity levels when oil prices improve as Scott and Tim both talked about. 
Turning to Slide 19, and switching gears to second quarter guidance. We are forecasting production of 224,000 to 229,000 BOEs per day for the quarter. The rest of the items here are really consistent with first quarter results. So rather than going through each of those in detail I'll let you read through those, but consistent with what you would have saw for first quarter actual results. So with that, why don't we stop there, and we'll open up the call for questions."

And so they don't have much of an effect on the first quarter results as they will have more of an effect in the second quarter. But as to the bigger picture, I think we're going to see continuous optimization gains across the board. It has to do with all the things I mentioned regarding the completion optimization campaign on the one hand, but also mixing in longer laterals. We're going to have 10 to 20 long lateral wells here in the mix for 2016 as well. So I think it's going to be more of an all of the above. I think you're going to see continuous gains, and I think you'll see us, hopefully, continue to outperform."

So I don't think you would necessarily say that that's going to be the same exact result everywhere we drill. But I think what you'll see is the same sort of upticks on lateral drilling or lateral extensions. The way we look at it is where we are today, unless you say out to 13,000 feet, is probably the economic limit. And realizing if you're talking about extended reach drilling, it can be tens of thousands of feet longer than that. The issue is, these are wells in which we're pumping very large fracs, so you have hydraulic limitations out at the toe where you're not going to be able to necessarily get off as an effective frac. We think we're still pretty close to linear in terms of the relationship between lateral lengths out to 11,000 to 13,000 feet and productivity of the well, in other words one-to-one payout. And we know the economics are strong from that standpoint. But I think we're almost at the limit in terms of the fact that even though we could drill longer wells, completing them becomes a hydraulic issue. So I think that's probably about where we're going to stop. But the more 13,000 footers you can do, the better is kind of our current view. So that means what we'll be trying to do is configure a lease hold where we can to get out to 12,000, 13,000 feet by doing acreage swaps and other trades."

But we still have other areas where, I think, we can reduce our cost. We have, as I already mentioned, contracts that are peeling off from the standpoint of drilling contractors over this year into next year. And so coming off of what would have been mid-20s day rates into mid-teens is going to be a substantial effect for us. And there's other ancillary things that we're doing as well at the margin. I think, we can reduce our tubular somewhat from this point on as well, at least marginally maybe 5%. But I think a lot of it will be not just the cost per se from existing contracts and existing supplies, but rather continuing just to improve. And this has to do, in our case, with reducing nonproductive time as an example. And we're splitting up both drilling and completions into small pieces to make sure we can optimize. And so I think you'll start -- you'll see us continually improve, but I think we are reaching more of a flat spot in the curve relative to where we were.

We don't think there's actually any effect from choking the wells back what would amount to, typically, 2 to 4 weeks, while the substantial water flow back period occurs. And so I think, essentially, what we're trying to do is optimize infrastructure. Now we could haul off this water. But there's such a huge volume of water it creates a logistics problem, and it's minimum of $2.50 per barrel to do so. And to go build bigger facilities, we all know the conundrum presented by that, which is we could actually build bigger facilities and they'll only be used for 2 weeks, while we would basically see a decline in the initial production of the well both in terms of water and oil. And so this, we think, is optimal is to simply just slightly choke back the wells until the facilities can handle the volumes, considering the volumes are substantially higher. I think we'll see less of an effect on this as we get into the second quarter, as I mentioned, simply because we'll drilling in different areas that won't have us as close to existing infrastructure.

The real question is as we get to a point here in the 3.0 model that I was referring to, we're already down to 15-foot cluster spacing. I don't really know how much closer you can get clusters, but it's not much closer than that. And so and I think you're at a point where even in pumping proppant even though we're 1,700 to 2,000 pounds of proppant, you see some plays where they got the 2,500, 3,000. So we maybe have a little marginal ability to move more in that direction. But I think it's -- the more of the same model is something we're really testing in 2016. You're going to see improvement, I think, out of a lot of those techniques. The issue is gone be once you get past there, and you can't really do more of the same because you're limited by space or volume or physics, what you do there. Then you'll probably more into new technology applications, which are a little bit unclear today."

You use a $10 F&D cost, you better feel pretty good that you're getting that kind of percentage increment as well, which is on the well cost basis, probably you've got about 10%. So you better feel like you're getting at least a 10% bump or you probably wouldn't proceed. But so far our bumps have been substantially higher than that. Remember back to Eagle Ford Shale, we stopped when we were at a point where we were generating 15% to 30% increments. But we're not stopping here. And the other thing that occurs to me in the question is, we're not even talking about spacing. What happened in this field was we began by looking at 500- to 600-foot spacing, and we had situations where we had what we thought was too much well interference at a time when we were drilling larger frac -- half-length wells -- I mean, completions. That was really kind of the 1.0 model. And since then, we now find we're completing the wells with more near wellbore rock stimulation. That allows for the potential for tightening spacing. So we're now actually testing down to again, down to 500- or to 600-foot spacing where we had blown it out to 900 to 1,000 for that concern regarding interference. So now you're talking about substantial incremental improvements in overall EURs from selected field areas. So in other words your recovery rates go up. So we're not even referring to that, but behind the scenes, that's also going on. We just don't have any data yet to show you, but it's just another thing on the list to, hopefully essentially, increase EURs."

Realize you get far out in the wellbore, you have hydraulic issues that may be a limiting factor in terms of how well the completions are pumped at the toe. Also remember we're using still a plug and perf model here for how these wells are completed, and so your drill out campaign becomes much more difficult, especially if you're using coil or what-have-you at that length. So it really becomes more mechanical on the completions that it does the drilling. I don't really see us out testing much more in terms of lateral length that out there to the 12,000 to 13,000.

So we're not going to make further decisions on the expansion of the use of 3.0 until we understand whether it's working. And if so, at what sort economic basis that it's working. So to the extent we were to add new rigs, I'd have to kind of hold off and see how 3.0 works. If we think 3.0 works well then we would absolutely add it to every single well that would be a part of the 5 to 10 rig adds. In terms of the zones, the way I think about this when I consult with our geo team, we should know with the plethora of data we have, vis-a-vis the Wolfcamp B and the 3.0 campaign going on in the B this year, we should pretty much be at a point where we will be in full development mode on B at an optimal completion by the end of this year. But in the case of the Wolfcamp A and then further to the Lower Spraberry Shale, we just don't have as much data. So it might be into 2018 before you can really say we're in development mode at the optimal way these wells are to be completed. So I think it's going to be a staggered approach. You can't get all the data every -- I mean today on every single zone at the speed at which we're drilling, but we're trying to accumulate it as fast as we can. But I would think it's Wolfcamp B, ready by the end of the year to be on full development mode, A and Lower Spraberry Shale into '18 and '19."

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, there's one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done since downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years. We got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we're going to start off with Slide #3. In the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter, again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field in the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continued to enhance well productivity. Continued to see cost coming down in a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, great achievement, we're continuing to see [ph] (cut) production cost per BOE by 26% from first half 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? Simply because it's totally integrated our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We had it totally surrounded, allocated 14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying 58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal Wolfcamp B Wolfcamp area, well's between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. 3 of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1x through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from 17 to 20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. what's happened obviously, the [indiscernible] has dropped about $10 from $51, $52 down to $42. obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0. So does it have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't [ph] have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17. It could be in '18. It could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strips stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55 because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."
295224,342899174,1015304,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","thanks, Scott.

As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are",2830,"thanks, Scott. I'm turning to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having this -- not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going to the details on this slide, I'd simply say all their capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row that I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to the quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells as had been the case in the second quarter. And then in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with 5 rigs we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through 2020. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition I feel like is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 20,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin -- that they're spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the commissions site and find out for yourself, but this is where simply outstanding wells. I've got graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show I feel like economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations, that would have lower lateral lengths and lower working interest. We have to go to work in these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that and would expect to be successful going in the future. 
The 13,000 acre principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, this transaction is a signal that we might be do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is opportunities like this don't come around very often that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. in fact since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths towards the feet [ph] for no cash exchanging hands. And so this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continuing to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch date I mentioned a minute ago. We're across all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But firstly, the Sale Ranch because is in the main focus of ours of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. that's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells of the 23 were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless we're looking at wells look like they're are about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction creates such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graph show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on the Version 3.0. 
First, in the North the top part of the slide, you can see we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during period of choke management. It's not unusual have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we wait the ability to handle this significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that you exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results I feel like encouraging so far. you have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
we're seeing similar results in the southern JV area where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells on the graph, essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. a product a less pressure as go further South. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see peaked above the 2.0 line, and we'll be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is owned, which we have not drilled nearly the same number, large sample sizes of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see it looks like roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we are evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and in the next year. We'll be getting back with details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are drilled 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of these, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. we can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production of various styles of the version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management of course still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only would we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, but I'll try to be brief with it. But suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C costs. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we got a 35% decrease in our D&C costs, despite the fact we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We also see continual completion efficiency gains. What we do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just obviously reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all the cost side of driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there is still based on the old contract rates and will start peeling off as we get into the 2018 -- 2017, 2018, where we can then expect to see some spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13 to give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up in the next few months. expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B and, a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe as I mentioned that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we reduced our D&C costs to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE which includes both LOE and taxes. Now we see the $4 to $6 per BOE. a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price index deck we phase, in this case, 50s, low 50s and gas drilling in low 3s. But the fact is we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are economic. And I think we would say that to the extent we get upside on version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, the last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is a specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year on to an average of 168,000 by virtue of that good performance. did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We have those mostly done [indiscernible] in this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells and had the plan pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get to the third quarter, as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs where we shut in wells, next door 2 wells being completed, that number is going to be about 35% higher as estimated compared to the second quarter. All of those lead to the notion that this third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells and choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter operationally. And I think that's a theme going forward as we should see how the results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."

I'm going to start on Slide 15 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to higher commodity prices at the end of June versus the end of the first quarter. So those losses after-tax basis totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter or $0.22. 
If you look at the page where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, really an overall exceptional quarter financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at the price realizations. The bars there, you can see that our prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter would be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. really from the 2 things. I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was, one, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract effective April 1. So that reduced our differentiation in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
looking down , you can see the effect of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost and improving our margins. You can see in the second quarter, our production costs per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to the centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives the asset teams have going on. reducing our saltwater disposal handling costs. Labor costs are down as we are really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We are using gas lift versus [indiscernible] or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing you'll notice your as we look at our third-party transportation costs on a per BOE basis, those are down really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, will see that go down in a per BOE basis. 
lastly as Tim also talked about with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp coming in low operating costs of $2 to $4 before taxes and 4 to 6 in total, weighted average basis. production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, new slide that we've added. really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs going into the future. It's really tremendous. Its cash margin in  the Permian [ph] are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs as Scott talked about really just drives the great returns we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecast cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production can generate great returns.
If you look at the time line in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and then also with prefunded with bond offering we did last December, and we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, although we reduce wells we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost of $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects lower run rate and the efforts to the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, , we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now at the point would say we are full run rate at lower tubular costs as well as cement costs as I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had and the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what the way I couch it. I know we very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions which, as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on wire line runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged of on a daily rental basis. For that matter, it's supervision. you're not on the job as long. don't need labor out there. don't need transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. very, very much cumulative effects. And then in essence what happens is they just have the effect of offsetting the fact completions are more expensive."

I would say we want to put the rigs to work, to do that to utilize that capital to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of 2018 period, '17, '18, '19 probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look and then at what you would do to the extent you're hired, we can put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point we each 45 vertical rigs running the Permian Basin at one time. I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do you want to bring forward. we certainly have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. we would have to spend more in infrastructure, and that's clear. Right now, we have [ph] baked into our internal modeling $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant at that rate. And that will probably be an 2018 or '19 scenario. We probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes come from or accelerated campaign. And so in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for higher rig count than is there . we might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, we feel like it's going to pay out really well long term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure. of course, in a higher cash flow model, we would be prepared to fund all of that."

Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells as would have gone up roughly 1/3 compared to where it was done in the past. And we're pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is water is going to be key. I think we identified it even a couple of years ago, you recall, that we talked about building out at that time was a massive water system. in response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is water, as we speak. we still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has investing capital in their water infrastructure. Now we are spending money this year on some of our mainline system. Some of you will want to do further work on our main lines at some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds as we move forward. I think we can do relatively piecemeal basis. But said we're pumping higher volumes it becomes more programmatic in terms of these volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get for not using any freshwater are making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs so to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to wear were not using any freshwater. We are doing a lot in terms of drilling and saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, [indiscernible] water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin where is to say this water is when you start turning the wells off for production, and comes back to you. We're pushing more water done in the systems are completion all that water comes back and you got a have a place to put it. Rather than an overbuilding the facilities at the least. This is tank batteries for water production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. this is produced water coming back at us rather than overbuilding infrastructure, and in doing so basically creating a situation where we never been able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choke back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we are seeing some cases you saw, 45 days or to 60 days. And when water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

We are spending 50 to 100 million probably every year in the water systems, so that's not that substantial. You look at gas processing facilities typically in our case, they run $140 million or so. We have 27% interest, so not very material. As I think you'll still see us go about it in somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period. today, we're at 12, going into 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. we're really not in the same scenario we were in.

However, this probably a limited we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on mass hydraulics. You have a lot of losses as you pump volumes down that horizontal pipe. And so the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs especially at the toe of the wells. And so I think we earned position testing this out. We believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at 13,000. We probably avoid diminishing terms all the way up to let's say 11 to 12.

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, there's one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done since downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years. We got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we're going to start off with Slide #3. In the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter, again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field in the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continued to enhance well productivity. Continued to see cost coming down in a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, great achievement, we're continuing to see [ph] (cut) production cost per BOE by 26% from first half 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? Simply because it's totally integrated our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We had it totally surrounded, allocated 14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying 58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal Wolfcamp B Wolfcamp area, well's between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. 3 of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1x through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from 17 to 20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. what's happened obviously, the [indiscernible] has dropped about $10 from $51, $52 down to $42. obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0. So does it have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't [ph] have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17. It could be in '18. It could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strips stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55 because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."
295224,342899174,1015321,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","thanks, Scott.

As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are",2830,"thanks, Scott. I'm turning to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having this -- not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going to the details on this slide, I'd simply say all their capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row that I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to the quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells as had been the case in the second quarter. And then in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with 5 rigs we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through 2020. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition I feel like is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 20,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin -- that they're spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the commissions site and find out for yourself, but this is where simply outstanding wells. I've got graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show I feel like economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations, that would have lower lateral lengths and lower working interest. We have to go to work in these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that and would expect to be successful going in the future. 
The 13,000 acre principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, this transaction is a signal that we might be do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is opportunities like this don't come around very often that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. in fact since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths towards the feet [ph] for no cash exchanging hands. And so this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continuing to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch date I mentioned a minute ago. We're across all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But firstly, the Sale Ranch because is in the main focus of ours of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. that's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells of the 23 were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless we're looking at wells look like they're are about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction creates such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graph show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on the Version 3.0. 
First, in the North the top part of the slide, you can see we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during period of choke management. It's not unusual have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we wait the ability to handle this significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that you exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results I feel like encouraging so far. you have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
we're seeing similar results in the southern JV area where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells on the graph, essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. a product a less pressure as go further South. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see peaked above the 2.0 line, and we'll be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is owned, which we have not drilled nearly the same number, large sample sizes of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see it looks like roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we are evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and in the next year. We'll be getting back with details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are drilled 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of these, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. we can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production of various styles of the version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management of course still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only would we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, but I'll try to be brief with it. But suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C costs. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we got a 35% decrease in our D&C costs, despite the fact we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We also see continual completion efficiency gains. What we do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just obviously reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all the cost side of driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there is still based on the old contract rates and will start peeling off as we get into the 2018 -- 2017, 2018, where we can then expect to see some spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13 to give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up in the next few months. expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B and, a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe as I mentioned that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we reduced our D&C costs to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE which includes both LOE and taxes. Now we see the $4 to $6 per BOE. a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price index deck we phase, in this case, 50s, low 50s and gas drilling in low 3s. But the fact is we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are economic. And I think we would say that to the extent we get upside on version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, the last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is a specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year on to an average of 168,000 by virtue of that good performance. did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We have those mostly done [indiscernible] in this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells and had the plan pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get to the third quarter, as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs where we shut in wells, next door 2 wells being completed, that number is going to be about 35% higher as estimated compared to the second quarter. All of those lead to the notion that this third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells and choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter operationally. And I think that's a theme going forward as we should see how the results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."

So those losses after-tax basis totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter or $0.22. 
If you look at the page where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, really an overall exceptional quarter financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at the price realizations. The bars there, you can see that our prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter would be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. really from the 2 things. I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was, one, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract effective April 1. So that reduced our differentiation in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
looking down , you can see the effect of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost and improving our margins. You can see in the second quarter, our production costs per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to the centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives the asset teams have going on. reducing our saltwater disposal handling costs. Labor costs are down as we are really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We are using gas lift versus [indiscernible] or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing you'll notice your as we look at our third-party transportation costs on a per BOE basis, those are down really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, will see that go down in a per BOE basis. 
lastly as Tim also talked about with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp coming in low operating costs of $2 to $4 before taxes and 4 to 6 in total, weighted average basis. production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, new slide that we've added. really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs going into the future. It's really tremendous. Its cash margin in  the Permian [ph] are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs as Scott talked about really just drives the great returns we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecast cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production can generate great returns.
If you look at the time line in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and then also with prefunded with bond offering we did last December, and we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, although we reduce wells we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost of $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects lower run rate and the efforts to the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, , we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now at the point would say we are full run rate at lower tubular costs as well as cement costs as I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had and the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what the way I couch it. I know we very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions which, as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on wire line runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged of on a daily rental basis. For that matter, it's supervision. you're not on the job as long. don't need labor out there. don't need transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. very, very much cumulative effects. And then in essence what happens is they just have the effect of offsetting the fact completions are more expensive."

I would say we want to put the rigs to work, to do that to utilize that capital to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of 2018 period, '17, '18, '19 probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look and then at what you would do to the extent you're hired, we can put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point we each 45 vertical rigs running the Permian Basin at one time. I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do you want to bring forward. we certainly have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. we would have to spend more in infrastructure, and that's clear. Right now, we have [ph] baked into our internal modeling $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant at that rate. And that will probably be an 2018 or '19 scenario. We probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes come from or accelerated campaign. And so in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for higher rig count than is there . we might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, we feel like it's going to pay out really well long term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure. of course, in a higher cash flow model, we would be prepared to fund all of that."

Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells as would have gone up roughly 1/3 compared to where it was done in the past. And we're pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is water is going to be key. I think we identified it even a couple of years ago, you recall, that we talked about building out at that time was a massive water system. in response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is water, as we speak. we still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has investing capital in their water infrastructure. Now we are spending money this year on some of our mainline system. Some of you will want to do further work on our main lines at some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds as we move forward. I think we can do relatively piecemeal basis. But said we're pumping higher volumes it becomes more programmatic in terms of these volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get for not using any freshwater are making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs so to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to wear were not using any freshwater. We are doing a lot in terms of drilling and saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, [indiscernible] water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin where is to say this water is when you start turning the wells off for production, and comes back to you. We're pushing more water done in the systems are completion all that water comes back and you got a have a place to put it. Rather than an overbuilding the facilities at the least. This is tank batteries for water production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. this is produced water coming back at us rather than overbuilding infrastructure, and in doing so basically creating a situation where we never been able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choke back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we are seeing some cases you saw, 45 days or to 60 days. And when water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

We have 27% interest, so not very material. As I think you'll still see us go about it in somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period. today, we're at 12, going into 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. we're really not in the same scenario we were in.

However, this probably a limited we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on mass hydraulics. You have a lot of losses as you pump volumes down that horizontal pipe. And so the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs especially at the toe of the wells.

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, there's one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done through this downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years. We got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on our -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we're going to start off with Slide #3. In the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter. Again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field in the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp, longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continuing to enhance well productivity. Continue to see cost coming down on a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, a great achievement, we're continuing to see production cost per BOE by 26% from first half of 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal well operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? It's simply because it's totally integrated among our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We have it, had it totally surrounded, allocated $14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made the announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying $58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, and you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal B Wolfcamp area, wells will be between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. Three of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity, expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1 through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from $17 to $20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. So what's happened obviously, the front month has dropped about $10, from $51, $52 down to $42. So obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0, so it doesn't have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17, it could be in '18, it could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strips stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55, because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."
295224,342899174,1015943,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and I'm turning now to Slide 5.

The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. Pad drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having this -- not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going through the details on this slide, I'd simply say all other capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells, and had been the case in the second quarter. And then, in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply a scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally, as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with the 5 rigs that we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through '20. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition, I feel like, is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 28,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin are such that they're spread from the Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus and main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the [indiscernible] commission site and find this out for yourself, but this is where we've made -- just really simply outstanding wells. I've got a graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like, based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show you, I feel like the economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations that would have lower lateral lengths and a lower working interest. We need to go to work on these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that, and would expect to be successful going into the future. 
The 13,000 acres principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage and then allow longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, does this, transaction is a signal that we might do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is, opportunities like this don't come around very often, that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you'll see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. In fact, since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres, and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths in terms of feet, for no cash exchanging hands. And so, this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continue to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch data I mentioned a minute ago. Where across of all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But firstly, the Sale Ranch, this is the main focus, of course, of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we've placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. That's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  It's when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells that, of the 23, were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see, as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are, on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only have 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless, we're looking at wells that look like they're about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we've drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction accretes such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graphs show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on Version 3.0. 
First, in the North, the top part of the slide, you can see that we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during the period of our choke management. It's not unusual now to have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we wait the ability to handle the significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production, without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results, I feel like, are encouraging so far. You have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
We're seeing similar results in the southern JV area, where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells on the graph, so essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup here in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. It's just a product of less pressure as you -- the further you go south. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where the early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see, they're peaking above the 2.0 line, and we'd be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is zoned, but which we have not drilled nearly the same number of the large sample size of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day, 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days, just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see, it looks like a, roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we're evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and into next year. We'll be getting back to you with more details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just to update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are shown, we've drilled with 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of this, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. We can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production, with various styles of Version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management, of course, still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only will we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we'll look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, but I'll try to be brief with it. But suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C cost. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we've got a 35% decrease in our D&C cost, despite the fact that we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We also see continual completion efficiency gains. One way to do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just simply reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all of the costs that are driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there are still based on the old contract rates, and will start peeling off as we get into 2018 -- 2017 and 2018, where we can then expect to see spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for, for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13, give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace, other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up here in the next few months. Expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B, and to a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe, as I mentioned, that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we've reduced our D&C cost to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and as Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE, which includes both LOE and taxes. Now we see that at $4 to $6 per BOE. This is a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price deck that we face, in this case, $50s, low $50s and gas drilling in low $3s. But the fact is, we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are highly economic. And I think, we would say, that to the extent that we get upside on Version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, this is my last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is just specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year up to an average of 168,000, just by virtue of that early good performance. We did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We have those mostly done, I hear, in this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells than had been planned. And we're pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get into the third quarter as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then, to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs, is where we shut in wells, next door, 2 wells being completed, that number's going to be about 35% higher as estimated, compared to the second quarter. All those lead to the notion that the third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected, compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells with choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter, operationally. And I think that's just a theme for -- going forward, as we should see outstanding results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."

I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher commodity prices at the end of June, versus the end of the first quarter. So those losses, after-tax basis, totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter, or $0.22. 
If you look at the middle of the page, where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as Tim and Scott have mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, so really an overall exceptional quarter, financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. The bars there, you can see that oil prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off of a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the end of the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter would be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. That's really from the 2 things, I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was: One, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract, it was effective April 1. So that reduced our differential in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
Looking down the bottom, you can see the impact of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from a derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost structure and improving our margins. You can see there in the second quarter, our production cost per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives that the asset teams have going on. We're reducing our saltwater disposal handling cost. Labor costs are down as we're really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We're using gas lift versus electricity or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing that you'll notice here as we look at our third-party transportation cost on a per BOE basis, those are down. It's really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis, as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, you'll see that go down on a per BOE basis. 
And then probably lastly, as Tim also talked about, with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp wells coming in, and their low operating cost of $2 to $4 before taxes and $4 to $6 in total, on a more weighted average basis, production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, it's a new slide that we've added. It really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs, going into the future. And it's really tremendous that you've got -- its cash margin in the Permian horizontals are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs that Scott talked about really just drives the great returns that we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today, with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and an undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecasted cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production and generate great returns.
If you look at the timeline in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity that it was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and then also was prefunded with the bond offering we did last December, and we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production, 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, up a little bit, due to the reduced wells that we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost at $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects the lower run rate and the effort to the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, Rachel, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now, at a point where we would say we're full run rate at lower tubular costs, as well as cement costs I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had at the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what I -- the way I couch it. I know that we -- we're very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions, which as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on the wire line runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged on a daily rental basis. And for that matter, it's supervision. You're not on the job as long, don't need labor out there, don't need transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. And so, those are very much cumulative effects. And then, in essence what happens is, they just have the effect of offsetting the fact that completions are more expensive."

What you've got to factor in though, is what's going to happen to the service cost. And we saw what happened in 2014. So that's why I said, personally looking at the model, I would rather oil stay in the $50, $55 range and keep costs in check -- but as a large shareholder. And so, but obviously as a -- Tim and the group have a lot of excess cash flow, then they'll bring forward more and more of those 20,000 locations."

So I would say we want to put the rigs to work, to do that, to utilize that capital, to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now, we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of the 2018 period, '17, '18, '19, probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look then, at what you would do to the extent you're higher than that, we can actually put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point at which we had 45 vertical rigs running in the Permian Basin at one time. So I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do we want to bring forward. We certainly do have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. We would have to spend more in infrastructure, that's clear. Right now, we have baked into our internal modeling, $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant, at that rate. And that would probably, a 2018 or '19 scenario. We'd probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so, if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes that would come from a more accelerated campaign. And so, in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for a higher rig count than is there today. We might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, that's -- we feel like, going to pay out really well in the long term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure. Of course, in a higher cash flow model, we'd be prepared to fund all that."

Today we only have 5 of our 7 fleets working, essentially full time. When things improve and/or maybe you can back to Doug's case, where we have $10 higher oil, we start adding rigs, then we got 2 fleets that are ready to go. And we would be at a point where 7 fleets can handle a higher rig count. The issue the industry's going to face, in terms of getting warm bodies out into the field, is substantial. And we are, by virtue of this vertical integration in pumping services, 100% insulated from that. So we can go to work immediately when we're ready to accelerate, not having to stumble around and find people to go operate our facilities and our equipment. I'll say the same thing about our sand business. We have ready sand available, especially have to expand, to meet a substantial amount of our needs. So we don't have to be dependent upon when things get crazy on sand, having to haul in a bunch of white sand from Wisconsin. That would be, in that scenario, twice as expensive as local Brady sand. So I think as we emerge from the downturn, I think we're actually better prepared because of vertical integration than not. That said, we're not making any money at vertical integration now, that's clear. That's all true of all the service companies. But we'll also be protecting ourselves in terms of rate and increases going forward by doing almost -- or a substantial amount of that work ourselves."

But I'm speaking to 3,000 engineers and geologists in San Antonio, talking about the Permian. And so there's an interesting slide deck will come out next week in that presentation. But my firm belief is the Permian's going to be the only driver of long-term oil growth in this country. And it's going to grow on up to about 5 million barrels a day from 2, even in a, this current strip, $55 price environment. So it's the best rock, obviously the best margins. And it'll provide essentially the only growth, long term. In the stack play and the SCOOP play, maybe the Niobrara will do a little bit. But the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, I think are -- there's no way they can recover to the levels that they've already had. So that's why I am confident the world needs the Permian. The Permian's going to be the future of the U.S. and help in world supply."

So the amo",589,"Well, you've got 2 or 3 questions built in there. I would say that we have a big multiplicative effect going on right now. Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells it's -- would have gone up roughly 1/3, compared to where it was done in the past. And we're already pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is, water's going to be a key. I think we had to identify, even a couple of years ago, you recall, when we talked about building out, at that time, was a massive water system. In response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward, especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is effluent water, as we speak. We still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has us investing capital in their water infrastructure. Now we are spending money this year on some of our mainline systems, but we would want -- we would want to do further work on our main lines at some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds, as we move forward. I think we can do it in a relatively piecemeal basis. But as I said, as we're pumping higher volumes, it becomes more problematic in terms of just volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get the course to where we're not using any freshwater. We're making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs, so -- to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to where we're not using any freshwater. Though we are doing a lot in terms of drilling new saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, this brackish water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin, which is to say, this water is when it's -- when you start turning the wells on for production, it comes back to you. We're pushing more water down in the system, with other completion while that water comes back, and you got a have a place to put it. Rather than overbuilding the facilities at the least, this is tank batteries for saltwater production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. Now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. This is produced water coming back at us. Rather than overbuilding the infrastructure, and in doing so, basically creating a situation where you'd never be able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choked back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we're seeing in some cases as you saw, and the day that showed you, 45 days or to 60 days. And when the water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

To use an example, our Midland contract will roughly require $100 million of investment. We're spending $50 million to $100 million probably every year anyway on the water systems, so that's not that substantial. You look at the gas processing facilities, typically in our case, they run $140 million or so. We have 27% interest, so that's not very material, so. I think you'll see us still go about in somewhat of a somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period. That's today, we're at 12, going to 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. So we're really not in the same scenario we were in. But nonetheless, we are pumping more volumes, and so there is that effect. But it will be something we have to continually spend money on. But I think we'll still do it more piecemeal.

And you only use the capacity built out in the extra cost for a minimal amount of time. So there's this trade-off between overcapitalizing a project and/or the need for current production. I think when we're in the range of 30 or 40 or 45 days, in terms of choking the wells back. That's really immaterial, I mean it does postpone our knowledge base for whatever that is, 30 days. But we really need 60, or 6 months or so anyway of production days to figure out how these wells are going to do. So we're not that worried about that postponement of 30 days of knowledge.

But in terms of, as you look at the capital requirements of all that, what we do know is we need to build tank bays there for 60 wells, essentially. So the cost efficiency comes, especially on the last, let's just say half of those wells, the first set of the wells will be subject to several million dollars' worth of capital just to put the facilities out there. The last wells are $70,000 to $150,000 capital, because of the fact the facility is already there, and we have to just put in some production equipment.

We're building that inventory up as I mentioned these are the trades and other methods, to make sure we can increase the lateral lengths. But as you look forward and you look at what lateral lengths seem to be optimal, our average in the Wolfcamp B, I think this year has now been edging up to about 9,500. I wouldn't be surprised to see that number go up from here, just on the basis of what I just mentioned. However, there's probably a limit at which we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably in the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on what amounts to hydraulics. It's -- you have a lot of line losses as you pump volumes down that long and horizontal pipe. And so you -- the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs, especially at the toe of the wells. And so I think we kind of earned our position having tested this out, that we believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at let's say 13,000. We probably avoid any kind of diminishing terms, all the way up to, let's say 11 to 12. So when we start seeing diminishing returns, I think is where we sort of call it a day and decide that's what we're going to call it. It's not a technical limit.

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, with one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done through this downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years, we got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on our -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we can start off with Slide #3. With the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter. Again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field during the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp, longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continuing to enhance well productivity. Continued to see cost coming down on a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, a great achievement, we're continuing to see production cost per BOE by 26% from first half of 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal well operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? It's simply because it's totally integrated among our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We have it -- had it totally surrounded, allocated $14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made the announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying $58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, and you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal B Wolfcamp area, wells will be between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. Three of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity, expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1 through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from $17 to $20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. So what's happened obviously, the front month has dropped about $10, from $51, $52 down to $42. So obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0, so it doesn't have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17, it could be in '18, it could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strip stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55, because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."
295224,342899174,1016663,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and I'm turning now to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so t",2900,"Thanks, Scott, and I'm turning now to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. Pad drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having -- this not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going through the details on this slide, I'd simply say all other capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells, and had been the case in the second quarter. And then, in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply a scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally, as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with the 5 rigs that we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through '20. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition, I feel like, is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 28,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin are such that they're spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus or main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the Railroad Commission site and find this out for yourself, but this is where we've made -- just really simply outstanding wells. I've got a graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like, based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show you, I feel like the economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations that would have lower lateral lengths and a lower working interest. We need to go to work on these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that, and would expect to be successful going into the future. 
The 13,000 acres principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage and allow longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, does this transaction, is it a signal that we might do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is, opportunities like this don't come around very often, that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you'll see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. In fact, since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres, and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths in terms of feet, for no cash exchanging hands. And so, this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continue to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch data I mentioned a minute ago. We're across of all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But first, for the Sale Ranch, this is the main focus, of course, of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we've placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. That's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  It's when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells that, of the 23, were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see, as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are, on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only have 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless, you're looking at wells that look like they're about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we've drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction accretes such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graphs show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on Version 3.0. 
First, in the North, the top part of the slide, you can see that we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during the period of our choke management. It's not unusual now to have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we await the ability to handle the significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production, without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results, I feel like, are encouraging so far. You'll have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
We're seeing similar results in the southern JV area, where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells; the graphs look essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup here in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. It's just a product of less pressure as you -- the further you go south. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where the early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see it peaking above the 2.0 line, and we'd be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is a zone for which we have not drilled nearly the same number or the large sample size of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day, 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days, just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see, it looks like a, roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we're evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and into next year. We'll be getting back to you with more details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just to update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are shown, we've drilled with 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of this, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. We can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production, with various styles of Version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see some more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management, of course, still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only will we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we'll look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, and I'll try to be brief with it, but suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from Version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C cost. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we've had a 35% decrease in our D&C cost, despite the fact that we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We will also see continual completion efficiency gains. One way to do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just simply reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all of the costs that are driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there are still based on the old contract rates, and will start peeling off as we get into 2018 -- 2017 and 2018, where we can then expect to see spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for, for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13, give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace, other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up here in the next few months. Expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B, and to a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe, as I mentioned, that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we've reduced our D&C cost to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and as Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE, which includes both LOE and [ph] taxes. Now we see that at $4 to $6 per BOE. This is a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price deck that we face, in this case, $50s, low $50s and gas really in low $3s. But the fact is, we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are highly economic. And I think, we would say, that to the extent that we get upside on Version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, this is my last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year up to an average of 168,000 BOE, just by virtue of that early good performance. We did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We'll have those mostly done, I hear, at the end of this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells than had been planned. And we're pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get into the third quarter as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then, to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs, this is where we shut in wells, next door, 2 wells being completed, that number's going to be about 35% higher as estimated, compared to the second quarter. All those lead to the notion that the third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected, compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells with choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter, operationally. And I think that sets a theme for going forward, as we should see outstanding results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."

I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher commodity prices at the end of June, versus the end of the first quarter. So those losses, after-tax basis, totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter, or $0.22. 
If you look at the middle of the page, where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as Tim and Scott both mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, so really an overall exceptional quarter, financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. On the bars there, you can see that oil prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off of a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the end of the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter will be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. That's really from the 2 things, I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was: One, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract, it was effective April 1. So that reduced our differential in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
Looking down the bottom, you can see the impact of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from a derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost structure and improving our margins. You can see there in the second quarter, our production costs per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives that the asset teams have going on. We're reducing our saltwater disposal handling cost. Labor costs are down as we're really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We're using gas lift versus electricity -- or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing that you'll notice here is when you look at our third-party transportation costs on a per BOE basis, those are down. It's really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis, as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, you'll see that go down on a per BOE basis. 
And then probably lastly, as Tim also talked about, with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp wells coming in, and their low operating cost of $2 to $4 before taxes and $4 to $6 in total, on a more weighted average basis, production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, it's a new slide that we've added. It really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs, going into the future. And it's really tremendous that you've got -- its cash margin in the Permian horizontals are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs that Scott talked about really just drives the great returns that we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today, with a net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and an undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecasted cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production and generate great returns.
If you look at the timeline in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity that was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and that also was prefunded with the bond offering we did last December, and that we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production, 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, up a little bit, due to the reduced wells that we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost at $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects the lower run rate and the efforts of the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, Rachel, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now, at a point where we would say we're full run rate at lower tubular costs, as well as cement costs I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had at the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what I -- the way I would couch it. I know that we -- we're very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions, which as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on the wire line runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged on a daily rental basis. And for that matter, it's supervision. You're not on the job as long, you don't need labor out there, you don't need any transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. And so, those are very much cumulative effects. And then, in essence what happens is, they just have the effect of offsetting the fact that completions are more expensive."

So I would say we want to put the rigs to work to do that, to utilize that capital, to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now, we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of the 2018 period, '17, '18, '19, probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look then, at what you would do to the extent you're higher than that, we can actually put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point at which we had 45 vertical rigs running in the Permian Basin at one time. So I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do we want to bring forward. We certainly would have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. We would have to spend more on infrastructure, that's clear. Right now, we have baked into our internal modeling, $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant, at that rate. And that would probably be a 2018 or '19 scenario. We'd probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so, if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes that would come from a more accelerated campaign. And so, in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for a higher rig count than is there today. We might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, that's -- we feel like, going to pay out really well in the long term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure. Of course, in a higher cash flow model, we'd be prepared to fund all that."

And we are, by virtue of this vertical integration in pumping services, 100% insulated from that. So we can go to work immediately when we're ready to accelerate, not have to stumble around and find people to go operate our facilities and our equipment. I'll say the same thing about our sand business. We have ready sand available, especially after we expand, to meet a substantial amount of our needs. So we don't have to be dependent upon when things get crazy on sand, having to haul in a bunch of white sand from Wisconsin that would be, in that scenario, twice as expensive as local Brady sand.

That said, we're not making any money at vertical integration now, that's clear. That's true of all the service companies.

And it's going to grow on up to about 5 million barrels a day from 2, even in a, this current strip, $55 price environment. So it's got the best rock, obviously the best margins. And it'll provide essentially the only growth, long term. I mean the stack play and the SCOOP play, maybe the Niobrara will do a little bit.

So the amo",590,"Well, you've got 2 or 3 questions built in there. I would say that we have a big multiplicative effect going on right now. Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells it's -- would have gone up roughly 1/3, compared to where it was done in the past. And we're already pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is, water's going to be a key. I think we had to identify it, even a couple of years ago, you recall, when we talked about building out, at that time, was a massive water system. In response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward, especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is effluent water, as we speak. We still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has us investing capital in their water infrastructure. We are spending money this year on some of our mainline systems, but we would want -- we would want to do further work on our main lines and some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds, as we move forward. I think we can do it in a relatively piecemeal basis. But as I said, as we're pumping higher volumes, it becomes more problematic in terms of just volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get the course to where we're not using any freshwater. We're making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs, so -- to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to where we're not using any freshwater. Though we are doing a lot in terms of drilling new saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, this brackish water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin, which is to say, this water is when it's -- when you start turning the wells on for production, it comes back to you. We're pushing more water down in the system, without a completion of how that water comes back, and youâ€™ve got to have a place to put it. Rather than overbuilding the facilities at the least, this is tank batteries for saltwater production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. Now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. This is produced water coming back at us. Rather than overbuilding the infrastructure, and in doing so, basically creating a situation where you'd never be able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choked back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we're seeing in some cases as you saw, and today that I showed you, 45 days or to 60 days. And when the water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

To use an example, our Midland contract will roughly require $100 million of investment. We're spending $50 million to $100 million probably every year anyway on the water systems, so that's not that substantial. You look at gas processing facilities, typically in our case, they run $140 million or so. We have 27% interest, so that's not very material, so. I think you'll see us still go about in somewhat of a somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period, I'd say. Today, we're at 12, going to 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. So we're really not in the same scenario we were in. But nonetheless, we are pumping more volumes, and so there is that effect. But it will be something we have to continually spend money on. But I think we'll still do it more piecemeal. You're not going to see us coming out with a huge, multi $100 million water project any given year."

And you only use the capacity you built out and the extra cost for a minimal amount of time. So there's this trade-off between overcapitalizing a project and/or the need for current production. I think when we're in the range of 30 or 40 or 45 days, in terms of choking the wells back. That's really immaterial, I mean it does postpone our knowledge base for whatever that is, 30 days. But we really need 60 -- or 6 months or so anyway of production days to figure out how these wells are going to do. So we're not that worried about that postponement of 30 days of knowledge.

So that's a systematic approach we're taking. That means, we also need to come back later on, for example, lower Spraberry Shale zones and so on. But in terms of, as you look at the capital requirements of all that, what we do know is when we build tank bays they're for 60 wells, essentially. So the cost efficiency comes, especially on the last, let's just say half of those wells, the first set of the wells will be subject to several million dollars' worth of capital just to put the facilities out there. The last wells are $70,000 to $150,000 capital, because of the fact the facility is already there, and we had to just put in some production equipment. So you actually do see improving returns if you look at simple, identical well metrics, the further you go into the program. We are building for the future, what we're saying is, we don't want to overbuild for the future."

We're building that inventory up as I mentioned, vis a vis trades and other methods, to make sure we can increase the lateral lengths. But as you look forward and you look at what lateral lengths seem to be optimal, our average in the Wolfcamp B, I think this year has now been edging up to about 9,500 feet. I wouldn't be surprised to see that number go up from here, just on the basis of what I just mentioned. However, there's probably a limit at which we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably in the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on what amounts to hydraulics. It's -- you have a lot of line losses as you pump volumes down that long of a horizontal pipe. And so you -- the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs, especially at the toe of the wells. And so I think we kind of earned our position having tested this out, that we believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at let's say 13,000 feet. We probably avoid any kind of diminishing terms, all the way out to, let's say 11,000 to 12,000 feet. So when we start seeing diminishing returns, I think is where we sort of call it a day and decide that's what we're going to call it. It's not a technical limit. It's just more of an economic limit."

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, with one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done through this downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years, we got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on our -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we can start off with Slide #3. With the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter. Again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field during the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp, longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continuing to enhance well productivity. Continued to see cost coming down on a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, a great achievement, we're continuing to see production cost per BOE by 26% from first half of 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal well operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? It's simply because it's totally integrated among our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We have it -- had it totally surrounded, allocated $14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made the announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying $58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, and you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal B Wolfcamp area, wells will be between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. Three of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity, expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1 through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from $17 to $20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. So what's happened obviously, the front month has dropped about $10, from $51, $52 down to $42. So obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0, so it doesn't have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17, it could be in '18, it could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strip stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55, because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."
295224,342899174,1018892,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and I'm turning now to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so t",2900,"Thanks, Scott, and I'm turning now to Slide 5. The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. Pad drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having -- this not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going through the details on this slide, I'd simply say all other capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells, and had been the case in the second quarter. And then, in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply a scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally, as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with the 5 rigs that we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through '20. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition, I feel like, is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 28,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin are such that they're spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus or main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the Railroad Commission site and find this out for yourself, but this is where we've made -- just really simply outstanding wells. I've got a graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like, based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show you, I feel like the economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations that would have lower lateral lengths and a lower working interest. We need to go to work on these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that, and would expect to be successful going into the future. 
The 13,000 acres principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage and allow longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, does this transaction, is it a signal that we might do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is, opportunities like this don't come around very often, that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you'll see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. In fact, since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres, and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths in terms of feet, for no cash exchanging hands. And so, this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continue to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch data I mentioned a minute ago. We're across of all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But first, for the Sale Ranch, this is the main focus, of course, of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we've placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. That's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  It's when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells that, of the 23, were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see, as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are, on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only have 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless, you're looking at wells that look like they're about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we've drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction accretes such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graphs show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on Version 3.0. 
First, in the North, the top part of the slide, you can see that we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during the period of our choke management. It's not unusual now to have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we await the ability to handle the significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production, without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results, I feel like, are encouraging so far. You'll have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
We're seeing similar results in the southern JV area, where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells; the graphs look essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup here in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. It's just a product of less pressure as you -- the further you go south. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where the early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see it peaking above the 2.0 line, and we'd be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is a zone for which we have not drilled nearly the same number or the large sample size of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day, 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days, just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see, it looks like a, roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we're evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and into next year. We'll be getting back to you with more details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just to update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are shown, we've drilled with 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of this, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. We can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production, with various styles of Version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see some more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management, of course, still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only will we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we'll look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, and I'll try to be brief with it, but suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from Version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C cost. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we've had a 35% decrease in our D&C cost, despite the fact that we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We will also see continual completion efficiency gains. One way to do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just simply reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all of the costs that are driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there are still based on the old contract rates, and will start peeling off as we get into 2018 -- 2017 and 2018, where we can then expect to see spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for, for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13, give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace, other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up here in the next few months. Expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B, and to a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe, as I mentioned, that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we've reduced our D&C cost to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and as Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE, which includes both LOE and [ph] taxes. Now we see that at $4 to $6 per BOE. This is a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price deck that we face, in this case, $50s, low $50s and gas really in low $3s. But the fact is, we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are highly economic. And I think, we would say, that to the extent that we get upside on Version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, this is my last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year up to an average of 168,000 BOE, just by virtue of that early good performance. We did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We'll have those mostly done, I hear, at the end of this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells than had been planned. And we're pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get into the third quarter as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then, to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs, this is where we shut in wells, next door, 2 wells being completed, that number's going to be about 35% higher as estimated, compared to the second quarter. All those lead to the notion that the third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected, compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells with choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter, operationally. And I think that sets a theme for going forward, as we should see outstanding results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."

I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share.

I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher commodity prices at the end of June, versus the end of the first quarter. So those losses, after-tax basis, totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter, or $0.22. 
If you look at the middle of the page, where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as Tim and Scott both mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, so really an overall exceptional quarter, financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. On the bars there, you can see that oil prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off of a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the end of the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter will be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. That's really from the 2 things, I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was: One, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract, it was effective April 1. So that reduced our differential in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
Looking down the bottom, you can see the impact of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from a derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost structure and improving our margins. You can see there in the second quarter, our production costs per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives that the asset teams have going on. We're reducing our saltwater disposal handling cost. Labor costs are down as we're really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We're using gas lift versus electricity -- or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing that you'll notice here is when you look at our third-party transportation costs on a per BOE basis, those are down. It's really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis, as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, you'll see that go down on a per BOE basis. 
And then probably lastly, as Tim also talked about, with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp wells coming in, and their low operating cost of $2 to $4 before taxes and $4 to $6 in total, on a more weighted average basis, production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, it's a new slide that we've added. It really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs, going into the future. And it's really tremendous that you've got -- its cash margin in the Permian horizontals are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs that Scott talked about really just drives the great returns that we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today, with a net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and an undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecasted cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production and generate great returns.
If you look at the timeline in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity that was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and that also was prefunded with the bond offering we did last December, and that we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production, 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, up a little bit, due to the reduced wells that we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost at $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects the lower run rate and the efforts of the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, Rachel, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now, at a point where we would say we're full run rate at lower tubular costs, as well as cement costs I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had at the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what I -- the way I would couch it. I know that we -- we're very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions, which as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on the wire line runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged on a daily rental basis. And for that matter, it's supervision. You're not on the job as long, you don't need labor out there, you don't need any transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. And so, those are very much cumulative effects. And then, in essence what happens is, they just have the effect of offsetting the fact that completions are more expensive."

So I would say we want to put the rigs to work to do that, to utilize that capital, to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now, we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of the 2018 period, '17, '18, '19, probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look then, at what you would do to the extent you're higher than that, we can actually put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point at which we had 45 vertical rigs running in the Permian Basin at one time. So I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do we want to bring forward. We certainly would have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. We would have to spend more on infrastructure, that's clear. Right now, we have baked into our internal modeling, $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant, at that rate. And that would probably be a 2018 or '19 scenario. We'd probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so, if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes that would come from a more accelerated campaign. And so, in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for a higher rig count than is there today. We might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, that's -- we feel like, going to pay out really well in the long term.

If you look at -- the immediate advantage we have, is when things improve -- today we only have 5 of our 7 fleets working, essentially full time. When things improve and/or maybe you get back to Doug's case, where we have $10 higher oil to start adding rigs, then we've got 2 fleets that are ready to go. And we would be at a point where 7 fleets could handle a higher rig count. The issue the industry's going to face, in terms of getting warm bodies out into the field, is substantial. And we are, by virtue of this vertical integration in pumping services, 100% insulated from that. So we can go to work immediately when we're ready to accelerate, not have to stumble around and find people to go operate our facilities and our equipment. I'll say the same thing about our sand business. We have ready sand available, especially after we expand, to meet a substantial amount of our needs. So we don't have to be dependent upon when things get crazy on sand, having to haul in a bunch of white sand from Wisconsin that would be, in that scenario, twice as expensive as local Brady sand. So I think as we emerge from the downturn, I think we're actually better prepared because of vertical integration than not. That said, we're not making any money at vertical integration now, that's clear. That's true of all the service companies. But we'll also be protecting ourselves in terms of rate and increases going forward by doing almost -- or a substantial amount of that work ourselves."

So the amo",590,"Well, you've got 2 or 3 questions built in there. I would say that we have a big multiplicative effect going on right now. Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells it's -- would have gone up roughly 1/3, compared to where it was done in the past. And we're already pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is, water's going to be a key. I think we had to identify it, even a couple of years ago, you recall, when we talked about building out, at that time, was a massive water system. In response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward, especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is effluent water, as we speak. We still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has us investing capital in their water infrastructure. We are spending money this year on some of our mainline systems, but we would want -- we would want to do further work on our main lines and some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds, as we move forward. I think we can do it in a relatively piecemeal basis. But as I said, as we're pumping higher volumes, it becomes more problematic in terms of just volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get the course to where we're not using any freshwater. We're making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs, so -- to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to where we're not using any freshwater. Though we are doing a lot in terms of drilling new saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, this brackish water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin, which is to say, this water is when it's -- when you start turning the wells on for production, it comes back to you. We're pushing more water down in the system, without a completion of how that water comes back, and you've got to have a place to put it. Rather than overbuilding the facilities at the least, this is tank batteries for saltwater production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. Now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. This is produced water coming back at us. Rather than overbuilding the infrastructure, and in doing so, basically creating a situation where you'd never be able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choked back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we're seeing in some cases as you saw, and today that I showed you, 45 days or to 60 days. And when the water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

To use an example, our Midland contract will roughly require $100 million of investment. We're spending $50 million to $100 million probably every year anyway on the water systems, so that's not that substantial. You look at gas processing facilities, typically in our case, they run $140 million or so. We have 27% interest, so that's not very material, so. I think you'll see us still go about in somewhat of a somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period, I'd say. Today, we're at 12, going to 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. So we're really not in the same scenario we were in.

I think I mentioned that Charles, there is a trade-off that has to do with not overbuilding when you only -- we see this all the time in gas processing, as an example, where you build a gas plant. And if you're not careful, you build it for the capacity that exists one day, and you see producing -- production declines. And you only use the capacity you built out and the extra cost for a minimal amount of time. So there's this trade-off between overcapitalizing a project and/or the need for current production. I think when we're in the range of 30 or 40 or 45 days, in terms of choking the wells back. That's really immaterial, I mean it does postpone our knowledge base for whatever that is, 30 days. But we really need 60 -- or 6 months or so anyway of production days to figure out how these wells are going to do. So we're not that worried about that postponement of 30 days of knowledge. I think that's doable -- that's reasonable cost of the trade."

So that's a systematic approach we're taking. That means, we also need to come back later on, for example, lower Spraberry Shale zones and so on. But in terms of, as you look at the capital requirements of all that, what we do know is when we build tank bays they're for 60 wells, essentially. So the cost efficiency comes, especially on the last, let's just say half of those wells, the first set of the wells will be subject to several million dollars' worth of capital just to put the facilities out there. The last wells are $70,000 to $150,000 capital, because of the fact the facility is already there, and we had to just put in some production equipment. So you actually do see improving returns if you look at simple, identical well metrics, the further you go into the program.

We're building that inventory up as I mentioned, vis a vis trades and other methods, to make sure we can increase the lateral lengths. But as you look forward and you look at what lateral lengths seem to be optimal, our average in the Wolfcamp B, I think this year has now been edging up to about 9,500 feet. I wouldn't be surprised to see that number go up from here, just on the basis of what I just mentioned. However, there's probably a limit at which we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably in the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on what amounts to hydraulics. It's -- you have a lot of line losses as you pump volumes down that long of a horizontal pipe. And so you -- the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs, especially at the toe of the wells. And so I think we kind of earned our position having tested this out, that we believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at let's say 13,000 feet. We probably avoid any kind of diminishing terms, all the way out to, let's say 11,000 to 12,000 feet. So when we start seeing diminishing returns, I think is where we sort of call it a day and decide that's what we're going to call it. It's not a technical limit. It's just more of an economic limit."

Good morning. This is the first call since my announcement to retire as CEO. I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.

I want to give a few comments before I go over the first 2 slides.  I may be setting a record, but I'm getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times 4, it's about 100 years, with one left. I think every leader wants to retire and pick the best time. I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done through this downturn in the last 2 years, '16 is obviously the best time. The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet. What's more important, with Tim and the management team, they've been with me over 20 years, we got the best management team in the business. And I'll make a few comments on our -- the best long-term growth profile of any large-cap company out there. 
I've only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim. So we can start off with Slide #3. With the quarter, the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Production above, way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 58% oil, that's up from 55% oil in the first quarter. Again, above the guidance, an increase of 11,000 barrels a day or 5% versus first quarter. Oil production up 12,000 barrels a day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.  
Growth driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.  We placed 69 wells on production in that field during the second quarter with continuing strong performance. 37 of those wells benefited from the Version 3.0 completion optimization. 
Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in this Spraberry/Wolfcamp, longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continuing to enhance well productivity. Continued to see cost coming down on a per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about. 
Again, a great achievement, we're continuing to see production cost per BOE by 26% from first half of 2015 to first half of 2016. You'll see Rich talk more about it and also Tim. But what's amazing to me is that the horizontal well operating costs, excluding taxes, is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.
A lot of people are asking why, with a deep inventory, why we are acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million? It's simply because it's totally integrated among our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. They -- most of the competition couldn't bid on this because they couldn't get longer laterals. We have it -- had it totally surrounded, allocated $14,000 per acre. And what's interesting right after we made the announcement on the acquisition, somebody is paying $58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in the third quarter, and you'll see from some of Tim's slides, this is the best area in our horizontal B Wolfcamp area, wells will be between 1.5 and 2 million BOEs.
Going to Slide #4. The company plans to increase its horizontal rig count, as we announced already, from 12 to 17 rigs in the North during the second half of 2016. First rig in September, followed by 2 rigs in October and 2 more rigs in November. Three of those rigs will be dedicated to the Sale Ranch area once locations are permitted. 
We already talked about a slight increase in capital expenditures, about $100 million, to $2.1 billion. And again, obviously as it takes us a good 130 -- 125 to 135 days to bring wells on, production, we won't see any production until 2017. But we are increasing our '16 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus, again due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp well productivity.
The 17-rig activity, expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again, funded by our strong investment-grade, really the best balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid-July strip prices. 
This last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what's most important in this whole slide deck.  The company expects to deliver compound annual production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below 1 through 2020 at mid-July strip prices. Now what's most important is that the strip price from $17 to $20 has only dropped about $2 to $3. So what's happened obviously, the front month has dropped about $10, from $51, $52 down to $42. So obviously we get asked all the time, do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity. The answer is no. This long-term forecast is Version 2.0, so it doesn't have any upside from 3.0? It doesn't have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we can talk about it, but the company is well on its way to growing 15% well past 2020. 
We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan once oil price gets to $55. That could be in '17, it could be in '18, it could be '19. We're using '18 here. That's also what's amazing to me. So I prefer long term that the strip stays where it is, somewhere in the $50 to $55, because Pioneer can outperform every independent, especially the large cap. 
I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on the CapEx."

The capital spending program for this year remains intact. As Scott already mentioned, we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion, another $100 million or so, to account for the 5 rigs or so that are going to be added here in the second half of the year. Pad drilling, as he mentioned, will have the effect of having -- this not impacting 2016 production, but rather it will start to come into 2017 when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially, rather than going through the details on this slide, I'd simply say all other capital items remain essentially the same for the year. And they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on out.
Turning to Slide 6. We've updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells. And this is the third in a row I think we could say so. 
Looking first of all to quarter, Scott already mentioned, we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that, of course is bumping the year-end -- the year total production rates up to about 231,000 BOE per day, again, just tweaking it up by virtue of the most recent results. 
Third quarter, we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There's a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to do with the fact we're going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just by virtue of the schedule. We're currently planning to POP 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter. And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that will be shut in waiting, while we're fracking nearby wells, and had been the case in the second quarter. And then, in addition to which, we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells, to make sure we don't overburden our facilities. All those are just coming in 2016's third quarter. 2016's fourth quarter looks exceedingly strong. So this is just simply a scheduling-related matter that has this effect.
Finally, as a result of what Scott had mentioned, with the 5 rigs that we're adding, and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017, that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally, if you look at the most right-hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year over the period 2018 through '20. And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than Version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from an operational standpoint, and we plan to execute it accordingly.
Turning now to Slide 7. The recently announced acquisition, I feel like, is very opportunistic. And it has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. The 28,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin are such that they're spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into northern Upton County. But the main focus or main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres, as shown on the map in the black circle. This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the Railroad Commission site and find this out for yourself, but this is where we've made -- just really simply outstanding wells. I've got a graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. 
Now what this transaction does is add 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest. Each of those wells, we feel like, based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million worth of NPV. So right there, that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations. This goes to show you, I feel like the economics of this transaction are really outstanding. 
It also adds other locations, about 80 Wolfcamp B locations that would have lower lateral lengths and a lower working interest. We need to go to work on these areas by declaring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals. But we've been very successful on that, and would expect to be successful going into the future. 
The 13,000 acres principally you see in the South would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage and allow longer laterals to be drilled. But people do ask us all the time, does this transaction, is it a signal that we might do more of these type of transactions. The first thing I'd say is, opportunities like this don't come around very often, that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage. However, you never say never. But the more frequent deals you'll see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of acreage that I mentioned a minute ago, in order to drill longer laterals. In fact, since early part of 2015, we've traded 19,000 gross acres, and have acquired 3.2 million gross lateral lengths in terms of feet, for no cash exchanging hands. And so, this is where there's huge value added, and you'll see us continue to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.
Going to Slide 8. This is the Sale Ranch data I mentioned a minute ago. We're across of all the acreage of course, continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization. But first, for the Sale Ranch, this is the main focus, of course, of the Devon transaction. Over time in this field, we have -- this area of the field, we've placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production. That's over the last 2 years. That's wells that are over 7,000 feet. The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all Version 1.0 completions. And you can see that they, in the gray line, are indeed above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly.  It's when you start looking at the 23 wells performance, in the blue, where we start to see the benefits of optimization, many of these wells that, of the 23, were subject to Version 2.0 completions. And you can see, as a result, these wells on average are exceeding that 1 million barrels type curve by about 60%. 
And then finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are, on average, 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length. These are phenomenal wells. We only have 2 of those wells currently on production. But nonetheless, you're looking at wells that look like they're about 2 million barrel wells, at least in terms of early stage production. So I think we're very confident in this area, and we've drilled a lot of wells in the area. And that's why we think the Devon transaction accretes such great value to us. And as we learn and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area, I think this Sale Ranch acreage is expected to show very strong results going forward.
Then on Slide 9, this is more granularity, especially on completion optimization in the Wolfcamp B. This is both in the North and the South. You'll notice that the graphs show some early results, about 3 months of results or so on Version 3.0. 
First, in the North, the top part of the slide, you can see that we had about 14 wells that were subjected to Version 3.0 style completions. The first 45 days or so of that data really needs to be tossed out as N/A simply because it's during the period of our choke management. It's not unusual now to have some wells choke for 2 months, just as we await the ability to handle the significantly increased volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the Version 2.0 results, they're outstanding, of course, probably 35% improvement over the 1 million barrel type curve. But we're looking forward to see the provision of the all version 3.0 wells. You can see we've had the wells we put on production only on production, without being choked back for about a month. So they're starting to show results that exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect. And those results, I feel like, are encouraging so far. You'll have to stay tuned as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.
We're seeing similar results in the southern JV area, where you have a mix again of Version 2.0 and 3.0 wells; the graphs look essentially the same. We don't see quite as much pickup here in the Version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South. It's just a product of less pressure as you -- the further you go south. But nonetheless, we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line, again a situation where the early part of the well was choked. But we're now starting to see it peaking above the 2.0 line, and we'd be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we'll know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what Version 3.0 can contribute on a per-well basis. But suffice it to say, these early results are positive.
Now turning to Slide 10. Here, we're talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A of course is a zone for which we have not drilled nearly the same number or the large sample size of wells compared to the B. But we're showing similar style of results. Wolfcamp A, early day, 2.0 wells now after having been in production, in some cases almost as long as a year, have shown about a 25% productivity improvement. While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as was seen in the Wolfcamp B. That is early days, just completing their choke management period. 
In the Southern Wolfcamp area, there's only been 1 well drilled. You can say -- you can see, it looks like a, roughly 1 million BOE type curve. We have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A. 
But based on all these results that we've begun to see for version 3.0, we're evaluating whether to expand the current 80-well campaign to a larger number of wells, as we add rigs here in the latter part of the year and into next year. We'll be getting back to you with more details on exactly how many wells we're going to expand that to as the team completes their work. 
Turning to Slide 11. This is lower Spraberry Shale data, just to update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are shown, we've drilled with 2.0 version style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the 1 million BOE type curve. 
I think the takeaways from all of this, these slides, are significant in the sense that we now have 150 wells with version 2.0 data. We can pretty definitively say that's going to be the new style of completions at a minimum. And we have this 80-well campaign going. 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production, with various styles of Version 3.0 optimization. They're looking good, but we have to see some more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they're going to be. 
Choke management, of course, still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think it's the case that not only will we put the 43 additional wells on using 3.0, but we'll look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the latter part of this year and into next year.
Slide 12, turning to cost efficiencies. Scott covered some of this, and I'll try to be brief with it, but suffice it to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from Version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the costs are higher as a result of that, we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C cost. You see here over the last 1.5 years or so, we've had a 35% decrease in our D&C cost, despite the fact that we're adding costs, and not insignificant costs, when we're doing Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are a lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubulars and cement pricing since substantial reductions this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions. We will also see continual completion efficiency gains. One way to do that is to reduce our nonproductive time where we just simply reduce the number of days on the jobs. And that reduces all of the costs that are driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor. So we're seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to that period of the business as well. 
But we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates there are still based on the old contract rates, and will start peeling off as we get into 2018 -- 2017 and 2018, where we can then expect to see spot rates for rigs, which we've been waiting for, for some time.
I'm going to turn now to Slide 13, give you some details regarding the Spraberry/Wolfcamp drilling campaign as it proceeds. It's really on pace, other than for the adding of the 5 rigs coming up here in the next few months. Expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, still predominantly Wolfcamp B, and to a lesser extent, Wolfcamp A. 
We believe, as I mentioned, that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but we'll know a lot more about 3.0 as we go. But we've reduced our D&C cost to about $7 million. That's assuming a 9,000-foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. 
Really importantly, and as Scott alluded to this, is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even last quarter, we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE, which includes both LOE and [ph] taxes. Now we see that at $4 to $6 per BOE. This is a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor costs. The result of which is very high IRRs, even though we're in this price deck that we face, in this case, $50s, low $50s and gas really in low $3s. But the fact is, we've been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiencies to the point where these wells still are highly economic. And I think, we would say, that to the extent that we get upside on Version 3.0 and/or any improvement in commodity prices, those returns only improve. Turning to Slide 14, this is my last slide. This is a slide showing how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is specifically on the Permian Basin, 167,000 BOE per day. That allows us to bump the whole year up to an average of 168,000, just by virtue of that early good performance. We did put 69 wells on production, the vast majority in the northern area. We are completing the southern area wells. We'll have those mostly done, I hear, at the end of this quarter. 
And we did complete more wells than had been planned. And we're pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter. That number is lower as we get into the third quarter as I mentioned, about 50 wells to be put on production. And then, to the extent that we have shut in volumes from offset fracs, this is where we shut in wells, next door, 2 wells being completed, that number's going to be about 35% higher as estimated, compared to the second quarter. All those lead to the notion that the third quarter will be more flattish than we would have expected, compared to the second quarter, but it has to do with all these reasons, including the curtailing of wells with choke management. 
So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter, operationally. And I think that sets a theme for going forward, as we should see outstanding results from these assets in the future.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook."
295224,342899174,1019108,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share.

I'm going to start on Slide 15, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher commodity prices at the end of June, versus the end of the first quarter. So those losses, after-tax basis, totaled $231 million or $1.41 per diluted share. So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses, we are at $37 million loss for the quarter, or $0.22. 
If you look at the middle of the page, where we show the results for the quarter versus our guidance, you're going to see that production, as Tim and Scott both mentioned, was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we're on the positive side of the guidance on a number of these things or within guidance, so really an overall exceptional quarter, financially. One of the points to mention is that we had just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. On the bars there, you can see that oil prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit off of a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel, primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we experienced during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7%, although we did see gas prices jump towards the end of the second quarter. So we hope the third quarter will be better than the first and second quarter. 
If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter, it was down $1.20 from where we were in the first quarter. That's really from the 2 things, I think we mentioned these in first quarter call was: One, our Eagle Ford condensate contract. We had a new contract, it was effective April 1. So that reduced our differential in Eagle Ford condensate. So that helped on that front. And we also saw tighter Midland-Cushing differentials for the quarter.
Looking down the bottom, you can see the impact of our derivatives. We still had a great quarter from a derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 from derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first 6 months of the year. 
Turning to Slide 17, look at production costs. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the asset teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost structure and improving our margins. You can see there in the second quarter, our production costs per BOE are down 9% from the first quarter. Base LOE is down about 5% due to centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives that the asset teams have going on. We're reducing our saltwater disposal handling cost. Labor costs are down as we're really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We're using gas lift versus electricity -- or submersible pumps on to support our wells, and lower fuel and electric costs as well. 
The other thing that you'll notice here is when you look at our third-party transportation costs on a per BOE basis, those are down. It's really due to our declining Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on a weighted average basis, as the company continues to grow and it becomes a smaller portion of it, you'll see that go down on a per BOE basis. 
And then probably lastly, as Tim also talked about, with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp wells coming in, and their low operating cost of $2 to $4 before taxes and $4 to $6 in total, on a more weighted average basis, production costs will continue to benefit from those wells as we add more of that production in the future.
Turning to Slide 18, which really sums up the last 2 slides from a margin standpoint, it's a new slide that we've added. It really highlights why we have 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, and why we're comfortable adding rigs, going into the future. And it's really tremendous that you've got -- its cash margin in the Permian horizontals are more than twice of our -- any of our other assets. And the low operating costs that Scott talked about really just drives the great returns that we can generate from these assets.
Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position. Excellent position, probably the best in the industry today, with a net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million and an undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecasted cash flow of 0.2x. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production and generate great returns.
If you look at the timeline in the middle there, you'll see the 2016 debt maturity that was actually due in mid-July. So that was paid with cash on hand. We also have a maturity that's due in March of 2017, and that also was prefunded with the bond offering we did last December, and that we paid off with cash on hand as well.
Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance. Daily production, 232,000 to 237,000 BOEs. As Tim just recently talked about, it is primarily flattish for the quarter, up a little bit, due to the reduced wells that we're going to place on production during the quarter. And then the offset wells will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter. 
Production cost at $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE, really reflects the lower run rate and the efforts of the asset teams to continue to bring those costs down. 
The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So I won't go through those in detail, but they're there for your review. 
And so with that, Rachel, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions."

In other words, we're just now, at a point where we would say we're full run rate at lower tubular costs, as well as cement costs I mentioned. Of course, it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had at the end of last year. So now we're at a run rate which is just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year. But there's really a lot more of the same as what I -- the way I would couch it. I know that we -- we're very substantially reduced our nonproductive time completions, which as I mentioned in here, I think our nonproductive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter. And it has to do with all aspects of the completion. So it has to do with reducing time on the wireline runs, as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can. And when you start reducing nonproductive time that substantially, it has a very positive effect on things that we get charged on a daily rental basis. And for that matter, it's supervision. You're not on the job as long, you don't need labor out there, you don't need any transport, you don't need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. And so, those are very much cumulative effects. And then, in essence what happens is, they just have the effect of offsetting the fact that completions are more expensive."

What I'm really trying to understand what the constraints are. $55 oil obviously is fairly modest, I think by most people's long-term expectations. So what happens if oil prices are substantially higher than that? Let's assume $65, $70. What would Pioneer look like there?"

What you've got to factor in though, is what's going to happen to the service cost. And we saw what happened in 2014. So that's why I said, I personally looking at the model, I would rather oil stay in the $50, $55 range and keep costs in check -- but as a large shareholder. And so, but obviously as a -- if Tim and the group have a lot of excess cash flow, then they'll bring forward more and more of those 20,000 locations."

So I would say we want to put the rigs to work to do that, to utilize that capital, to the extent the returns are as good as they are today, even at lower prices. Right now, we have baked in adding 3 to 5 rigs per year in -- sort of the 2018 period, '17, '18, '19, probably in that range. And when we do that, we have dramatic growth increases that we've already shown you. I think if you look then, at what you would do to the extent you're higher than that, we can actually put more rigs to work out there than 3 per year, that's clear. There's a point at which we had 45 vertical rigs running in the Permian Basin at one time. So I think we can actually physically get this done. I think it's just a matter of deciding how much of this PV do we want to bring forward. We certainly would have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground. We would have to spend more on infrastructure, that's clear. Right now, we have baked into our internal modeling, $250 million to $300 million a year of other PP&E for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant, at that rate. And that would probably be a 2018 or '19 scenario. We'd probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so, if that were to occur, just to deal with the additional volumes that would come from a more accelerated campaign. And so, in the water system of course, it's pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for a higher rig count than is there today. We might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course, that's -- we feel like, going to pay out really well in the long term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure. Of course, in a higher cash flow model, we'd be prepared to fund all that."

When things improve and/or maybe you get back to Doug's case, where we have $10 higher oil to start adding rigs, then we've got 2 fleets that are ready to go. And we would be at a point where 7 fleets could handle a higher rig count. The issue the industry's going to face, in terms of getting warm bodies out into the field, is substantial. And we are, by virtue of this vertical integration in pumping services, 100% insulated from that. So we can go to work immediately when we're ready to accelerate, not have to stumble around and find people to go operate our facilities and our equipment. I'll say the same thing about our sand business. We have ready sand available, especially after we expand, to meet a substantial amount of our needs. So we don't have to be dependent upon when things get crazy on sand, having to haul in a bunch of white sand from Wisconsin that would be, in that scenario, twice as expensive as local Brady sand. So I think as we emerge from the downturn, I think we're actually better prepared because of vertical integration than not. That said, we're not making any money at vertical integration now, that's clear. That's true of all the service companies. But we'll also be protecting ourselves in terms of rate and increases going forward by doing almost -- or a substantial amount of that work ourselves."

So the amo",590,"Well, you've got 2 or 3 questions built in there. I would say that we have a big multiplicative effect going on right now. Because in combination with wanting to pump more volume of water per foot, we're also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically. It's easy to calculate. Some of these wells it's -- would have gone up roughly 1/3, compared to where it was done in the past. And we're already pumping quite a bit of water. So I think the answer is, water's going to be a key. I think we had to identify it, even a couple of years ago, you recall, when we talked about building out, at that time, was a massive water system. In response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it. But there may be a day a reckoning for that as we forward, especially in the scenarios of higher prices. But suffice it to say, we are taking water from the city of Odessa. This is effluent water, as we speak. We still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same. That contract with the city of Midland has us investing capital in their water infrastructure. We are spending money this year on some of our mainline systems, but we would want -- we would want to do further work on our main lines and some of our secondary storage systems. Basically frac ponds, as we move forward. I think we can do it in a relatively piecemeal basis. But as I said, as we're pumping higher volumes, it becomes more problematic in terms of just volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get the course to where we're not using any freshwater. We're making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs, so -- to where we could get there I think in a matter of a couple of years to where we're not using any freshwater. Though we are doing a lot in terms of drilling new saltwater disposal wells in the one hand, but also water, this brackish water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you kept kind of the other side of the coin, which is to say, this water is when it's -- when you start turning the wells on for production, it comes back to you. We're pushing more water down in the system, without a completion of how that water comes back, and you've got to have a place to put it. Rather than overbuilding the facilities at the least, this is tank batteries for saltwater production, which had been generally speaking, designed for lower volumes. Now we've got dramatically higher volumes of water. This is produced water coming back at us. Rather than overbuilding the infrastructure, and in doing so, basically creating a situation where you'd never be able to use the peak capacity. We would rather choke these wells back and in some cases, they have been choked back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we're seeing in some cases as you saw, and today that I showed you, 45 days or to 60 days. And when the water starts coming off a system, then you get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather err on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin."

You look at gas processing facilities, typically in our case, they run $140 million or so. We have 27% interest, so that's not very material, so. I think you'll see us still go about in somewhat of a somewhat piecemeal fashion, considering we're not at a point where we were in 2014. 2014, we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over an 8-year period, I'd say. Today, we're at 12, going to 17 hoping to go to 30 over the next 3 years or so. So we're really not in the same scenario we were in. But nonetheless, we are pumping more volumes, and so there is that effect. But it will be something we have to continually spend money on. But I think we'll still do it more piecemeal. You're not going to see us coming out with a huge, multi $100 million water project any given year."

I think I mentioned that Charles, there is a trade-off that has to do with not overbuilding when you only -- we see this all the time in gas processing, as an example, where you build a gas plant. And if you're not careful, you build it for the capacity that exists one day, and you see producing -- production declines. And you only use the capacity you built out and the extra cost for a minimal amount of time. So there's this trade-off between overcapitalizing a project and/or the need for current production. I think when we're in the range of 30 or 40 or 45 days, in terms of choking the wells back. That's really immaterial, I mean it does postpone our knowledge base for whatever that is, 30 days. But we really need 60 -- or 6 months or so anyway of production days to figure out how these wells are going to do. So we're not that worried about that postponement of 30 days of knowledge.

So that's a systematic approach we're taking. That means, we also need to come back later on, for example, lower Spraberry Shale zones and so on. But in terms of, as you look at the capital requirements of all that, what we do know is when we build tank bays they're for 60 wells, essentially. So the cost efficiency comes, especially on the last, let's just say half of those wells, the first set of the wells will be subject to several million dollars' worth of capital just to put the facilities out there. The last wells are $70,000 to $150,000 capital, because of the fact the facility is already there, and we had to just put in some production equipment. So you actually do see improving returns if you look at simple, identical well metrics, the further you go into the program.

We're building that inventory up as I mentioned, vis a vis trades and other methods, to make sure we can increase the lateral lengths. But as you look forward and you look at what lateral lengths seem to be optimal, our average in the Wolfcamp B, I think this year has now been edging up to about 9,500. I wouldn't be surprised to see that number go up from here, just on the basis of what I just mentioned. However, there's probably a limit at which we would call it a day on horizontal length, probably in the neighborhood of 13,000 feet, maybe a little bit more than that, just based on what amounts to hydraulics. It's -- you have a lot of line losses as you pump volumes down that long of a horizontal pipe. And so you -- the risk you have is not getting off proper fracs, especially at the toe of the wells. And so I think we kind of earned our position having tested this out, that we believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at let's say 13,000. We probably avoid any kind of diminishing terms, all the way out to, let's say 11,000 to 12,000. So when we start seeing diminishing returns, I think is where we sort of call it a day and decide that's what we're going to call it. It's not a technical limit.

He's going to provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2016. It was another great quarter for Pioneer. We saw the company continue to deliver solid execution and outstanding performance. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our latest outlook for Pioneer through the end of this decade and discuss our 2016 capital program and the production forecast through 2020.  Joey will then review our continuing strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency improvements in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp as well as the drilling plans for this asset through the remainder of the year. Rich will then cover the third quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. And of course, as always, after that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott, but not without highlighting that this will be Scott's last earnings call as CEO of Pioneer after leading the company for more than 30 years. I know that I speak for Pioneer's management committee and all of our employees in wishing Scott and his wife, Kim, a very happy and healthy retirement. We'll miss you, Scott. So over to you."

As Frank said, as most of you know, this is my last earnings call after 25 years of being public. I want to extend a special thanks to all shareholders and to all analysts on the call and our great relationship that we've had over the years. 
I'd like to give a brief message before I review the first 2 financial and operating highlights slides.  As a continuing large, long-term shareholder and board member, I have 100% confidence in Tim and the management team that will continue to make this company the premier shale company in the world. We have the best rocks and balance sheet and the best employees in the industry. What company can easily grow 15% per year for 10 years and move up to over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in a $47 to $57 oil price environment? If you look at the Permian only, that growth rate is well over 20% over those 10 years. What company has over 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent with over 20,000 locations and an average net revenue interest of 85% and essentially has 0 basis on those locations, except for the recent Devon transaction, and in an environment where companies are paying $40,000 to $60,000 per acre? In addition, we're growing our oil mix from 57% this year to 62% next year and over 70% over the next 10 years.
With regard to oil prices, we're obviously not out of the woods yet. I give OPEC a 40% chance of reaching agreement on November 30, and they do, everyone will cheat. I have seen this over my 42-year career.  The market will not balance until 2018. That is why Pioneer is best positioned among oil companies with great hedges in place for '17 and the best balance sheet in the industry.
Now we'll go to Slide #3 in financial and operating highlights. We had adjusted income for the quarter of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter production, 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, above Pioneer's guidance range of 232,000 to 237,000, an increase of 6,000 barrels a day or 3% versus second quarter, obviously driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal program and our completion optimization program. We did have an unplanned downtime at Fain gas plant, which affected the quarter by 2,000 barrels a day from West Panhandle production. We did place 46 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp in the third quarter with strong performance, including 28 wells from 3.0 version, again, the 3.0 version significantly outperforming 2.0. did expand our 3.0 from 80 wells to 100 wells. Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, again through completion optimization, longer lateral lengths, enhancing productivity, drilling and completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are continuing to drive down costs  per lateral foot.
On Slide #4, reduced production cost per BOE by 6% since second quarter '16 and 32% since third quarter of 2015. And yes, as some people may question, our horizontal operating Permian costs are $2, excluding taxes. Enhanced Martin County acreage position by closing purchase of 28,000 net acres from Devon for $429 million. With export ban removed last year, we did sell our first 2 Permian oil cargoes for export to Europe in the third quarter. 
We repaid mid-July debt maturity of $455 million with cash on hand. And with the recent run-up, of course obviously 3 or 4 weeks ago, with oil prices, we did increase our '17 derivative coverage to 75% for oil and 55% for gas, up from 50% from last quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to our next CEO, Tim Dove."

As we've been discussing for some time, we're in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs come in November to complete the total addition of 5 rigs.",1287,"Thanks, Scott, and I share Frank's good wishes you going forward. 
As we've been discussing for some time, we're in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs come in November to complete the total addition of 5 rigs. That will put us with 17 rigs in the northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp by year-end. 
Our capital program remains essentially unchanged. It's been that way for some time, as is the Devon transaction was announced for $2.1 billion. The truth is these rigs I mentioned a moment ago will not really have a significant production adds until 2017. However, just the fact that we're improving our productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field area with a horizontal drilling campaign and completions optimization is allowing us to increase our forecast for this year's production from 13% plus to 14% plus. We see now even with the 17-rig count maintained flat, would expect to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% next year. Really what we're fighting of course is as we continue to do more with less as we continue to optimize our program.
The 2017 campaign of drilling is well funded already with our balance sheet on the one hand and, also as Scott had mentioned, our strong position having been built up considerably over the last few weeks and our cash flow assumptions based on strip prices. 
Current 2017 capital budget is far from finalized. There's a lot of discussions of course, going on with our partners and internally as to where we're going to land the budget. But suffice it to say, we currently are looking at numbers that are in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion for 2017. 
One of our more critical messages in this whole presentation is in the yellow box on the bottom of Slide 5. And it's the fact that as Scott had mentioned, we're on a plan here to increase our annual production growth rate to about 15% for several years and in doing so, keeping exceptionally strong balance sheet, in this case, net debt to operating cash flow below 1, even using only strip prices. And in addition, we mentioned we'd grow our production at that 15% rate. Our actual compound annual growth rate of cash flow exceeds that and is approximately 25% and has to do with the drilling projects that are higher-margin oil based in terms of their returns. And one of the major components of this is, and our internal modeling certainly supports the fact, that we can do this while spending within cash flow as early as 2018. And that's assuming about a $55 per barrel oil price case. So this is we're focused on really for the next several years, one of the main components of which is, at minimum, cash flow neutrality which, as I said, I think we can reach 2018.
Turning now to Slide 6, I mentioned a moment ago our capital budget remains essentially unchanged in 2016 at $2.1 billion. The splits as shown on this slide are -- is also essentially the same. Our cash flow number appears to be coming in as we had projected, maybe $1.5 billion. With cash on hand, we easily can fund this $2.1 billion this year. As we look forward, we would say the same thing about 2017.
Turning then to Slide 7 and this is our production growth forecast and history. You can see that essentially, we're right on schedule when it comes to our production growth. new forecast for 2016 being moved up to 14% from 13% as I had mentioned. That gives us approximately a new number of 233,000-plus BOE per day. If you look at quarters, quarter 3 was again lower range. fourth quarter production range we show here is a bit of an estimate only because as has been evidenced by some of our earlier commentary in the material Frank put out last night, we have seen [indiscernible] plant in West Panhandle area. That is in the process of being rectified, but it's unclear how many more days that's going to take before we can get to full production. So what you see here is us being relatively conservative to make sure we can get that plant back in full operation. 
But as you look forward and if you look towards the future growth, we're reflecting on this slide 15% CAGR growth rate through the end of the decade. If you do the math on this, this gets us over 400,000 barrels a day by 2020. And oil growth is of course a considerable component of that. There's been some discussions and questions that are raised by where we came out in terms of our oil content production for the third quarter showing at 56%, where we had 58% in the second quarter. Now this is relatively easily explained by the fact that we put in our target gas plant in the Martin County area, referred to as the Buffalo plan, in April of this year. And of course in doing so, we had to assess and project what sort of NGL recoveries we can get from that plant. It turns out they're substantially better than what we thought. And so we have to go back in that sense in the third quarter and do the accrual adjustment for those additional NGLs. that's a very big positive of our NGL fraction of that plant is significantly higher than what we thought. 
In addition, if you then set it up with the fact that we had substantially higher frac shut-in wells, we had about 5,000 barrels a day shut in if you average for the second quarter. increased to 10,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We're obviously very busy out in the field. We've got more rigs running. We have our own frac fleets running. We don't adjust down in terms of the quarter. And those fleets continue to work, and our shut-in production hours move up and down every week. But suffice it to say on average, much higher shut-in production in the second quarter. And that's a good thing because that means we're actively working on new wells. 
The final thing I'd say in that regard is that our new wells to continue to show initial production percentages of about 80% for oil. And that's a good thing. The GORs do increase slightly through the course of the life of the wells. But suffice it to say, we're still seeing IPs of 80% oil. So that is all going well. And I would also follow by saying that there are some discussions around the our oil growth, it was substantially higher than the second quarter than the third. And that has to do with a couple of factors. One is our numbers were substantially higher in the second quarter. About 69 wells were put on production, where in the third quarter as scheduled, we only had a lesser number in this case. We had 46 wells. By definition, oil growth rate would be a little bit less in that scenario. 
And then in addition of which, the same effect occurs vis-à-vis shutting in of offset frac wells. That is about a 5,000 barrel a day increase in the wells that are shut in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
But all in all, I guess the message is that we're right on schedule on this forecast. And I think it bodes well for our ability to keep running the factory and keep moving forward with a higher level of activity. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joey, who is our EVP of Permian operations."

I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the south",950,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the southern JV area, with 4 more wells added in the North and one in the South. We also continue to see a positive balance for our Version 3.0 completions when compared to 2.0 in the North with 3 additional months of production data and 15 more wells. 
Same story with Version 3.0 completions in the South with 5 additional wells added in Q3. And as we mentioned last quarter, the early results of the new POPs work were masked somewhat due to choking, but we're now starting to see some good separation for our 3.0 completions.
Moving to Slide #9, similar to the previous slide, we continue to see the improved performance from our Wolfcamp B wells in both the North and the South. In the North, Wolfcamp the Version 2.0 still showing a 25% productivity improvement, with 2 additional wells added to the mix. Wolfcamp A Version 3.0 wells in the North are also showing a performance improvement over 2.0 with 3 more months of production data and 8 new wells. There were no new 2.0 or 3.0 wells added in the southern JV area in Q3. And of course, the same caveats apply on early choking of the new wells.
Moving to Slide 10, same story on Lower Spraberry Shale wells for our Version 2.0 completions, which are still tracking 10% above the 1 million a day type curve with 10 new wells added. Just reiterating the messages from our recent well performance, 2.0 completions continue their strong performance in all intervals with no retraction on our performance as stated in the past. And early favorable returns on our 3.0 completions led us to expand our optimization program from 80 to 100 wells. And we will continue to use choke management going forward to optimize utilize the use of our existing water disposal infrastructures. some of early results may somewhat be held back, but long-term performance is looking very good.
Moving to Slide 11, D&C costs have continued their downward trend, even though our completion sizes have increased materially with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions, which can add between $500,000 to $1.5 million to the cost of a well. For perspective, I recently compared this quarter to Q3 of 2015. And we're replacing on average 25% more sand and 50% more water per well and drilling longer laterals for $145 less per foot than we were iabout Q3 of last year. I'd also like to emphasize the range of well costs in the upper right corner which shows Lower Spraberry Shale wells averaging $670 per foot and also highlighted we delivered Wolfcamp A wells for an average of $5.8 million. 
The bigger graph of course, only reflects Wolfcamp B wells, which also includes a growing population of what we refer to as lower Wolfcamp B wells, which are typically slower drilling than the upper B targets. Bottom line, when coupled with the improved well performance, our capital efficiency continues to improve.
Moving to Slide 12. This is a new slide, so I'll spend a little time explaining it. The data comes from IHS, and it captures new wells with at least 3 months of production data between September of 2015 and June of 2016. It's important to point out that the data is not normalized for lateral length, which will be an important point here in a moment. And the y-axis illustrates the number of new wells with at least 3 months of production, with the first production date after September of 2016. The x-axis is the average cumulative oil produced per well over a 3-month period. So whenever you look at this, some key takeaways, no surprise, the scale of activity is significantly above that of our peers in the Midland Basin, with Pioneer putting on nearly twice as many wells as our nearest competitor. So the next question is, at this high activity level, is there any dilution of inventory? However, in this case, you can see Pioneer is consistently delivering strong wells, which highlights the quality of our acreage position.
The fact that the data is not normalized further highlights that lateral length is important because it illustrates the contiguous nature of our acreage and our ability to consistently drill longer laterals. And then lastly, it demonstrates that our completion and optimization efforts continue to be successful.
Moving to Slide 13. Just a few highlights here, some of which have already been covered. we're in the process of increasing to 15 rigs in the near-term and will be at 17 rigs by year-end. We remain on target to put 230 horizontal wells on line with a mix of wells shown there. Version 2.0 completions remain the standard with another 20 wells moved to Version 3.0 from the original 80. And we're now forecasting 50% to 65% IRRs with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions in late October strip pricing.
Moving to Slide 14 and my last slide. Production growth remains strong, with production up to 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3. we're planning to put 60 new wells online in Q4, which will be weighted mostly late in the quarter, with production between 185,000 to 190,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. This raises our year-end outlook in the Permian to 170,000-plus barrels of oil equivalent per day and 36% production and 38% oil growth over 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rich for the financial highlights."
295224,380579891,1070149,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This",705,"Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This is due to prices at the end of September being higher than those at the end of June 30 for those derivatives that are yet to price in the future. 
Also included in the quarter was an unusual item related to the deferred tax benefit because we're recognizing a tax credit on R&D work for horizontal drilling wells innovations that we've had from 2012 to 2015. So that was also $59 million going the other way or $0.35. So adjusted for mark-to-market derivatives and usual items, we were still at $22 million of income or $0.13.
Looking at the middle of the page, where you can see how we came in relative to guidance. You can see it by looking down that list that we came in better than expected or within guidance on all the items listed there, so another really strong quarter for the company.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. If you look at the bar charts there, you can see that oil was -- quarter-on-quarter was flat, with our realized prices being around $41.40 a barrel. If you look at NGLs, we were down 12%. That's mainly due to lower propane and ethane prices during the quarter. And then gas, if you look at the red bars there, was up 46% just due to supply and demand fundamental changes that we've seen over the last few months. 
If you look at the bottom part of this slide, on derivatives, you can see that the company continues to benefit from our strong derivative position. During the quarter, we recognized $184 million of incremental cash flow. That brings us to $533 million for the year through 9 months.
Turning to Slide 17, looking at production costs. You can see here by looking at the chart that we continue to trend lower. We're down 6%, as Scott mentioned, quarter-on-quarter, and it's mainly driven by our cost-reduction initiatives and mainly on costs on repair costs, maintenance costs, chemical costs, those are all down significantly over the time period shown here. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. They're benefiting from the new Spraberry/Wolfcamp wells that we're drilling that Scott talked about at $2 operating cost before taxes and $4 all in.
Turning to Slide 18. This is -- in the second quarter we've shown our cash margins by asset. And once again, it just highlights the cash margins that are being generated in our Permian horizontal wells, just under $30 for this quarter, 70% on oil for the reasons that Tim talked about. So really, just highlights why we continue to invest over 90% of our capital budget into the Permian drilling, and just given the high rate of return, these projects generated 50% to 65%.
Turning to Slide 19, our liquidity position. Excellent liquidity position with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million, undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, so terrific financial position. If you look at the maturity chart there, it is worth noting that the March 2017 bond maturity has already been pre- funded. We plan to pay that with cash on hand in March of next year.
Turning to Slide 20, looking at our fourth quarter outlook. Production guidance is 237,000 to 242,000 BOEs a day, really reflecting the downtime at West Panhandle. So that's 2,000 to 5,000 barrels a day lower than we probably normally would have been, and then obviously reflects our legacy assets that we're are not investing capital in today and their decline. 
The other item that is a change is production costs. You can see that $7.75 per BOE to $9.75 per BOE, really reflecting our lower run rate. And the rest of the items here are all consistent with our third quarter results and prior quarter guidance. I'm not going to go through those individually, but they're there for your review and modeling purposes. 
So with that, Anna, I think we'll open the call for questions."

So I guess we're going to want at least 9 months of data before we declare victory and really go all out to do our forecasting on that basis. But as Joey said, our confidence level is pretty high. I mean, we've increased from 80 wells to 100 wells this year.

I mean, to the extent we have more rigs running more wells getting completed, this type of shut-in data in the background becomes less and less discernible. It's -- right now we're in a situation where in the third quarter, as I mentioned, we had 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That is highly visible when you look at the numbers. I expect though with our activity levels increasing, for example in the fourth quarter, we're are also estimating about 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That's in our forecast. But as you go forward, I think there'll be a percentage of shut-in wells that correspond to the activity level. And the other way to look at it is, as you know, because we've talked about this from time to time, part of this year's campaign and certainly part of next year's drilling campaign and completion campaign will have us coming back to areas where we've already drilled and completed B wells and drilling the A wells that correspond to those B wells. So what that means is, to be safe, we need to go ahead and shut in the associated B wells. So that's a natural fact as we go through an A campaign, we're shutting in B wells. And so it's really a mix of things, but suffice it to say, shut-in wells should be essentially linear with activity levels."

One of the things that we do anytime we have a design change of this significance, and particularly with the fact that we're doing so much choking, is we're heavy user of downhole gauges. If you don't have the downhole gauges, you're pacing everything based on a calculation that has a lot of uncertainty in it. So we do put downhole gauges anytime we have a change like this. And what I can tell you is that the data that we see from that is very optimistic. And it helps us build that we understand that the downside of the choking and the upside of the on choked production. The other part of it that's been emphasized a couple of times that I think is the most important indication is the reality of adoption. My -- what I've discovered is that typically, good news stays good news over the entire life of the well. And then sometimes, news that may seem uncertain works itself out over in time and becomes good news. So areas where we start to see news on the early parts of the well, that leads us to have adoption as opposed to wait to do something different. So for me, the latter part tells us that the technical work's been done, and we've made a decision to adopt and go forward."

The answer is it includes running 17 rigs all year. The thing that you're probably thinking about us if you have the sense that maybe that number is a little high is remember that we're drilling more wells now, maybe 15, 16 wells a year with the same number of rigs, and we're are completing those. Our completion cost, while overall they've been coming down, if we go to all 3.0 wells next year, that would have a tendency to skew that number. On infrastructure with more activity, we'll probably be spending at least the same, if not more, on tank batteries. We do have a new target plant that we will have a 27% interest in to pay next year. But probably if you look at our other spending, this year, I think we spent something like $150 million. And if you remember what we've talked about our forecast going forward in this model that Rich and his guys have put together, we've been spending about $300 million for vertical integration water, those type of expenditures. Next year, I would anticipate with our water build out because we can now use you saw on Joey's slide, we're the leader in number of wells we're drilling and putting on production. we're going to need to hell a lot of water with these fracs. So we're going to extend the scope of our mainline from the south and to the North. We will likely start up the Midland project next year to take water from the city of Midland. So I would not be surprised to see that other infrastructure or other capital number at least double and probably go a little bit higher than that next year. Again, those numbers are in flux. So we're giving you a $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion kind of primary number. But based on early work we've done, that's probably within the area that we think we're going to spend."

It's hard to find inventory out there that's as good as what we own and inventory that will then have effect of high grading our own inventory. That said, we think when we do a transaction like the Devon transaction, we should also carve some assets off the bottom of our portfolio.

And we're right in the process of work on that. In addition, I think it will be later this year, or perhaps will extend into next year, a 20,000-acre or so package in Northeast Martin County. And it's possible we would have one package in addition. So we'll see how those things go, but our whole objective here is to be able to say that a transaction like Devon is that net net when the smoke clears, very accretive to our portfolio."

So I think you'll reach some sort of asymptote [ph] before too long. Probably the low 2s. As it relates to inflation, production cost is probably the one area where we have risks of inflation. because the majority of production costs are things like personnel, chemicals, power, all of which are very difficult for us to hedge in any significant way. So if we have risk of inflation, that's probably where it is. I think if you look at the state of Texas, power costs are extremely low. We benefit from wind power here substantially because of that. we've got chemical contracts. I think the labor work force probably be needing some bumps [indiscernible] to composition just to get more workers back in the basin. But I think we can control a lot of that, and I don't really see any substantial risks of any really serious blowout when it comes to inflation hurting our production costs."

I think that one thing will benefit from is we had a slew of rigs that we're now bringing out of stack. We will have essentially no stack rig cost for most of 2017. And several of those rigs, at least half of those rigs come off the existing contracts that were, at the time of their signing, at something like $26,000 a day. we'll re-sign those at whatever than the then current market is. Today, it's maybe 14 or so. so we can see a savings that comes from that. I think we'll continue to nickel and dime a way of these costs. But you're right, to the extent we mix in more 3.0s, we could see these, but number's sort of bottoming out. As to the inflation effects here, here, I think we're very well protected. We can argue about when service companies are going to have pricing power, the fact is we're doing our own completions. we have 5 fleets running today. We know what the costs of those are. So we're not going to be subject the cost increases on completions which is as you know, by far the biggest parts of the wells. And in fact, we may have reductions in drilling cost, as I mentioned. So I think overall, we're well protected from any kind of inflationary issues when it comes to our capital program. I think that will continue through 2017. And for my money, I don't think the service companies will have a lot of pricing power until we get well into '18, and that's predicated at higher prices."

As Frank said, as most of you know, this is my last earnings call after 25 years of being public. I want to extend a special thanks to all shareholders and to all analysts on the call and our great relationship that we've had over the years. 
I'd like to give a brief message before I review the first 2 financial and operating highlights slides.  As a continuing large, long-term shareholder and board member, I have 100% confidence in Tim and the management team that will continue to make this company the premier shale company in the world. We have the best rocks and balance sheet and the best employees in the industry. What company can easily grow 15% per year for 10 years and move up to over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in a $47 to $57 oil price environment? If you look at the Permian only, that growth rate is well over 20% over those 10 years. What company has over 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent with over 20,000 locations and an average net revenue interest of 85% and essentially has 0 basis on those locations, except for the recent Devon transaction, and in an environment where companies are paying $40,000 to $60,000 per acre? In addition, we're growing our oil mix from 57% this year to 62% next year and over 70% over the next 10 years.
With regard to oil prices, we're obviously not out of the woods yet. I give OPEC a 40% chance of reaching agreement on November 30, and they do, everyone will cheat. I have seen this over my 42-year career.  The market will not balance until 2018. That is why Pioneer is best positioned among oil companies with great hedges in place for '17 and the best balance sheet in the industry.
Now we'll go to Slide #3 in financial and operating highlights. We had adjusted income for the quarter of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter production, 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, above Pioneer's guidance range of 232,000 to 237,000, an increase of 6,000 barrels a day or 3% versus second quarter, obviously driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal program and our completion optimization program. We did have an unplanned downtime at Fain gas plant, which affected the quarter by 2,000 barrels a day from West Panhandle production. We did place 46 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp in the third quarter with strong performance, including 28 wells from 3.0 version, again, the 3.0 version significantly outperforming 2.0. We did expand our 3.0 from 80 wells to 100 wells. Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, again through completion optimization, longer lateral lengths, enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are continuing to drive down cost per lateral foot.
On Slide #4, reduced production cost per BOE by 6% since second quarter of '16 and 32% since third quarter of 2015. And yes, as some people may question, our horizontal Permian operating costs are $2, excluding taxes. Enhanced Martin County acreage position by closing purchase of 28,000 net acres from Devon for $429 million. With the export ban removed last year, we did sell our first 2 Permian oil cargoes for export to Europe in the third quarter. 
We repaid mid-July debt maturity of $455 million with cash on hand. And with the recent run-up, of course, obviously 3 or 4 weeks ago, with oil prices, we did increase our '17 derivative coverage to 75% for oil and 55% for gas, up from 50% from last quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to our next CEO, Tim Dove."

As we've been discussing for some time, we are in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition of 5 rigs. That will put us with 17 rigs in the northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp area by year-end. 
Our capital program remains essentially unchanged. It's been that way for some time, as is the Devon transaction was announced for $2.1 billion. The truth that these rigs that I mentioned a moment ago will not really have a significant production adds until 2017, however, just the fact that we're improving our productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field area with a horizontal drilling campaign and completions optimization is allowing us to actually increase our forecast for this year's production from 13% plus to 14% plus. We see now, even with the 17-rig count maintained flat, that we would expect to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% next year. Really, what we're finding of course is we can continue to do more with less as we continue to optimize our program.
The 2017 campaign of drilling is well funded already with our balance sheet on the one hand and also, as Scott had mentioned, our strong derivatives position having been built up considerably over the last few weeks and our cash flow assumptions based on strip prices. 
Current 2017 capital budget is far from finalized. There's a lot of discussions, of course, that are ongoing with our partners and internally as to where we're going to land the budget. But suffice it to say, we currently are looking at numbers that are in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion for 2017. 
One of our more critical messages in this whole presentation is in the yellow box at the bottom of Slide 5. And it's the fact that, as Scott had mentioned, we are on a plan here to increase our annual production growth rate to about 15% for several years and in doing so, keeping exceptionally strong balance sheet, in this case, net debt to operating cash flow below 1, even using only strip prices. And in addition, we mentioned we'd grow our production at that 15% rate, our actual compound annual growth rate of cash flow exceeds that and is approximately 25%. That has to do with drilling projects that are higher-margin oil based in terms of their returns. And one of the major components of this is, and our internal modeling certainly supports the fact that we can do this while spending within cash flow as early as 2018, and that's assuming about a $55 per barrel oil price case. So this is what we are focused on, really, for the next several years. One of the main components of which is, at minimum, cash flow neutrality, which, as I said, I think we can reach 2018.
Turning now to Slide 6. I mentioned a moment ago our capital budget remains essentially unchanged in 2016 at $2.1 billion. The splits, as shown on this slide, are -- is also essentially the same. Our cash flow number appears to be coming in as we had projected, maybe $1.5 billion. With cash on hand, we easily can fund this $2.1 billion this year. As we look forward, we would say the same thing about 2017.
Turning then to Slide 7, and this is our production growth forecast and history. You could see that essentially, we're right on schedule when it comes to our production growth. The new forecast for 2016 being moved up to 14% from 13%, as I had mentioned. That gives us approximately a new number of 233,000-plus BOE per day. But if you look at the quarters, our quarter 3 was again substantially above our range. The fourth quarter production range we show here is a bit of an estimate only because, as has been evidenced by some of our earlier commentary and the material Frank put out last night, we have an upset [ph] at our Fain plant in West Panhandle field area. That is in the process of being rectified, but it's unclear how many more days that's going to take before we can get to full production. So what you see here is us being relatively conservative to make sure that we can get that plant back and in full operation. 
But as you look forward and if you look towards the future growth, we are reflecting on this slide a 15% CAGR growth rate through the end of the decade. If you do the math on this, this gets us over 400,000 barrels a day by 2020. And oil growth is, of course, a considerable component of that. 
There's been some discussions and questions that are raised by where we came out in terms of our oil content production for the third quarter showing at 56%, where we had 58% in the second quarter. Now this is relatively easily explained by the fact that we put in our target of gas plant in the Martin County area, referred to as the Buffalo plant, in April of this year. And of course, in doing so, we had to assess and project what sort of NGL recoveries we can get from that plant. It turns out they're substantially better than what we thought. And so we have to go back, in that sense, in the third quarter and do the accrual adjustment for those additional NGLs. So it's a very big positive and our NGL fraction of that plant is significantly higher than what we thought. 
In addition, if you then match it up with the fact that we had really substantially higher offset frac shut-in wells, we had about 5,000 barrels a day shut in, if you average for the second quarter. That increased to 10,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We're obviously very busy out in the field. We've got more rigs running. We have our own frac fleets running. We don't adjust down in terms of the quarter. And those frac fleets continue to work, and our shut-in production hours move up and down every week. But suffice it to say, on average, much higher shut-in production in the second quarter, and that's a good thing because that means we're actively working on new wells. 
The final thing I'd say in that regard is that our new wells do continue to show initial production percentages of about 80% for oil. And that's a good thing. The GORs do increase slightly through the course of the life of the wells. But suffice it to say, we're still seeing IPs of 80% oil. So that is all going seemingly well. And I would also follow up by saying that there are some discussions surrounding our oil growth. It was substantially higher in the second quarter than the third. And that has to do with a couple of factors. One is our POP numbers were substantially higher in the second quarter. About 69 wells were put on production, where in the third quarter as scheduled, we only had a lesser number, in this case, we POP 46 wells. By definition, your oil growth rate would be a little bit less in that scenario. And then in addition of which, the same effect occurs vis-à-vis the shutting in of offset frac wells. That is about a 5,000 barrel a day increase in the wells that are shut in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
But all in all, I guess the message is that our -- we are right on schedule on this forecast. And I think it bodes well for our ability to keep running the factory and keep moving forward with you in a higher level of activity. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joey Hall, who's our EVP of Permian operations."

I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the South",954,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the Southern JV area, with 4 more wells added in the North and one in the South. We also continue to see a positive balance for our Version 3.0 completions when compared to 2.0 in the North, with 3 additional months of production data and 15 more wells. 
Same story with Version 3.0 completions in the South, with 5 additional wells added in Q3. And as we mentioned last quarter, the early results of the new POPs were masked somewhat due to choking, but we're now starting to see some good separation for our 3.0 completions.
Moving to Slide #9. Similar to the previous slide, we continue to see the improved performance from our Wolfcamp A wells in both the North and the South. In the North, Wolfcamp A Version 2.0, still showing a 25% productivity improvement, with 2 additional wells added to the mix. Wolfcamp A Version 3.0 wells in the North are also showing a performance improvement over 2.0, with 3 more months of production data and 8 new wells. There were no new 2.0 or 3.0 wells added in the Southern JV area in Q3. And of course, the same caveats apply on early choking of the new wells.
Moving to Slide 10, same story on Lower Spraberry Shale wells for our Version 2.0 completions, which are still tracking 10% above the 1 million a day type curve, with 10 new wells added. Just reiterating the messages from our recent well performance, 2.0 completions continue their strong performance in all intervals, with no retraction on our performance, as has been stated in the past. And early favorable returns on our 3.0 completions has led us to expand our optimization program from 80 to 100 wells. And we will continue to use choke management going forward to optimize utilize the utilization of our water disposal infrastructures. So some of the early results may be somewhat held back, but long-term performance is looking very good.
Moving to Slide 11, D&C costs have continued their downward trend, even though our completion sizes have increased materially with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions, which can add between $500,000 to $1.5 million to the cost of a well. For perspective, I recently compared this quarter to Q3 of 2015. And we're replacing on average 25% more sand and 50% more water per well and drilling longer laterals for $145 less per foot than we were that Q3 of last year. 
I'd also like to emphasize the range of well costs in the upper right corner, which shows Lower Spraberry Shale wells averaging $670 per foot and also highlight that we delivered Wolfcamp A wells for an average of $5.8 million. 
The bigger graph, of course, only reflects Wolfcamp B wells, which also includes a growing population of what we refer to as lower Wolfcamp B wells, which are typically slower drilling than the upper B targets. Bottom line, when coupled with the improved well performance, our capital efficiency continues to improve.
Moving to Slide 12. This is a new slide, so I'll spend a little time explaining it. The data comes from IHS, and it captures new wells with at least 3 months of production data between September of 2015 and June of 2016. It's important to point out that the data is not normalized for lateral length, which will be an important point here in a moment. And the y-axis illustrates the number of new wells with at least 3 months of production, with the first production date after September of 2016. The x-axis is the average cumulative oil produced per well over a 3-month period. So whenever you look at this, some key takeaways, no surprise, the scale of activity is significantly above that of our peers in the Midland Basin, with Pioneer putting on nearly twice as many wells as our nearest competitor. So the next question is, at this high activity level, is there any dilution of inventory? However, in this case, you can see Pioneer is consistently delivering strong wells, which highlights the quality of our acreage position.
The fact that the data is not normalized further highlights that lateral length is important because it illustrates the contiguous nature of our acreage and our ability to consistently drill longer laterals. And then lastly, it demonstrates that our completion and optimization efforts continue to be successful.
Moving to Slide 13. Just a few highlights here, some of which have already been covered. we're in the process of increasing to 15 rigs in the near-term and will be at 17 rigs by year-end. We remain on target to put 230 horizontal wells on line with a mix of wells shown there. Version 2.0 completions remain the standard with another 20 wells moved to Version 3.0 from the original 80. And we're now forecasting 50% to 65% IRRs with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions in late October strip pricing.
Moving to Slide 14 and my last slide. Production growth remains strong, with production up to 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3. we're planning to put 60 new wells online in Q4, which will be weighted mostly late in the quarter, with production between 185,000 to 190,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. This raises our year-end outlook in the Permian to 170,000-plus barrels of oil equivalent per day and 36% production and 38% oil growth over 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rich for the financial highlights."
295224,380579891,1070195,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This",705,"Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This is due to prices at the end of September being higher than those at the end of June 30 for those derivatives that are yet to price in the future. 
Also included in the quarter was an unusual item related to the deferred tax benefit because we're recognizing a tax credit on R&D work for horizontal drilling wells innovations that we've had from 2012 to 2015. So that was also $59 million going the other way or $0.35. So adjusted for mark-to-market derivatives and usual items, we were still at $22 million of income or $0.13.
Looking at the middle of the page, where you can see how we came in relative to guidance. You can see it by looking down that list that we came in better than expected or within guidance on all the items listed there, so another really strong quarter for the company.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. If you look at the bar charts there, you can see that oil was -- quarter-on-quarter was flat, with our realized prices being around $41.40 a barrel. If you look at NGLs, we were down 12%. That's mainly due to lower propane and ethane prices during the quarter. And then gas, if you look at the red bars there, was up 46% just due to supply and demand fundamental changes that we've seen over the last few months. 
If you look at the bottom part of this slide, on derivatives, you can see that the company continues to benefit from our strong derivative position. During the quarter, we recognized $184 million of incremental cash flow. That brings us to $533 million for the year through 9 months.
Turning to Slide 17, looking at production costs. You can see here by looking at the chart that we continue to trend lower. We're down 6%, as Scott mentioned, quarter-on-quarter, and it's mainly driven by our cost-reduction initiatives and mainly on costs on repair costs, maintenance costs, chemical costs, those are all down significantly over the time period shown here. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. They're benefiting from the new Spraberry/Wolfcamp wells that we're drilling that Scott talked about at $2 operating cost before taxes and $4 all in.
Turning to Slide 18. This is -- in the second quarter we've shown our cash margins by asset. And once again, it just highlights the cash margins that are being generated in our Permian horizontal wells, just under $30 for this quarter, 70% on oil for the reasons that Tim talked about. So really, just highlights why we continue to invest over 90% of our capital budget into the Permian drilling, and just given the high rate of return, these projects generated 50% to 65%.
Turning to Slide 19, our liquidity position. Excellent liquidity position with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million, undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, so terrific financial position. If you look at the maturity chart there, it is worth noting that the March 2017 bond maturity has already been pre- funded. We plan to pay that with cash on hand in March of next year.
Turning to Slide 20, looking at our fourth quarter outlook. Production guidance is 237,000 to 242,000 BOEs a day, really reflecting the downtime at West Panhandle. So that's 2,000 to 5,000 barrels a day lower than we probably normally would have been, and then obviously reflects our legacy assets that we're are not investing capital in today and their decline. 
The other item that is a change is production costs. You can see that $7.75 per BOE to $9.75 per BOE, really reflecting our lower run rate. And the rest of the items here are all consistent with our third quarter results and prior quarter guidance. I'm not going to go through those individually, but they're there for your review and modeling purposes. 
So with that, Anna, I think we'll open the call for questions."

It's -- right now we're in a situation where in the third quarter, as I mentioned, we had 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That is highly visible when you look at the numbers. I expect though with our activity levels increasing, for example in the fourth quarter, we're are also estimating about 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That's in our forecast. But as you go forward, I think there'll be a percentage of shut-in wells that correspond to the activity level. And the other way to look at it is, as you know, because we've talked about this from time to time, part of this year's campaign and certainly part of next year's drilling campaign and completion campaign will have us coming back to areas where we've already drilled and completed B wells and drilling the A wells that correspond to those B wells. So what that means is, to be safe, we need to go ahead and shut in the associated B wells. So that's a natural fact as we go through an A campaign, we're shutting in B wells. And so it's really a mix of things, but suffice it to say, shut-in wells should be essentially linear with activity levels."

One of the things that we do anytime we have a design change of this significance, and particularly with the fact that we're doing so much choking, is we're a heavy user of downhole gauges. If you don't have the downhole gauges, you're pacing everything based on a calculation that has a lot of uncertainty in it. So we do put downhole gauges anytime we have a change like this. And what I can tell you is that the data that we see from that is very optimistic. And it helps us build that we understand that the downside of the choking and the upside of the unchoked production. The other part of it that's been emphasized a couple of times that I think is the most important indication is the reality of adoption. My -- what I've discovered is that typically, good news stays good news over the entire life of the well. And then sometimes, news that may seem uncertain works itself out over in time and becomes good news. So the areas where we start to see news on the early parts of the well, that leads us to have early adoption as opposed to wait to do something different. So for me, the latter part tells us that the technical work's been done, and we've made a decision to adopt and go forward."

The answer is it includes running 17 rigs all year. The thing that you're probably thinking about is, if you have a sense that maybe that number is a little high, is remember that we are drilling more wells now, maybe 15, 16 wells a year with the same number of rigs, and we're completing those. Our completion cost, while overall, they've been coming down, if we go to all 3.0 wells next year, that would have a tendency to skew that number up. On infrastructure, with more activity, we'll probably be spending at least the same, if not more, on tank batteries. We do have a new target plant that we will have a 27% interest in to pay next year. But probably, if you look at our other spending, this year, I think we spent something like $150 million. And if you remember when we've talked about our forecast going forward in this model that Rich and his guys have put together, we've been spending about $300 million for vertical integration, water, those type of expenditures. Next year, I would anticipate with our water buildout, because we can now use -- you saw on Joey's slide, we're the league leader in a number of wells that we're drilling and putting on production, we're going to need a hell lot of water with these bigger fracs. So we're going to extend the scope of our mainline from the South and to the North. We will likely start up the Midland project next year to take water from the city of Midland. So I would not be surprised to see that other infrastructure or other capital number at least double and probably go a little bit higher than that next year. Again, those numbers are in flux. So we're giving you a $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. It's kind of primary number. But based on the early work we've done, that's probably within the area that we think we're going to spend."

It's hard to find inventory out there that's as good as what we own and the inventory that will then have the effect of high grading our own inventory. That said, we think when we do a transaction like the Devon transaction, we should also carve some assets off the bottom of our portfolio. And toward that end, we have 3 individual efforts underway, one of which is in full gate right now. This is the sale of some acreage in Andrews County. It's about 6,000 -- or 7,000 net acres.

So over the last -- actually, since the export ban, which Scott was so instrumental in bringing to fruition, what's happened is you had a situation which you'd expect, which is really the 2 crudes and differing only by their transportation differentials. And that means there's not a lot of use in terms of exporting. Now we have made many exporting, but it's not significant to the overall value of the barrel. However, moving it out of the United States when we're in a relatively high inventory situation, I think, net-net, it makes sense, especially if we can add to margin to the value of those barrels. So you'll continue to see us looking at those opportunities as one of many opportunities for the final disposition of our sales. And that will be probably true for the rest of industry. The rest of the industry is up, but I think our total export has sort of been exceeding 500,000 barrels a day, including Canada. And that could increase through time.

I think the way that I would consider that, Brian, is that as we continue to increase activity levels, by definition, we keep a ceiling on this production cost number, that is to the extent of other older walls are declining, their operating costs per BOE goes up by definition. We match it up with more new wells with higher volumes that tend to supersede those declines. So I think you'll reach some sort of asymptote here before too long, where that's going to be the case, and it's probably in the low 2s. As it relates to inflation, production cost is probably the one area where we have risks of inflation. It's because the majority of production costs are things like personnel, chemicals, power, all of which are very difficult for us to hedge in any significant way. So if we have any risk of inflation, that's probably where it is. Now I think if you look at the state of Texas, power costs are extremely low. We benefit from wind power here substantially because of that. We've got great chemical contracts. I think the labor workforce will probably be needing some bumps on this to compensation just to get more workers back in the basin. But I think we can control a lot of that, and I don't really see any substantial risks of any really serious blowout when it comes to inflation hurting our production costs."

I think that one thing we'll benefit from is we had still rigs that are -- that we are now bringing out of stack. We'll have essentially no stack rig costs for most of 2017. And several of those rigs, at least half of those rigs will come off the existing contracts that were, at the time of their signing, at something like $26,000 a day. We'll re-sign those at whatever the then current market is. Today, it's maybe 14 or so. And so we can see savings that comes from that. I think we'll continue to nickel and dime our way at these costs. But you're right, to the extent we mix in more 3.0s, we could see these, that the numbers sort of bottoming out. As to the inflation effects here, here, I think we're very well protected. We can argue all day long about when service companies are going to have pricing power, but the fact is we're doing our own completions. We have 5 fleets running today. We know what the costs of those are. So we're not going to be subject to cost increases on completions, which is, as you know, by far the biggest costs of the wells. And in fact, we may have reductions in drilling cost, as I mentioned. So I think overall, we are well protected from any kind of inflationary issues when it comes to our capital program. And I think that will continue through 2017. And for my money, I don't think the service companies will have a lot of pricing power until we get well into '18, and that's predicated on higher prices."

As Frank said, as most of you know, this is my last earnings call after 25 years of being public. I want to extend a special thanks to all shareholders and to all analysts on the call and our great relationship that we've had over the years. 
I'd like to give a brief message before I review the first 2 financial and operating highlights slides.  As a continuing large, long-term shareholder and board member, I have 100% confidence in Tim and the management team that will continue to make this company the premier shale company in the world. We have the best rocks and balance sheet and the best employees in the industry. What company can easily grow 15% per year for 10 years and move up to over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in a $47 to $57 oil price environment? If you look at the Permian only, that growth rate is well over 20% over those 10 years. What company has over 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent with over 20,000 locations and an average net revenue interest of 85% and essentially has 0 basis on those locations, except for the recent Devon transaction, and in an environment where companies are paying $40,000 to $60,000 per acre? In addition, we're growing our oil mix from 57% this year to 62% next year and over 70% over the next 10 years.
With regard to oil prices, we're obviously not out of the woods yet. I give OPEC a 40% chance of reaching agreement on November 30, and they do, everyone will cheat. I have seen this over my 42-year career.  The market will not balance until 2018. That is why Pioneer is best positioned among oil companies with great hedges in place for '17 and the best balance sheet in the industry.
Now we'll go to Slide #3 in financial and operating highlights. We had adjusted income for the quarter of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter production, 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, above Pioneer's guidance range of 232,000 to 237,000, an increase of 6,000 barrels a day or 3% versus second quarter, obviously driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal program and our completion optimization program. We did have an unplanned downtime at Fain gas plant, which affected the quarter by 2,000 barrels a day from West Panhandle production. We did place 46 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp in the third quarter with strong performance, including 28 wells from 3.0 version, again, the 3.0 version significantly outperforming 2.0. We did expand our 3.0 from 80 wells to 100 wells. Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, again through completion optimization, longer lateral lengths, enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are continuing to drive down cost per lateral foot.
On Slide #4, reduced production cost per BOE by 6% since second quarter of '16 and 32% since third quarter of 2015. And yes, as some people may question, our horizontal Permian operating costs are $2, excluding taxes. Enhanced Martin County acreage position by closing purchase of 28,000 net acres from Devon for $429 million. With the export ban removed last year, we did sell our first 2 Permian oil cargoes for export to Europe in the third quarter. 
We repaid mid-July debt maturity of $455 million with cash on hand. And with the recent run-up, of course, obviously 3 or 4 weeks ago, with oil prices, we did increase our '17 derivative coverage to 75% for oil and 55% for gas, up from 50% from last quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to our next CEO, Tim Dove."

I share Frank's good wishes you going forward. As we've been discussing for some time, we are in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition",1330,"Thanks, Scott. I share Frank's good wishes you going forward. 
As we've been discussing for some time, we are in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition of 5 rigs. That will put us with 17 rigs in the northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp area by year-end. 
Our capital program remains essentially unchanged. It's been that way for some time, as is the Devon transaction was announced for $2.1 billion. The truth that these rigs that I mentioned a moment ago will not really have a significant production adds until 2017, however, just the fact that we're improving our productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field area with a horizontal drilling campaign and completions optimization is allowing us to actually increase our forecast for this year's production from 13% plus to 14% plus. We see now, even with the 17-rig count maintained flat, that we would expect to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% next year. Really, what we're finding of course is we can continue to do more with less as we continue to optimize our program.
The 2017 campaign of drilling is well funded already with our balance sheet on the one hand and also, as Scott had mentioned, our strong derivatives position having been built up considerably over the last few weeks and our cash flow assumptions based on strip prices. 
Current 2017 capital budget is far from finalized. There's a lot of discussions, of course, that are ongoing with our partners and internally as to where we're going to land the budget. But suffice it to say, we currently are looking at numbers that are in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion for 2017. 
One of our more critical messages in this whole presentation is in the yellow box at the bottom of Slide 5. And it's the fact that, as Scott had mentioned, we are on a plan here to increase our annual production growth rate to about 15% for several years and in doing so, keeping exceptionally strong balance sheet, in this case, net debt to operating cash flow below 1, even using only strip prices. And in addition, we mentioned we'd grow our production at that 15% rate, our actual compound annual growth rate of cash flow exceeds that and is approximately 25%. That has to do with drilling projects that are higher-margin oil based in terms of their returns. And one of the major components of this is, and our internal modeling certainly supports the fact that we can do this while spending within cash flow as early as 2018, and that's assuming about a $55 per barrel oil price case. So this is what we are focused on, really, for the next several years. One of the main components of which is, at minimum, cash flow neutrality, which, as I said, I think we can reach 2018.
Turning now to Slide 6. I mentioned a moment ago our capital budget remains essentially unchanged in 2016 at $2.1 billion. The splits, as shown on this slide, are -- is also essentially the same. Our cash flow number appears to be coming in as we had projected, maybe $1.5 billion. With cash on hand, we easily can fund this $2.1 billion this year. As we look forward, we would say the same thing about 2017.
Turning then to Slide 7, and this is our production growth forecast and history. You could see that essentially, we're right on schedule when it comes to our production growth. The new forecast for 2016 being moved up to 14% from 13%, as I had mentioned. That gives us approximately a new number of 233,000-plus BOE per day. But if you look at the quarters, our quarter 3 was again substantially above our range. The fourth quarter production range we show here is a bit of an estimate only because, as has been evidenced by some of our earlier commentary and the material Frank put out last night, we have an upset [ph] at our Fain plant in West Panhandle field area. That is in the process of being rectified, but it's unclear how many more days that's going to take before we can get to full production. So what you see here is us being relatively conservative to make sure that we can get that plant back and in full operation. 
But as you look forward and if you look towards the future growth, we are reflecting on this slide a 15% CAGR growth rate through the end of the decade. If you do the math on this, this gets us over 400,000 barrels a day by 2020. And oil growth is, of course, a considerable component of that. 
There's been some discussions and questions that are raised by where we came out in terms of our oil content production for the third quarter showing at 56%, where we had 58% in the second quarter. Now this is relatively easily explained by the fact that we put in our target of gas plant in the Martin County area, referred to as the Buffalo plant, in April of this year. And of course, in doing so, we had to assess and project what sort of NGL recoveries we can get from that plant. It turns out they're substantially better than what we thought. And so we have to go back, in that sense, in the third quarter and do the accrual adjustment for those additional NGLs. So it's a very big positive and our NGL fraction of that plant is significantly higher than what we thought. 
In addition, if you then match it up with the fact that we had really substantially higher offset frac shut-in wells, we had about 5,000 barrels a day shut in, if you average for the second quarter. That increased to 10,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We're obviously very busy out in the field. We've got more rigs running. We have our own frac fleets running. We don't adjust down in terms of the quarter. And those frac fleets continue to work, and our shut-in production hours move up and down every week. But suffice it to say, on average, much higher shut-in production in the second quarter, and that's a good thing because that means we're actively working on new wells. 
The final thing I'd say in that regard is that our new wells do continue to show initial production percentages of about 80% for oil. And that's a good thing. The GORs do increase slightly through the course of the life of the wells. But suffice it to say, we're still seeing IPs of 80% oil. So that is all going seemingly well. And I would also follow up by saying that there are some discussions surrounding our oil growth. It was substantially higher in the second quarter than the third. And that has to do with a couple of factors. One is our POP numbers were substantially higher in the second quarter. About 69 wells were put on production, where in the third quarter as scheduled, we only had a lesser number, in this case, we POP 46 wells. By definition, your oil growth rate would be a little bit less in that scenario. And then in addition of which, the same effect occurs vis-à-vis the shutting in of offset frac wells. That is about a 5,000 barrel a day increase in the wells that are shut in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
But all in all, I guess the message is that our -- we are right on schedule on this forecast. And I think it bodes well for our ability to keep running the factory and keep moving forward with you in a higher level of activity. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joey Hall, who's our EVP of Permian operations."

I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the South",956,"Thanks, Tim. I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the Southern JV area, with 4 more wells added in the North and one in the South. We also continue to see a positive balance for our Version 3.0 completions when compared to 2.0 in the North, with 3 additional months of production data and 15 more wells. 
Same story with Version 3.0 completions in the South, with 5 additional wells added in Q3. And as we mentioned last quarter, the early results of the new POPs were masked somewhat due to choking, but we're now starting to see some good separation for our 3.0 completions.
Moving to Slide #9. Similar to the previous slide, we continue to see the improved performance from our Wolfcamp A wells in both the North and the South. In the North, Wolfcamp A Version 2.0, still showing a 25% productivity improvement, with 2 additional wells added to the mix. Wolfcamp A Version 3.0 wells in the North are also showing a performance improvement over 2.0, with 3 more months of production data and 8 new wells. There were no new 2.0 or 3.0 wells added in the Southern JV area in Q3. And of course, the same caveats apply on early choking of the new wells.
Moving to Slide 10, same story on Lower Spraberry Shale wells for our Version 2.0 completions, which are still tracking 10% above the 1 million a day type curve, with 10 new wells added. Just reiterating the messages from our recent well performance, 2.0 completions continue their strong performance in all intervals, with no retraction on our performance, as has been stated in the past. And early favorable returns on our 3.0 completions has led us to expand our optimization program from 80 to 100 wells. And we will continue to use choke management going forward to optimize utilize the utilization of our water disposal infrastructures. So some of the early results may be somewhat held back, but long-term performance is looking very good.
Moving to Slide 11, D&C costs have continued their downward trend, even though our completion sizes have increased materially with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions, which can add between $500,000 to $1.5 million to the cost of a well. For perspective, I recently compared this quarter to Q3 of 2015. And we are placing on average 25% more sand and 50% more water per well and drilling longer laterals for $145 less per foot than we were that Q3 of last year. 
I'd also like to emphasize the range of well costs in the upper right corner, which shows Lower Spraberry Shale wells averaging $670 per foot and also highlight that we delivered Wolfcamp A wells for an average of $5.8 million. 
The bigger graph, of course, only reflects Wolfcamp B wells, which also includes a growing population of what we refer to as lower Wolfcamp B wells, which are typically slower drilling than the upper B targets. Bottom line, when coupled with the improved well performance, our capital efficiency continues to improve.
Moving to Slide 12. This is a new slide, so I'll spend a little time explaining it. The data comes from IHS, and it captures new wells with at least 3 months of production data between September of 2015 and June of 2016. It's important to point out that the data is not normalized for lateral length, which will be an important point here in a moment. And the y-axis illustrates the number of new wells with at least 3 months of production, with the first production date after September of 2016. The x-axis is the average cumulative oil produced per well over a 3-month period. So whenever you look at this, some key takeaways, no surprise, the scale of activity is significantly above that of our peers in the Midland Basin, with Pioneer putting on nearly twice as many wells as our nearest competitor. So the next question is, at this high activity level, is there any dilution of inventory? However, in this case, you can see Pioneer is consistently delivering strong wells, which highlights the quality of our acreage position.
The fact that the data is not normalized further highlights that lateral length is important because it illustrates the contiguous nature of our acreage and our ability to consistently drill longer laterals. And then lastly, it demonstrates that our completion and optimization efforts continue to be successful.
Moving to Slide 13. Just a few highlights here, some of which have already been covered. We're in the process of increasing to 15 rigs in the near-term and will be at 17 rigs by year-end. We remain on target to put 230 horizontal wells on line with a mix of wells shown there. Version 2.0 completions remain the standard with another 20 wells moved to Version 3.0 from the original 80. And we're now forecasting 50% to 65% IRRs with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions in late October strip pricing.
Moving to Slide 14 and my last slide. Production growth remains strong, with production up to 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3. we're planning to put 60 new wells online in Q4, which will be weighted mostly late in the quarter, with production between 185,000 to 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This raises our year-end outlook in the Permian to 170,000-plus barrels of oil equivalent per day and 36% production and 38% oil growth over 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rich for the financial highlights."

I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This",705,"Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This is due to prices at the end of September being higher than those at the end of June 30 for those derivatives that are yet to price in the future. 
Also included in the quarter was an unusual item related to the deferred tax benefit because we're recognizing a tax credit on R&D work for horizontal drilling wells innovations that we've had from 2012 to 2015. So that was also $59 million going the other way or $0.35. So adjusted for mark-to-market derivatives and usual items, we were still at $22 million of income or $0.13.
Looking at the middle of the page, where you can see how we came in relative to guidance. You can see it by looking down that list that we came in better than expected or within guidance on all the items listed there, so another really strong quarter for the company.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. If you look at the bar charts there, you can see that oil was -- quarter-on-quarter was flat, with our realized prices being around $41.40 a barrel. If you look at NGLs, we were down 12%. That's mainly due to lower propane and ethane prices during the quarter. And then gas, if you look at the red bars there, was up 46% just due to supply and demand fundamental changes that we've seen over the last few months. 
If you look at the bottom part of this slide, on derivatives, you can see that the company continues to benefit from our strong derivative position. During the quarter, we recognized $184 million of incremental cash flow. That brings us to $533 million for the year through 9 months.
Turning to Slide 17, looking at production costs. You can see here by looking at the chart that we continue to trend lower. We're down 6%, as Scott mentioned, quarter-on-quarter, and it's mainly driven by our cost-reduction initiatives and mainly on costs on repair costs, maintenance costs, chemical costs, those are all down significantly over the time period shown here. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. They're benefiting from the new Spraberry/Wolfcamp wells that we're drilling that Scott talked about at $2 operating cost before taxes and $4 all in.
Turning to Slide 18. This is -- in the second quarter we've shown our cash margins by asset. And once again, it just highlights the cash margins that are being generated in our Permian horizontal wells, just under $30 for this quarter, 70% on oil for the reasons that Tim talked about. So really, just highlights why we continue to invest over 90% of our capital budget into the Permian drilling, and just given the high rate of return, these projects generated 50% to 65%.
Turning to Slide 19, our liquidity position. Excellent liquidity position with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million, undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, so terrific financial position. If you look at the maturity chart there, it is worth noting that the March 2017 bond maturity has already been pre- funded. We plan to pay that with cash on hand in March of next year.
Turning to Slide 20, looking at our fourth quarter outlook. Production guidance is 237,000 to 242,000 BOEs a day, really reflecting the downtime at West Panhandle. So that's 2,000 to 5,000 barrels a day lower than we probably normally would have been, and then obviously reflects our legacy assets that we're are not investing capital in today and their decline. 
The other item that is a change is production costs. You can see that $7.75 per BOE to $9.75 per BOE, really reflecting our lower run rate. And the rest of the items here are all consistent with our third quarter results and prior quarter guidance. I'm not going to go through those individually, but they're there for your review and modeling purposes. 
So with that, Anna, I think we'll open the call for questions."

And we're looking pretty strongly at a program next year that we'll certainly have a majority, maybe all of our wells will be 3.0 or most of them will be.

It's -- right now we're in a situation where in the third quarter, as I mentioned, we had 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That is highly visible when you look at the numbers. I expect though with our activity levels increasing, for example in the fourth quarter, we're are also estimating about 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That's in our forecast. But as you go forward, I think there'll be a percentage of shut-in wells that correspond to the activity level. And the other way to look at it is, as you know, because we've talked about this from time to time, part of this year's campaign and certainly part of next year's drilling campaign and completion campaign will have us coming back to areas where we've already drilled and completed B wells and drilling the A wells that correspond to those B wells. So what that means is, to be safe, we need to go ahead and shut in the associated B wells. So that's a natural fact as we go to an A campaign, we're shutting in B wells. And so it's really a mix of things, but suffice it to say, shut-in wells should be essentially linear with activity levels."

One of the things that we do anytime we have a design change of this significance, and particularly with the fact that we're doing so much choking, is we're a heavy user of downhole gauges.

The other part of it that's been emphasized a couple of times that I think is the most important indication is the reality of adoption. My -- what I've discovered is that typically, good news stays good news over the entire life of the well. And then sometimes, news that may seem uncertain works itself out over in time and becomes good news. So the areas where we start to see news on the early parts of the well, that leads us to have early adoption as opposed to wait to do something different. So for me, the latter part tells us that the technical work's been done, and we've made a decision to adopt and go forward."

The answer is it includes running 17 rigs all year. The thing that you're probably thinking about is, if you have a sense that maybe that number is a little high, is remember that we are drilling more wells now, maybe 15, 16 wells a year with the same number of rigs, and we're completing those. Our completion cost, while overall, they've been coming down, if we go to all 3.0 wells next year, that would have a tendency to skew that number up. On infrastructure, with more activity, we'll probably be spending at least the same, if not more, on tank batteries. We do have a new target plant that we will have a 27% interest in to pay next year. But probably, if you look at our other spending, this year, I think we spent something like $150 million. And if you remember when we've talked about our forecast going forward in this model that Rich and his guys have put together, we've been spending about $300 million for vertical integration, water, those type of expenditures. Next year, I would anticipate with our water buildout, because we can now use -- you saw on Joey's slide, we're the league leader in a number of wells that we're drilling and putting on production, we're going to need a hell lot of water with these bigger fracs. So we're going to extend the scope of our mainline from the South into the North. We will likely start up the Midland project next year to take water from the city of Midland. So I would not be surprised to see that other infrastructure or other capital number at least double and probably go a little bit higher than that next year. Again, those numbers are in flux. So we're giving you a $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. It's kind of primary number. But based on the early work we've done, that's probably within the area that we think we're going to spend."

First of all, as you know, we're extremely pleased with the Devon transaction as the Sale Ranch acres that comes with that is really some of our very best acreage. And that's why that transaction was so important to us to accomplish. We do believe those types of transactions will be relatively few and far between. It's hard to find inventory out there that's as good as what we own and the inventory that will then have the effect of high grading our own inventory. That said, we think when we do a transaction like the Devon transaction, we should also carve some assets off the bottom of our portfolio. And toward that end, we have 3 individual efforts underway, one of which is in full gate right now. This is the sale of some acreage in Andrews County. It's about 6,000 -- or 7,000 net acres. And we're right in the process of the data room to work on that. In addition, I think it will be later this year or perhaps will extend into next year, a 20,000-acre or so package in Northeast Martin County. And it's possible we'll have one smaller package in addition. So we'll see how those things go, but our whole objective here is to be able to say that a transaction like Devon is net-net, when our smoke clears, very accretive to our portfolio."

I think it's next week. And we'll look at that from time to time. It really has to do, of course, with arbitrage opportunity presented by international crude prices, in this case, Brent, which WTI squares up against nicely in terms of quality, and WTI prices in the United States. So over the last -- actually, since the export ban, which Scott was so instrumental in bringing to fruition, what's happened is you had a situation which you'd expect, which is really the 2 crudes and differing only by their transportation differentials. And that means there's not a lot of use in terms of exporting. Now we have made many exporting, but it's not significant to the overall value of the barrel. However, moving it out of the United States when we're in a relatively high inventory situation, I think, net-net, it makes sense, especially if we can add to margin to the value of those barrels. So you'll continue to see us looking at those opportunities as one of many opportunities for the final disposition of our sales. And that will be probably true for the rest of industry. The rest of the industry is up, but I think our total export has sort of been exceeding 500,000 barrels a day, including Canada. And that could increase through time. But again, now we're talking about economic proposition. We're not talking about a situation where we're forcing it to happen. It'll happen to the extent the values are there."

I think the way that I would consider that, Brian, is that as we continue to increase activity levels, by definition, we keep a ceiling on this production cost number, that is to the extent of other older walls are declining, their operating costs per BOE goes up by definition. We match it up with more new wells with higher volumes that tend to supersede those declines. So I think you'll reach some sort of asymptote here before too long, where that's going to be the case, and it's probably in the low 2s. As it relates to inflation, production cost is probably the one area where we have risks of inflation. It's because the majority of production costs are things like personnel, chemicals, power, all of which are very difficult for us to hedge in any significant way. So if we have any risk of inflation, that's probably where it is. Now I think if you look at the state of Texas, power costs are extremely low. We benefit from wind power here substantially because of that. We've got great chemical contracts. I think the labor workforce will probably be needing some bumps on this to compensation just to get more workers back in the basin. But I think we can control a lot of that, and I don't really see any substantial risks of any really serious blowout when it comes to inflation hurting our production costs."

I think that one thing we'll benefit from is we had certain rigs that are -- that we are now bringing out of stack. We'll have essentially no stack rig costs for most of 2017. And several of those rigs, at least half of those rigs will come off the existing contracts that were, at the time of their signing, at something like $26,000 a day. We'll re-sign those at whatever the then current market is. Today, it's maybe 14 or so. And so we can see savings that comes from that. I think we'll continue to nickel and dime away at these costs. But you're right, to the extent we mix in more 3.0s, we could see these, that the numbers sort of bottoming out. As to the inflation effects here, here, I think we're very well protected. We can argue all day long about when service companies are going to have pricing power, but the fact is we're doing our own completions. We have 5 fleets running today. We know what the costs of those are. So we're not going to be subject to cost increases on completions, which is, as you know, by far the biggest costs of the wells. And in fact, we may have reductions in drilling cost, as I mentioned. So I think overall, we are well protected from any kind of inflationary issues when it comes to our capital program. And I think that will continue through 2017. And for my money, I don't think the service companies will have a lot of pricing power until we get well into '18, and that's predicated on higher prices."

As Frank said, as most of you know, this is my last earnings call after 25 years of being public. I want to extend a special thanks to all shareholders and to all analysts on the call and our great relationship that we've had over the years. 
I'd like to give a brief message before I review the first 2 financial and operating highlights slides.  As a continuing large, long-term shareholder and board member, I have 100% confidence in Tim and the management team that will continue to make this company the premier shale company in the world. We have the best rocks and balance sheet and the best employees in the industry. What company can easily grow 15% per year for 10 years and move up to over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in a $47 to $57 oil price environment? If you look at the Permian only, that growth rate is well over 20% over those 10 years. What company has over 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent with over 20,000 locations and an average net revenue interest of 85% and essentially has 0 basis on those locations, except for the recent Devon transaction, and in an environment where companies are paying $40,000 to $60,000 per acre? In addition, we're growing our oil mix from 57% this year to 62% next year and over 70% over the next 10 years.
With regard to oil prices, we're obviously not out of the woods yet. I give OPEC a 40% chance of reaching agreement on November 30, and they do, everyone will cheat. I have seen this over my 42-year career.  The market will not balance until 2018. That is why Pioneer is best positioned among oil companies with great hedges in place for '17 and the best balance sheet in the industry.
Now we'll go to Slide #3 in financial and operating highlights. We had adjusted income for the quarter of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter production, 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, above Pioneer's guidance range of 232,000 to 237,000, an increase of 6,000 barrels a day or 3% versus second quarter, obviously driven by the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal program and our completion optimization program. We did have an unplanned downtime at Fain gas plant, which affected the quarter by 2,000 barrels a day from West Panhandle production. We did place 46 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp in the third quarter with strong performance, including 28 wells from 3.0 version, again, the 3.0 version significantly outperforming 2.0. We did expand our 3.0 from 80 wells to 100 wells. Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp, again through completion optimization, longer lateral lengths, enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are continuing to drive down cost per lateral foot.
On Slide #4, reduced production cost per BOE by 6% since second quarter of '16 and 32% since third quarter of 2015. And yes, as some people may question, our horizontal Permian operating costs are $2, excluding taxes. Enhanced Martin County acreage position by closing purchase of 28,000 net acres from Devon for $429 million. With the export ban removed last year, we did sell our first 2 Permian oil cargoes for export to Europe in the third quarter. 
We repaid mid-July debt maturity of $455 million with cash on hand. And with the recent run-up, of course, obviously 3 or 4 weeks ago, with oil prices, we did increase our '17 derivative coverage to 75% for oil and 55% for gas, up from 50% from last quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to our next CEO, Tim Dove."

I share Frank's good wishes you going forward. As we've been discussing for some time, we are in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition",1330,"Thanks, Scott. I share Frank's good wishes you going forward. 
As we've been discussing for some time, we are in midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. And we have a couple of more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition of 5 rigs. That will put us with 17 rigs in the northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp area by year-end. 
Our capital program remains essentially unchanged. It's been that way for some time, as is the Devon transaction was announced for $2.1 billion. The truth that these rigs that I mentioned a moment ago will not really have a significant production adds until 2017, however, just the fact that we're improving our productivity in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field area with a horizontal drilling campaign and completions optimization is allowing us to actually increase our forecast for this year's production from 13% plus to 14% plus. We see now, even with the 17-rig count maintained flat, that we would expect to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% next year. Really, what we're finding of course is we can continue to do more with less as we continue to optimize our program.
The 2017 campaign of drilling is well funded already with our balance sheet on the one hand and also, as Scott had mentioned, our strong derivatives position having been built up considerably over the last few weeks and our cash flow assumptions based on strip prices. 
Current 2017 capital budget is far from finalized. There's a lot of discussions, of course, that are ongoing with our partners and internally as to where we're going to land the budget. But suffice it to say, we currently are looking at numbers that are in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion for 2017. 
One of our more critical messages in this whole presentation is in the yellow box at the bottom of Slide 5. And it's the fact that, as Scott had mentioned, we are on a plan here to increase our annual production growth rate to about 15% for several years and in doing so, keeping exceptionally strong balance sheet, in this case, net debt to operating cash flow below 1, even using only strip prices. And in addition, we mentioned we'd grow our production at that 15% rate, our actual compound annual growth rate of cash flow exceeds that and is approximately 25%. That has to do with drilling projects that are higher-margin oil based in terms of their returns. And one of the major components of this is, and our internal modeling certainly supports the fact that we can do this while spending within cash flow as early as 2018, and that's assuming about a $55 per barrel oil price case. So this is what we are focused on, really, for the next several years. One of the main components of which is, at minimum, cash flow neutrality, which, as I said, I think we can reach 2018.
Turning now to Slide 6. I mentioned a moment ago our capital budget remains essentially unchanged in 2016 at $2.1 billion. The splits, as shown on this slide, are -- is also essentially the same. Our cash flow number appears to be coming in as we had projected, maybe $1.5 billion. With cash on hand, we easily can fund this $2.1 billion this year. As we look forward, we would say the same thing about 2017.
Turning then to Slide 7, and this is our production growth forecast and history. You could see that essentially, we're right on schedule when it comes to our production growth. The new forecast for 2016 being moved up to 14% from 13%, as I had mentioned. That gives us approximately a new number of 233,000-plus BOE per day. But if you look at the quarters, our quarter 3 was again substantially above our range. The fourth quarter production range we show here is a bit of an estimate only because, as has been evidenced by some of our earlier commentary and the material Frank put out last night, we have an upset [ph] at our Fain plant in West Panhandle field area. That is in the process of being rectified, but it's unclear how many more days that's going to take before we can get to full production. So what you see here is us being relatively conservative to make sure that we can get that plant back and in full operation. 
But as you look forward and if you look towards the future growth, we are reflecting on this slide a 15% CAGR growth rate through the end of the decade. If you do the math on this, this gets us over 400,000 barrels a day by 2020. And oil growth is, of course, a considerable component of that. 
There's been some discussions and questions that are raised by where we came out in terms of our oil content production for the third quarter showing at 56%, where we had 58% in the second quarter. Now this is relatively easily explained by the fact that we put in our target of gas plant in the Martin County area, referred to as the Buffalo plant, in April of this year. And of course, in doing so, we had to assess and project what sort of NGL recoveries we can get from that plant. It turns out they're substantially better than what we thought. And so we have to go back, in that sense, in the third quarter and do the accrual adjustment for those additional NGLs. So it's a very big positive and our NGL fraction of that plant is significantly higher than what we thought. 
In addition, if you then match it up with the fact that we had really substantially higher offset frac shut-in wells, we had about 5,000 barrels a day shut in, if you average for the second quarter. That increased to 10,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We're obviously very busy out in the field. We've got more rigs running. We have our own frac fleets running. We don't adjust down in terms of the quarter. And those frac fleets continue to work, and our shut-in production hours move up and down every week. But suffice it to say, on average, much higher shut-in production in the second quarter, and that's a good thing because that means we're actively working on new wells. 
The final thing I'd say in that regard is that our new wells do continue to show initial production percentages of about 80% for oil. And that's a good thing. The GORs do increase slightly through the course of the life of the wells. But suffice it to say, we're still seeing IPs of 80% oil. So that is all going seemingly well. And I would also follow up by saying that there are some discussions surrounding our oil growth. It was substantially higher in the second quarter than the third. And that has to do with a couple of factors. One is our POP numbers were substantially higher in the second quarter. About 69 wells were put on production, where in the third quarter as scheduled, we only had a lesser number, in this case, we POP 46 wells. By definition, your oil growth rate would be a little bit less in that scenario. And then in addition of which, the same effect occurs vis-à-vis the shutting in of offset frac wells. That is about a 5,000 barrel a day increase in the wells that are shut in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
But all in all, I guess the message is that our -- we are right on schedule on this forecast. And I think it bodes well for our ability to keep running the factory and keep moving forward with you in a higher level of activity. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joey Hall, who's our EVP of Permian operations."

I'm going to be picking up on Slide #8. Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues.

Here, you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the North and 25% in the Southern JV area, with 4 more wells added in the North and one in the South. We also continue to see a positive balance for our Version 3.0 completions when compared to 2.0 in the North, with 3 additional months of production data and 15 more wells. 
Same story with Version 3.0 completions in the South, with 5 additional wells added in Q3. And as we mentioned last quarter, the early results of the new POPs were masked somewhat due to choking, but we're now starting to see some good separation for our 3.0 completions.
Moving to Slide #9. Similar to the previous slide, we continue to see the improved performance from our Wolfcamp A wells in both the North and the South. In the North, Wolfcamp A Version 2.0, still showing a 25% productivity improvement, with 2 additional wells added to the mix. Wolfcamp A Version 3.0 wells in the North are also showing a performance improvement over 2.0, with 3 more months of production data and 8 new wells. There were no new 2.0 or 3.0 wells added in the Southern JV area in Q3. And of course, the same caveats apply on early choking of the new wells.
Moving to Slide 10, same story on Lower Spraberry Shale wells for our Version 2.0 completions, which are still tracking 10% above the 1 million a day type curve, with 10 new wells added. Just reiterating the messages from our recent well performance, 2.0 completions continue their strong performance in all intervals, with no retraction on our performance, as has been stated in the past. And early favorable returns on our 3.0 completions has led us to expand our optimization program from 80 to 100 wells. And we will continue to use choke management going forward to optimize utilize the utilization of our water disposal infrastructures. So some of the early results may be somewhat held back, but long-term performance is looking very good.
Moving to Slide 11, D&C costs have continued their downward trend, even though our completion sizes have increased materially with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions, which can add between $500,000 to $1.5 million to the cost of a well. For perspective, I recently compared this quarter to Q3 of 2015. And we are placing on average 25% more sand and 50% more water per well and drilling longer laterals for $145 less per foot than we were that Q3 of last year. 
I'd also like to emphasize the range of well costs in the upper right corner, which shows Lower Spraberry Shale wells averaging $670 per foot and also highlight that we delivered Wolfcamp A wells for an average of $5.8 million. 
The bigger graph, of course, only reflects Wolfcamp B wells, which also includes a growing population of what we refer to as lower Wolfcamp B wells, which are typically slower drilling than the upper B targets. Bottom line, when coupled with the improved well performance, our capital efficiency continues to improve.
Moving to Slide 12. This is a new slide, so I'll spend a little time explaining it. The data comes from IHS, and it captures new wells with at least 3 months of production data between September of 2015 and June of 2016. It's important to point out that the data is not normalized for lateral length, which will be an important point here in a moment. And the y-axis illustrates the number of new wells with at least 3 months of production, with the first production date after September of 2016. The x-axis is the average cumulative oil produced per well over a 3-month period. So whenever you look at this, some key takeaways, no surprise, the scale of activity is significantly above that of our peers in the Midland Basin, with Pioneer putting on nearly twice as many wells as our nearest competitor. So the next question is, at this high activity level, is there any dilution of inventory? However, in this case, you can see Pioneer is consistently delivering strong wells, which highlights the quality of our acreage position.
The fact that the data is not normalized further highlights that lateral length is important because it illustrates the contiguous nature of our acreage and our ability to consistently drill longer laterals. And then lastly, it demonstrates that our completion and optimization efforts continue to be successful.
Moving to Slide 13. Just a few highlights here, some of which have already been covered. We're in the process of increasing to 15 rigs in the near-term and will be at 17 rigs by year-end. We remain on target to put 230 horizontal wells on line with a mix of wells shown there. Version 2.0 completions remain the standard with another 20 wells moved to Version 3.0 from the original 80. And we're now forecasting 50% to 65% IRRs with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions in late October strip pricing.
Moving to Slide 14 and my last slide. Production growth remains strong, with production up to 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3. We’re planning to put 60 new wells online in Q4, which will be weighted mostly late in the quarter, with production between 185,000 to 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This raises our year-end outlook in the Permian to 170,000-plus barrels of oil equivalent per day and 36% production and 38% oil growth over 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rich for the financial highlights."

I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This",705,"Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on Slide 15. We reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after tax or $0.35 per share. This is due to prices at the end of September being higher than those at the end of June 30 for those derivatives that are yet to price in the future. 
Also included in the quarter was an unusual item related to the deferred tax benefit because we're recognizing a tax credit on R&D work for horizontal drilling wells innovations that we've had from 2012 to 2015. So that was also $59 million going the other way or $0.35. So adjusted for mark-to-market derivatives and usual items, we were still at $22 million of income or $0.13.
Looking at the middle of the page, where you can see how we came in relative to guidance. You can see it by looking down that list that we came in better than expected or within guidance on all the items listed there, so another really strong quarter for the company.
Turning to Slide 16, look at price realizations. If you look at the bar charts there, you can see that oil was -- quarter-on-quarter was flat, with our realized prices being around $41.40 a barrel. If you look at NGLs, we were down 12%. That's mainly due to lower propane and ethane prices during the quarter. And then gas, if you look at the red bars there, was up 46% just due to supply and demand fundamental changes that we've seen over the last few months. 
If you look at the bottom part of this slide, on derivatives, you can see that the company continues to benefit from our strong derivative position. During the quarter, we recognized $184 million of incremental cash flow. That brings us to $533 million for the year through 9 months.
Turning to Slide 17, looking at production costs. You can see here by looking at the chart that we continue to trend lower. We're down 6%, as Scott mentioned, quarter-on-quarter, and it's mainly driven by our cost-reduction initiatives and mainly on costs on repair costs, maintenance costs, chemical costs, those are all down significantly over the time period shown here. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower. They're benefiting from the new Spraberry/Wolfcamp wells that we're drilling that Scott talked about at $2 operating cost before taxes and $4 all in.
Turning to Slide 18. This is -- in the second quarter we've shown our cash margins by asset. And once again, it just highlights the cash margins that are being generated in our Permian horizontal wells, just under $30 for this quarter, 70% on oil for the reasons that Tim talked about. So really, just highlights why we continue to invest over 90% of our capital budget into the Permian drilling, and just given the high rate of return, these projects generated 50% to 65%.
Turning to Slide 19, our liquidity position. Excellent liquidity position with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million, undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion, so terrific financial position. If you look at the maturity chart there, it is worth noting that the March 2017 bond maturity has already been pre- funded. We plan to pay that with cash on hand in March of next year.
Turning to Slide 20, looking at our fourth quarter outlook. Production guidance is 237,000 to 242,000 BOEs a day, really reflecting the downtime at West Panhandle. So that's 2,000 to 5,000 barrels a day lower than we probably normally would have been, and then obviously reflects our legacy assets that we're are not investing capital in today and their decline. 
The other item that is a change is production costs. You can see that $7.75 per BOE to $9.75 per BOE, really reflecting our lower run rate. And the rest of the items here are all consistent with our third quarter results and prior quarter guidance. I'm not going to go through those individually, but they're there for your review and modeling purposes. 
So with that, Anna, I think we'll open the call for questions."

I mean, to the extent we have more rigs running more wells getting completed, this type of shut-in data in the background becomes less and less discernible. It's -- right now we're in a situation where in the third quarter, as I mentioned, we had 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That is highly visible when you look at the numbers. I expect though with our activity levels increasing, for example in the fourth quarter, we’re also estimating about 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That's in our forecast. But as you go forward, I think there'll be a percentage of shut-in wells that correspond to the activity level. And the other way to look at it is, as you know, because we've talked about this from time to time, part of this year's campaign and certainly part of next year's drilling campaign and completion campaign will have us coming back to areas where we've already drilled and completed B wells and drilling the A wells that correspond to those B wells. So what that means is, to be safe, we need to go ahead and shut in the associated B wells. So that's a natural fact as we go to an A campaign, we're shutting in B wells. And so it's really a mix of things, but suffice it to say, shut-in wells should be essentially linear with activity levels."

And what I can tell you is that the data that we see from that is very optimistic. And it helps us build that we understand that the downside of the choking and the upside of the unchoked production. The other part of it that's been emphasized a couple of times that I think is the most important indication is the reality of adoption. My -- what I've discovered is that typically, good news stays good news over the entire life of the well. And then sometimes, news that may seem uncertain works itself out over in time and becomes good news. So the areas where we start to see news on the early parts of the well, that leads us to have early adoption as opposed to wait to do something different. So for me, the latter part tells us that the technical work's been done, and we've made a decision to adopt and go forward."

The thing that you're probably thinking about is, if you have a sense that maybe that number is a little high, is remember that we are drilling more wells now, maybe 15, 16 wells a year with the same number of rigs, and we're completing those. Our completion cost, while overall, they've been coming down, if we go to all 3.0 wells next year, that would have a tendency to skew that number up. On infrastructure, with more activity, we'll probably be spending at least the same, if not more, on tank batteries. We do have a new target plant that we will have a 27% interest in to pay next year. But probably, if you look at our other spending, this year, I think we spent something like $150 million. And if you remember when we've talked about our forecast going forward in this model that Rich and his guys have put together, we've been spending about $300 million for vertical integration, water, those type of expenditures. Next year, I would anticipate with our water buildout, because we can now use -- you saw on Joey's slide, we're the league leader in a number of wells that we're drilling and putting on production, we're going to need a hell lot of water with these bigger fracs. So we're going to extend the scope of our mainline from the South into the North. We will likely start up the Midland project next year to take water from the city of Midland. So I would not be surprised to see that other infrastructure or other capital number at least double and probably go a little bit higher than that next year. Again, those numbers are in flux. So we're giving you a $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. It's kind of primary number. But based on the early work we've done, that's probably within the area that we think we're going to spend."

And toward that end, we have 3 individual efforts underway, one of which is in full gate right now. This is the sale of some acreage in Andrews County. It's about 6,000 -- or 7,000 net acres. And we're right in the process of the data room to work on that. In addition, I think it will be later this year or perhaps will extend into next year, a 20,000-acre or so package in Northeast Martin County. And it's possible we'll have one smaller package in addition. So we'll see how those things go, but our whole objective here is to be able to say that a transaction like Devon is net-net, when our smoke clears, very accretive to our portfolio."

I think it's next week. And we'll look at that from time to time. It really has to do, of course, with arbitrage opportunity presented by international crude prices, in this case, Brent, which WTI squares up against nicely in terms of quality, and WTI prices in the United States. So over the last -- actually, since the export ban, which Scott was so instrumental in bringing to fruition, what's happened is you had a situation which you'd expect, which is really the 2 crudes and differing only by their transportation differentials. And that means there's not a lot of use in terms of exporting. Now we have made many exporting, but it's not significant to the overall value of the barrel. However, moving it out of the United States when we're in a relatively high inventory situation, I think, net-net, it makes sense, especially if we can add to margin to the value of those barrels. So you'll continue to see us looking at those opportunities as one of many opportunities for the final disposition of our sales. And that will be probably true for the rest of industry. The rest of the industry is up, but I think our total export has sort of been exceeding 500,000 barrels a day, including Canada. And that could increase through time. But again, now we're talking about economic proposition. We're not talking about a situation where we're forcing it to happen. It'll happen to the extent the values are there."

I think the way that I would consider that, Brian, is that as we continue to increase activity levels, by definition, we keep a ceiling on this production cost number, that is to the extent of other older walls are declining, their operating costs per BOE goes up by definition. We match it up with more new wells with higher volumes that tend to supersede those declines. So I think you'll reach some sort of asymptote here before too long, where that's going to be the case, and it's probably in the low 2s. As it relates to inflation, production cost is probably the one area where we have risks of inflation. It's because the majority of production costs are things like personnel, chemicals, power, all of which are very difficult for us to hedge in any significant way. So if we have any risk of inflation, that's probably where it is. Now I think if you look at the state of Texas, power costs are extremely low. We benefit from wind power here substantially because of that. We've got great chemical contracts. I think the labor workforce will probably be needing some bumps on this to compensation just to get more workers back in the basin. But I think we can control a lot of that, and I don't really see any substantial risks of any really serious blowout when it comes to inflation hurting our production costs."

I think that one thing we'll benefit from is we had certain rigs that are -- that we are now bringing out of stack. We'll have essentially no stack rig costs for most of 2017. And several of those rigs, at least half of those rigs will come off the existing contracts that were, at the time of their signing, at something like $26,000 a day. We'll re-sign those at whatever the then current market is. Today, it's maybe 14 or so. And so we can see savings that comes from that. I think we'll continue to nickel and dime away at these costs. But you're right, to the extent we mix in more 3.0s, we could see these, that the numbers sort of bottoming out. As to the inflation effects here, here, I think we're very well protected. We can argue all day long about when service companies are going to have pricing power, but the fact is we're doing our own completions. We have 5 fleets running today. We know what the costs of those are. So we're not going to be subject to cost increases on completions, which is, as you know, by far the biggest costs of the wells. And in fact, we may have reductions in drilling cost, as I mentioned. So I think overall, we are well protected from any kind of inflationary issues when it comes to our capital program. And I think that will continue through 2017. And for my money, I don't think the service companies will have a lot of pricing power until we get well into '18, and that's predicated on higher prices."

I think as I mentioned a minute ago, Matt, commodity prices are a big player here. And in this particular case where we operate in the play, the price of natural gas and NGLs become critical to the play. And particularly on the NGL front, ethane prices is about 40% of what we produce in NGLs in Eagle Ford or ethane. We have seen some cooperation with gas prices now. Some of that's peeled back. Ethane prices have done essentially the same thing. I think ethane has some potential for improvement as we get into '17 and '18. So the economics certainly have some room to improve from here before we make those decisions, but that will certainly be the #1 factor. Of course, in association with our obligations to enterprise and our throughput agreements in Eagle Ford, we have minimum daily requirements for efficiency fees if we don't meet those. And we could offset some of those by drilling, which will be a positive as well."

I just wanted to come back to something, but you guys have asked and answered most of the questions already. But in the discussion about offset fracs, you guys talked about coming in with your layering in the Wolfcamp As over the existing Bs, I think. And could you just remind us what information you guys have extending about communication between laterals when you do that, and whether that information, if you do have it, is based off of older completion designs, which were used lesser than your wellbore fracturing? And yes, just any update you guys might have on that."

Of course, as you go across the field, as the frac barrier varies, the communication varies as well. But generally speaking, whenever we do stimulate an A well, we are going to shut in the B wells. And we're going to shut them in until the A well is drilled out and bring them back online continuously. We've done quite a bit of interference testing over the last couple of years to understand the communication between the 2. It's not similar across the entire field. It varies again based on the frac barrier strength. But I do believe we have a really good feeling for the way that those wells do communicate. But we certainly don't want to deteriorate the quality of an A well by not shutting in that B well. So we feel strongly enough to where we're going to do that consistently."
