I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks are a little long, but be assured we will leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
Yesterday, we reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.27 per share, 10.4% better than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our full comparable -- our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, 10.5% better than 2014. If we were to exclude our real estate fund, the increase over 2014 would have been 16.3%.  Our earnings growth was driven by our flagship New York business, and as David will cover shortly, our New York business will continue to produce strong growth in 2015. 
Company-wide, in 2015, we leased 5,381,000 square feet in 483 transactions with overall positive mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 12% cash. In New York, we leased 2,276,000 square feet for the year and 610,000 square feet for the fourth quarter at positive GAAP mark-to-markets of 22.8% for the year and an even higher 25.7% for the fourth quarter. These are great numbers. Mitchell and David will give you details of their businesses shortly. Washington has now a tale of slow recovery  being dragged down by Skyline. 
With respect to Penn Plaza, we are delighted that Governor Cuomo has shined a bright light on the importance of Penn Station as New York City's busiest transportation hub and a crying need for improvement. Vornado will be a full participant in this process. The Penn Plaza District, where we have the dominant owner with 9 million square feet is a great opportunity for us. We are knee-deep in planning multiple projects to transform and enhance our vast Penn Plaza holdings. We are the industry leader in capital programs to reposition and upgrade office and retail assets so as to achieve their full potential. As David will tell you, next up is our grand plan to update and upgrade, modernize and transform One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza into an integrated 4.2 million square-foot complex sitting directly on top of Penn Station in the center of what has become New York's new West Side. The goal here is to achieve market rents as much as 50% higher than today's rents. 
Almost a year ago in my letter to shareholders and in each of our last 3 [ph] quarterly calls, I stated that the easy money has been made for the cycle as the prices are high well past the 2007 peak, it's a better time to sell and to invest. And most importantly, now is the time of the cycle when the smart guys build cash for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. To be honest, I didn't expect to be so right so quickly. With many sectors of the economy decelerating, we have experienced a period of high volatility in both the credit markets and the equity markets. This will, of course, have some effect on the real estate market. So we have been preparing for all this for whatever is to come. Vornado is buttoned up and ready. Our New York properties are very well leased, we are basically full. Our income stream is diversified coming from over 1,200 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Our top 10 tenants account for only 13.2% of revenue. It is a testament to the quality of our assets and our leasing machine that Victoria's Secret chose in a very competitive take off to locate their 64,000 [ph] square-foot Fifth Avenue flagship with us. Same for Facebook, Amazon, Footlocker and Neuberger Berman and on and on, you get the picture. 
In this environment, cash is king. Today, we have $4.5 million of immediate -- $4.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and our fully undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. On top of that, we have over $13 billion of highest-quality unencumbered properties. 
Last year in my annual letter to shareholders, on Page 10 if you would like to reread it, I laid out our debt philosophy. Vornado enjoys access to the 4 corners of the capital markets. We prefer secured debt that is recourse solely to a single property rather than unsecured corporate debt that bears the full faith and credit of the issuer, sort of like a personal guaranty. It is interesting to note that today, secured debt for a sponsor of the standing -- of our standing is both readily available and surprisingly cheaper than the unsecured fullface and credit-type debt. The unsecured and CMBS debt markets are getting a little jumpy. Vornado today has all the $850 [ph] million of unsecured debt in 2 issues, maturing 4 and 7 years out. 
Vornado is focused and simplified and ready for battle, having sold, spun or approved over $8.7 billion of assets. True to our word, we have sold so much more than we have acquired. Acquisitions have been limited to strategic New York retail properties and creative class value-added office projects. We have pushed the way from acquisitions which were off the fairway, nonstrategic, or most importantly, overpriced. Importantly, we have also significantly upgraded the mix and quality of our assets. For example, trading 1740 Broadway, B office building for the St. Regis retail, a 66 UN Plaza for 655 Fifth Avenue retail with Ferragamo store, the Green Acres B+ mall for the retail block at 666 Fifth Avenue and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue for Old Navy on 34th street. 
three years ago, anticipating secular change, note the current softness in retail and recognizing that with only a handful of moss, we were in no man's land, we decided to exit all non-Manhattan retail. I believe this decision will look better and better and better as each year goes by. 
A word about our shopping center spend Urban Edge Properties. Celebrating its first anniversary, we couldn't be more delighted with this performance. We created UE by ceding it with our unique, high variant, northeastern shopping center assets. And with our management and staff, we recruited Jeff Olson, a best-in-class CEO, and morphed it with a strong balance sheet supported by an experienced and engaged board. Urban Edge is producing the exact result we had expected. And investors, the final report card, are rewarding UE with an appropriate stock price, which, by the way, has held rock solid in the recent months of carnage. And think about it, if the UE assets were still bundled inside Vornado, they probably will be valued at a big discount just like Vornado is. Given the success of UE, the concept of labor -- laser-focused, smaller entities may well be a template for the future. 
Our 220 Central Park South supertall residential condominium tower is also buttoned up. It is now 260 feet vertical and visible from Central Park. It will rise at the rate of 1 floor per week. We have dedicated super-low interest rate financing in place sufficient to fund that entire project. We are over 50% under contract at record setting pricing, which covers our cost. We will deliver in 2018, and trust me, there will be at least 2 up-and-down cycles before then. That's sort of a joke. 
As asset values have risen over the cycle, we have pulled back from making loans, especially mezzanine loans. We now have only a couple of small loans left on our books. 
Now if I may, a few words about the New York real estate markets. We see no real tick up so far in the Class A market. Vornado's office business continues to perform at very high levels. We do anticipate that decision-makers will take note of the financial volatility and pause, slow down and rethink a little. Of course, we are constantly looking at our shoulders, that's our job. But business is continues to be great, so far, so good. David and Mitchell will discuss the health of their markets with you in a moment. My personal favorite, as David will tell you, is that a full 25% of Vornado's New York leasing in 2015 was at rents over $100 per foot. Pretty amazing. I was going to say they will move over more, but my team won't let me say it. But I'll just say it. 
Nationwide, retail sales are soft and shopping center traffic has been declining quarter-over-quarter. In Manhattan, as I've said before, momentum in investors have driven retail asset prices too wide. Landlord asking rents are also too high, exceeding retailer's willingness and ability to pay. Trust me, we are the biggest player in this market by far, and we are in the process of being realistic in terms of pricing and making deals. And in all basis, we sure have. 
Hotels are soft. Just look at the hotel stocks, which are off 1/3 to 1/2. In my mind, the New York hotel industry is the victim of gross cyclical oversupply, even more than the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. New York has added 25,000 rooms in 2010 to a base of 82,000 rooms with 18,000 more rooms under construction, too much supply. And then, of course, there is Airbnb, sort of like what e-shopping is to brick-and-mortar retailing. Interestingly, while people say that the strong dollar is causing a decline in tourism, the numbers show that both domestic and international tourism are holding up just fine. Vornado has a very limited exposure to the hotel market, principally, the Hotel Pennsylvania, which is really a parking lot. 
The for-sale condo business has dramatically slowed at all price points and in all neighborhoods. It's easy to blame the volatility we are now seeing on the financial markets with the buyers' pause, but the slowdown actually started 6 months ago. There seems to be a condo project on every block, mostly being developed by undercapitalized, over-leveraged players. Vornado's sole exposure to the condo business is our 220 Central Park South project, which is in a class by itself. 
A word about the credit markets, which are becoming a tale of the haves and the have-nots. For sponsors such as Vornado, the credit markets are open at historically low rates. On the other side of the spectrum, for risk assets and less-established sponsors, the credit markets are clogged and choppy. Here's an example I'd like to share with you. Last week, we closed the $700 million, 5-year floating rate loan on 770 Broadway at LIBOR plus 1.75, which we swapped to fix at 2.56%. I think 2.56% fixed for what is actually a 4.5 years swap on a $700 million loan is a truly spectacular rate. And by the way, just for reference, that rate is a full 59 basis points better than the rate on a similar loan we've closed just 2 months ago. 
It's too early to tell what effect the recent volatility in the financial markets will have a leasing or on asset valuation. My guess is not all that much. We have been long overdue for a correction, and after all, a swarm in economic activity and volatility in the debt and equity markets seem a sure recipe for a continued easy money and low interest rates. 
I'll conclude with a listing of our priorities about what we're focusing on and what are proving important in our business. One, buttoning up and focusing on being strong and ready, both financially and every other way. And by the way, we are beginning to see a few interesting opportunities; two, recognizing the full potential of our vast Penn Plaza assets. Actually, Penn Plaza is a city within a city; and three, closing the gap between our stock price and the true value of our company. By the way, Green Street's NAV for Vornado is $125 a share. 
Thank you for listening. I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share",1276,"Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share last year, also a very strong 10.5% increase. The increase in our comparable FFO in 2015 versus the prior year was clouded by lower gains in 2015 from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund. Excluding this effect, our comparable FFO for the year would have increased 13 -- I'm sorry, 16.3%. Not surprisingly, our growth comes from our large and strong New York business. 
Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the full year was $5.48 per share compared to $4.83 per share for the prior year. Noncomparable FFO items aggregated $19.4 million [ph] of income for the fourth quarter compared to $13 million of income for the fourth quarter of last year. 2015 noncomparable items aggregated $123.7 million of income, consisting primarily of a $90 [ph] million reversal of an allowance on deferred tax assets of our taxable resubsidiaries and $46.4 million of FFO from the operations of 20 Broad and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, which we sold. Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on pages 37 and 38 of our annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed summary of noncomparable items. 
Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was $400.7 million, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 9.6%. Our full year comparable EBITDA was $1.533 billion, ahead of last year by 5.9%. Excluding the effect of our real estate fund, our full year comparable EBITDA increased by 8.9%. 
Our New York business produced $283.5 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by a strong $29.2 million or 11.5%. Comparable EBITDA for the New York business was $1.079 billion for the year or 12.2% ahead of 2014. The increases in comparable EBITDA for the quarter and the year were driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service, primarily 7 West 34th, 330 West 34th Street and the Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway; and acquisitions, primarily the St. Regis retail, 150 West 34th Street and the Center building in Long Island city. 
Our New York same-store results are historically industry leading and we expect to have same-store growth well over 5% in 2016, sequentially higher in the second half than in the first half. When thinking about our earnings in 2016, please keep in mind that we recognized $28 million of onetime income in 2015 from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to the early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel lease at 1650 medicine. While this income is included in our 2015 comparable results, it is not included in our 2015 same-store results. 
Our Washington business produced $79.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, flat to last year's fourth quarter. For the year, Washington's comparable EBITDA was $3.5 million behind last year, on target with our updated guidance. With respect to 2016, we expect that Washington's comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015, comprised of our core Washington business being flat to $4 million higher, offset by occupancy of our Skyland properties declining further, decrease in EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million and 1726 M and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A trophy office building, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. 
Now turning to capital markets. In November, we completed an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750 [ph] million. The facility is separate and in addition to our $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities and will be used for the specific purpose of funding the construction of our 220 Central Park South luxury condo tower. This facility matures in October 2018 with 2 1-year extension options to 2020. [ph] The interest rate is a tight LIBOR plus 115 basis points with a fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing, we drew $187.5 million. This facility, together with the in-place $915 [ph] million loan, provides funding for all of the cost of the development of 220 Central Park South. 
In December, we completed a $415 [ph] million financing of the St. Regis retail located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The loan matures in December 2020 with 2 1-year extension options. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.8% for the first 3 years, LIBOR plus 1.9% for years 4 and 5 and a LIBOR plus 2% during the extension periods. 
In December, we completed a $375 million refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue and 882,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.6%, which will swap for the term of the loan for a fixed rate of 3.15%. We'll realized net proceeds of approximately $49 million after repaying the existing 5.71%, $319 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in January 2016. 
Last week, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which will swap for 4.5 years for a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in March 2016. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $708.6 million, consisting primarily of the $515 [ph] million mort loan, which matures in December 2016, and $115 million property loan, which matures in June 2016. We are well aware working on these refinancings. Excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South project and including the capital market transactions completed in 2016, our consolidated debt metrics are debt-to-enterprise value of 34%; debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 6.2x; fixed rate debt accounted for 77% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4% and a weighted average term of 5.1; years, and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0% and a weighted average term of 5.8 years. 
Our share of 2016 debt maturities up [ph] partially on the entities are $736.4 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue; $161 million at the Warner building; and $138 million at One Park Avenue. We're also well along on working on these refinancings. Including our share of partially owned entities debt, excluding Toys R Us, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio goes to 7.5x from 6.2x for our consolidated debt. 
Okay. As we disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements, we recognized onetime tax reductions related to the implementation of a tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. These deductions and gains from sales transactions resulted in 100% of our 2015 common dividend being classified as long-term capital gains. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet. Our leverage is modest and our maturities are well staggered. The vast majority of our debt is conservatively-sized property level secured mortgages. We have a very high-quality portfolio of unencumbered properties. As of -- we have as of today $4.5 billion of liquidity comprised of $2 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.5 undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."

It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate mar",2759,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone. Before I jump into a review of our business for 2015, I want to step back and spend a few minutes talking about market conditions. It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate market in New York. In a nutshell, I would say that business has been and remain good. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan in 2015 was strong, 28.2 million square feet transacted, the third highest in a decade. At a 9.4% availability rate in Manhattan, the rate was 80 basis points lower at year-end 2015 than 2014. In 2015, 4.5 million square feet of space was absorbed in Manhattan, with Midtown accounting for some 75% of the positive absorption, 3.3 million square feet. We are now 6-plus years into this growth cycle with availability rates having come down by over 340 [ph] basis points from 12.8% to the current 9.4%. And during that time period, there was a total absorption of more than 20 million square feet of space in the market. 
Absorption and employment, of course, are directly linked. New York has been an amazing magnet for job growth. From the trough in 2009 August through year-end 2015, private sector employment in New York has gained over 600,000 jobs, over 4x the number of jobs lost in the recession and is now at an all-time record high. In our business, of course, we focus more closely on New York City's office-using employment number, which also has continued to expand, gaining 31,000 jobs in 2015. Since office-using employment bottomed in 2009, New York City has added over 200,000 office-using jobs, double the number of jobs lost, and again, the second all-time high. While the city's office of management and budget is projecting a lower rate of job growth in 2016 of about 60,000 private sector jobs, that still represents a very healthy growth rate of 1.7%. The city now has a highly diversified local economy with TAMI tenant fees, technology, advertising, media and information, as well as the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real estate, both driving strong job growth. As Steve would say, we are no longer a 1-trick financial services pony in New York. 
Let me now turn to our own portfolio. In 2015, in our New York office portfolio, we completed 2.3 million square feet of leased activity in 165 [ph] transactions with a very diverse mix of high-quality tenants across many business sectors. We achieved our highest ever average starting rents of just under $79 per square foot with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 22.8% GAAP and 19.1% cash. Importantly, 32% of our 2.3 million square feet of leasing, some 750,000 square feet, represented tenants new to New York or expanding in New York. Real expansion, real growth. Let me give you some of the names: IPG; the Interpublic group of companies; Facebook; AOL; United talent Agency; PJT Partners; Factset, PPG; Footlocker; Parts and Brinkerhoff; and GIC, the government of Singapore investment Corporation. 
As many of the brokerage firms have noted, in 2015, the FIRE sector reemerged as the top driver of leasing with nearly 1/3 of overall activity. That moved back to finance and the Baltic asset management and private equity firms has had a notable impact at the high end of the marketplace. In a $100-plus per square foot marketplace citywide in 2015, 138 leases were executed. We completed 28 of those leases, a 20% market share, for a total, as Steve had mentioned, of 400 -- 544,000 square feet, which was 25% of our total leasing activity. Think about it. With less than a 5% market share, we did 20% of the triple-digit deals in the market and more than any other landlord, spread in 6 of our trophy buildings: 650 Madison Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 350 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, 640 Fifth Avenue and 770 Broadway, all at average starting rents of $108 per square foot. This certainly speaks to the quality of our asset. 
I might also add that while historically, the $100 plus per square foot marketplace had been limited to small space users, last year, we completed 2 of the 4 largest triple-digit leases in the city: with a private equity firm at 888 Seventh Avenue for 93,000 square feet; and the other with a tech company at 770 Broadway for 80,000 square feet. 
Let me now quickly turn to the fourth quarter. We completed over 600,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter at average starting rents of $75 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 25.7% GAAP and 22.4% cash. Our year-end occupancy was 96.3%. We remain basically full. 
A couple of highlights for the quarter. In Penn Plaza, at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed an 82,000 square-foot lease with structured tone, which will join this building diverse tenant roster of Footlocker, Deutsche advertising, Yodle and New York and Company. With this deal, the building is now 90% leased up. We actually moved Structured Tone, our tenant at 770 Broadway, to 330 West 34th Street to free up to lease an additional floor in 770 Broadway to AOL, which is now owned by Verizon and in a growth mode. AOL now occupies a total of 308,000 square feet in 770 Broadway. At 100 West 34th Street, the office portion of the Manhattan Mall, we took back a floor from Rocket Fuel, which was looking to downsize, and immediately leased the space to IPG, which now occupies a total of 607,000 square feet in the building for its ad groups media brands, FCB and initiative. We also entered into important renewal leases with Fidelity Investments at 640 Fifth Avenue for 41,000 square feet and a law firm at 999 Third Avenue for 65,000 square feet. And finally, a renewal expansion with United Talent Agency at 888 Seventh Avenue for 43,000 square feet. 
Our activity at the start of 2016 remains strong. At 770, just last week, we signed an 80,000 square-foot expansion with Facebook, which has now grown to 355,000 square feet at 770 from its initial occupancy of 98,000 square feet in May 2013. We have a strong leasing pipeline of 1,350,000 square feet. This includes over 550,000 square feet in active lease documentation and another 800,000 square feet of leases in advanced discussions. 
With a highly-diversified multitenant portfolio, our lease expirations for the balance of 2016 are a modest 800,000 square feet, our normal run rate. And as we look out to 2017 and 2018, the explorations are around 1 million square feet a year with no 1 tenant representing more than 150,000 square feet. 
Over the last 3 years, we have completed a string of major building redevelopment, repositioning 7 buildings, a total of 6.4 million square feet. Our portfolio is in great shape. We transformed both 7 West 34th Street, bringing in Amazon to lease virtually the entire building, and 330 West 34th Street into 1.2 million square feet of creative class space. With its full block lobby, midblock jewel box atrium and new curtain wall, 280 Park Avenue with JP Morgan Chase as our direct next-door neighbor, is now one of the best buildings in Park Avenue, attracting best-in-class boutiques boutique financial firms. At 1290 Avenue of the Americas and at 330 Madison Avenue, we executed dramatic building renovations and landed Neuberger Berman at 1290 and Guggenheim Partners at 330 as the building's signature tenant. And we are now in the final stages of completing our program at 90 Park Avenue, attracting both traditional financial service firms as well as the creative type. We will be happy to take you on a tour of our portfolio to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the dramatic public spaces. Call Cathy. My development and leasing teams are enormously monthly proud of what we have accomplished and enjoy showing off our assets. 
With the completion of these renovation program, you may be asking yourselves, so what's next? Of course, there is Penn Plaza. This is the submarket, whose time has now come. Last month, Governor Cuomo unveiled an ambitious infrastructure plan for New York State, including an array of down state transportation projects: A new cross Hudson rail tunnel, an addition of a third track to a portion of the Long Island railroad; a train to La Guardia airport and more. It's an impressive area of projects. And most importantly, as the governor stated, Penn Station, and I'm now quoting, ""Penn Station will be the nexus for all days increased capacity, doubling the traffic through Penn Station over the next 15 years."" That is very, very good news for a 9 million square feet of holdings in Penn Plaza. 
While our Penn Plaza assets have, for the better part of 20 years, been fully leased, rents remain substantially below what we believe these buildings can achieve, given their unmatched access transportation and their locations in the center of Manhattan's new website. We see a tremendous opportunity to reposition these assets, in line with what we have done elsewhere in the city. Consider for a moment just 1 Penn and 2 Penn Plaza, 2 buildings that sit directly on top of and have access to Penn Station without ever stepping outside. These are buildings that represent a significant value creation opportunity. Our team continues to advance plan to turn these 2 buildings into a massive 4.2 million square foot Penn Plaza complex, fully modernized with shared amenity spaces integrated both above and below ground. When you consider our other development opportunities in the district, it's easy to see why Steve described Penn Plaza as the big kahuna. 
For a glimpse into the future of the area, be sure to stop in for a bite at the new Pennzy. It's a food hall we recently created in 2 Penn Plaza at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Spend a few minutes enjoying a meal and a cocktail, or wait until the weather gets a bit warmer and we open up the rolltop garage doors onto Plaza33. As you know, last year, we implemented a temporary closure of 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue to create a public amenity called Plaza33. The Plaza earned rave reviews from the press, elected officials and the local community. We continue to work with the city and the local community board and are hopeful that Plaza 33 will return later this year as a permanent year-round feature. I hope you will stop by. 
Another answer to the question of what's next is our growing beachhead in the West Chelsea district. At 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street and 512 West 22nd Street right on the High Line, we have partnered to develop ground up, 2 new boutique office building. Also at 260 Eleventh Avenue, we have the opportunity to totally redevelop and expand the asset acquired in an off-market transaction. When you consider where these assets are located in the quality of the architecture, you will see that these buildings will be the trophy asset of the future. 
Let me now turn to our important Manhattan street retail portfolio, where as you know, in 2015, we signed the 3 largest leases in the market, all on Fifth Avenue: A 64,000 square-foot flagship with Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue; and 2 leases with Swatch for its luxury brands; and for Harry Winston at the St. Regis retail. The aggregate starting rents for these leases are $70 million. Think about it. The rent coming out of these 3 retail leases
[Audio Gap]
square foot office building. We delivered possession of the 640 space to Victoria's Secret on February 1, and both Swatch spaces have now been delivered. Revenue recognition on a GAAP basis has now commenced. In total, for the year 2015, we completed 20 retail leases with positive mark-to-markets at 99% GAAP, a 2 multiple; and 149% cash, a 2.5 multiple. We have good activity on our remaining spaces at 1535 as well as the 3200 square foot store we carved out at 640 with 25 feet of frontage. 
I'll touch only briefly on theMART in River North in Chicago, since I spent quite a bit of time on the transformation of this iconic asset on our last call. For the year, we leased more than 750,000 square feet in 86 transactions, including headquarters relocations for ConAgra Foods and Allstate and expansions by PayPal, Yelp and the prominent technology incubator, 1871, all at average positive mark-to-markets of 25.3% GAAP and 20.5% cash. This monumental 3.6 million square-foot asset is 98.5% leased. We are well into our 40-plus million dollar redevelopment program to add state-of-the-art amenities to theMART, a grand stair with Stadium seating for our tenants to congregate, including the presentation venue, and bringing new life to the first 2 floors of the building as well as trendsetting food options and a reimagined food hall. We could not be happier with the performance of this asset. 
On to San Francisco. 2015 was a relatively quiet leasing year for us in San Francisco, where our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California Street property is an iconic part of the Skyline. After a very active 2013 and 2014, when we leased over 900,000 square feet of the property, in 2015, we leased a total of 98,000 square feet at average starting rents in excess of $83 per square foot and at positive cash mark-to-markets of 34.8%. While the tower at 555 California is fully leased at an occupancy rate of 98.4%, in the fourth quarter, Bank of America, as expected, vacated the old banking hall at 345 Montgomery Street as well as the space it occupied in the adjacent 315 Montgomery Street building, a total of about 200,000 square feet. We are currently prepping the space with exposed brick walls and open plan space for today's creative class of tenants and introduce the space for the marketplace with a broker event in the building just last week. We remain very constructive on the San Francisco market. 
Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same-store numbers for the New York business for 2015 were positive 2.4% GAAP and 1.3% cash. And for the fourth quarter, the same-store numbers were positive 1.4% GAAP and negative 4.4% cash. As we have said over the course of the year, these numbers are not reflective of the real growth in operating results for the New York division. 
I want to pause here and minute and talk about the negative same-store numbers for the fourth quarter. This is really important and I want to go over these numbers carefully. In the fourth quarter of 2015, just in our New York office business, there was a 10% swing in the difference between our capital expenditure our cash same-store numbers. GAAP same-store for the office business was a positive 3.7% and cash same-store was a negative 6.1%. This is an unusual occurrence, which is attributable to the free rent periods on the extraordinary amount of leasing that we completed in 2014, some 4.2 million square feet. 
Regarding the 2015 GAAP same-store results, as I've said in our previous calls, the tepid growth numbers reflected a dip in occupancy attributable to the e redevelopment of 90 Park Avenue as well as the downtime in connection with the redevelopment of the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue for Victoria's Secret and the retail space we took back from Crate & Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. 2015's real growth came from placing our out-of-service properties, 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway, back into service, which contributed a total of $47 million of EBITDA growth not reflected in our same-store results. And importantly, as Steve Theriot said earlier, our New York same-store results historically have been industry-leading and we fully expect same-store growth in our New York business to be back to well over 5% in 2016. 
Let me conclude. It was a strong year in New York for both the market and Vornado, and we believe we are well-positioned to capture more than our fair share of leasing activity. With a diverse employer base and a large talent pool, there is no place where we would rather be. And we're confident that the quality and location of our buildings, our team and our relationships in the marketplace will enable us to outperform the marketplace in any environment in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."
312648,318294802,934580,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 201",1070,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 2014 to over 68,000 new jobs in 2015. Importantly, 48% of this growth was in office using sectors with 32,900 new jobs. The passage of the 2-year federal budget has had a broad stabilizing effect on the local economy. And on the ground, the green shoots are sprouting a bit. We saw a pickup in leasing activity and tours throughout 2015. Specifically, in our Washington portfolio, as we expected, our 2015 comparable EBITDA was down about $3.5 million from 2014. As Steve Theriot said earlier, in 2016, we expect EBITDA from our core Washington business will be flat to $4 million higher than 2015. However, that growth will be offset by 2 items: First, we expect occupancy of our Skyline properties to decline further, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million; second, we will be vacating and taking 1726 M and 1150 17th Street out of service, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. This spring, we will demolish these 2 obsolete buildings in preparation for the development in the future of a new state-of-the-art trophy office building, 1700 M, in the heart of the Central Business District. So summing it all up, we expect that Washington's 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me take a minute now to review our 2015 results. In 2015, we leased a lot of space, over 2.1 million square feet in 216 deals at an initial average cash rent of $40.20 per square foot. About 1/3 of our 2015 leases were new and expanding tenants, and the other 2/3 were renewals. We ended the year with office occupancy of 82.1%, an increase of 140 basis points over year-end 2014. Skyline sell to 15.1% occupancy by year-end, down 340 basis points from 2014, an obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our office occupancy at year-end was 89.9%, an improvement of 250 basis points over 2014. Our Crystal City occupancy at year-end was 89.5%, an improvement of 430 basis points over 2014. On the residential side, we owned 2,400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with a year-end occupancy of 96.1%. 
Focusing specifically on the fourth quarter for a moment, we leased 450,000 square feet, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 0.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.7%, a result we are pleased with, given the competition that exists for every lease. Our fourth quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 11.5% of initial rents or $5.06 per square foot per annum, trending lower than the prior quarters in 2015. 
Now let's turn specifically to Crystal City and Pentagon City. In 2015, we executed 1.1 million square feet of office leases in Crystal City. Crystal City is starting to gain traction, as noted in several local brokerage reports. JLL cited that Crystal City led all other submarkets in the region in net absorption last year. Those deals were predominantly done by us. Cushman & Wakefield's recent market presentation referenced Crystal City's comeback and noted that Crystal City is doing what it takes to win big deals with 1.3 million square feet leased in 2015. Notably, in Q4, we executed a 35,000 square-foot lease with an insurance company, Dominion National at 251 18th Street. And at the same building, we recently completed a 53,000 square-foot lease with Kumonix, an international development company. This 300,000 square-foot building, which was completely vacated by BRAC tenants, is now 95% leased. Also in Crystal City, 2221 South Clark Street, another office building previously vacated by defense agencies, has just reopened as WeWork's first location in Northern Virginia. In addition to our partnership with WeWork downtown in our Dupont Circle building, we now together converted this building into 216 collaborative living, community-style apartments as well as 2 floors of WeWork co-working office space. The office portion opened on February 1. It looks great and it's already 60% [ph] occupied. The residential units will be opened in the spring. We're excited to add this important layer to the Crystal City fabric and look forward to welcoming fresh new faces our community. 
Overall, we've now resolved or have pending about 74% of the original 2.4 million square feet of space vacated by BRAC tenants. We have 630,000 square feet left to resolve and 412,000 square feet of that is in Skyline. In Crystal City, we have taken care of close to 90% or 1.3 million square feet of the original 1.4 million square feet of the BRAC space. We replaced BRAC tenants with a diverse array of associations, professional services and tech innovators, steadily changing the complexion and the demographics in Crystal City. 
We continue to change the street-level experience as well. Just last week, Sweetgreen, a local millennial favorite, opened its doors on Crystal Drive. Sweetgreen, Taylor Gourmet and Earth Treks, a new indoor climbing gym, are just a few of the new retailers, who are bringing a fresh flavor of destination food and activity to Crystal City. We're also changing the physical experience. We recently received approval from Arlington County to begin redeveloping the building that will be vacated by the U.S. Marshals at the end of this year. Located on Crystal Drive at the Metro, the newly rebranded 1770 Crystal Drive will be fully repositioned with a new skin, new lobby, new systems, new retail and a top floor conference center for delivery in early 2018. The building will be surrounded by restaurants and entertainment, adding to the street vitality. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we just kicked off pre-leasing on our new 699-unit apartment project, the Bartlett. Located directly atop the new Whole Foods and overlooking the Washington Monument, this 23-story building is already a Skyline maker. We officially opened in June and are eager to offer the best new amenity package in town to our residents. We continue to be excited about the additional value we can deliver in our D.C. portfolio, value that will come from leasing of our existing vacancy, finishing our new residential offerings and offerings that are under construction, and building out our development pipeline. 
I want to thank you all, and I'd like to the turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The second thing is that we exited the retail, the non-Manhattan retail business for a variety of reasons. We noted several years ago a secular -- not a cyclical, a secular change in retailing patterns. We acted upon that. We exited the mall business, entirely swamping many of the assets for what we thought were better assets. But really, the -- and then what we decided, we did not want to sell the strip retail business, the Northeast business, which by the way, had the Bergen Mall in it and 2 Puerto Rican malls in it, and so it was sort of a little bit of a hybrid. We thought that it was a grand business and we thought that the right move was to deconglomerate the business and have a very focused, laser-focused management on a smaller business. We see that the business with a great balance sheet, enough cash to succeed at a very, very engaged board and we couldn't it be more pleased, as I said. The stock price is appropriate. Obviously, it could be a little bit higher, but it's appropriate, nowhere near the discount of Vornado and we think it has a great future. So that is a very, very interesting template. There's been speculation about that we might do a similar thing with Washington. We're up to our eyeballs in considering that. So that is not -- that's something that is absolutely on the table and we are absolutely considering. We think that will -- interestingly enough, if you take our Washington business, and I also did say at the beginning of my remarks that Washington is in a slow recovery being tracked down by Skyline, and we do believe that and our numbers show it, by the way. If you look at Washington as a separate segment, which has been beaten up admittedly, and you project now a 4-, 5-, 6-year growth back to normalcy, it is a very high growth, very interesting business."

The other one is 2.5 million, 2.6 million, 2.7 million square feet. So in total, they are really -- they're sort of like kissing cousins and they comprise four point one two million square feet in total. So it's massive, number one. Number two is they sit right on top of the busiest train station in North America, so that's unbelievable. There are no other buildings that share that honor, so to speak. And number three is that they are right in the center, right at the bull's eye of what we call and the marketplace call the new West Side. So it's a tremendous opportunity. Now having said that, one of the real opportunities is that the buildings are sufficiently large so that the owner of the building -- and they are in 1 ownership, so there's a lot of benefits that there. We can move tenants back and forth between the 2 buildings. If a tenant needs overflow space or expansion space and we don't have it in the building that they are in, we can move -- we can fit that up in the adjacent building, although that's interesting because the buildings historically are always full. The second thing is we can afford to put an amenity complex into those 4-plus million square foot buildings that are not economic, even for half a million or 1 million foot square-foot building, which are also larger buildings. And the population of those buildings that will be coursing through the spaces is also enormous. And we can put food offerings and even delivery of food into the complex. So there's a lot of different ideas that we have, many of which are being taken from what the tech industry is doing on their big huge campuses. Now in terms of what they're going to cost, they are both going to be co-mingled with improvements, which will affect Penn Station and the neighborhood. Now what I mean by that is we are confident that we will -- that the 33rd Street will be closed. And that gives a great opportunity in and both of the building front on 33rd Street to create entrances into the station, to create skylights and light into the stations and what have you. So it's very hard -- which I've already said, we're going to participate in, or at least we're going to participate in this RFP with all of enthusiastically and in a huge way. So it's hard to separate them. Now Two Penn, we've already said publicly that our plans are to completely skin the building. We'll take the ski of the building off and replace it with a new skin, which will have aesthetic consequences, of course, but more importantly than that, it will allow what our old-fashioned hunched windows to grow to be almost, not quite, but almost floor-to-ceiling windows, which have large breadth and make the building looked like it was built recently, which will enormously increase the market value of the building. This can also involve -- the entrance on Seventh Avenue to Penn Station, which is directly under our building, which is the main entrance to Penn Station. So there's lots of things going on here, which are enormously exciting. The Penn, the One Penn building will be more like in costs a conventional transformation and upgrade that we would to, more expensive because it's twice the size. The Two Penn will be much more expensive, because it involves a totally rescanning. So it's too early, it's premature to put a number on that, but I can tell you that we are unbelievably excited about the opportunity."

So the first thing is we see no deterioration in the New York Office business. That's step one. What's going to happen 9 months or a year from now, that's another question, and we see no basis upon which to believe that 9 months or a year from now, the New York Office business will be any different than it is today. So that's step one. I mean, obviously, if there's a deterioration in the economy, all bets are off, okay? So that's step 1. Step 2 is that New York benefits from an enormously diverse business community. And there are, at any given time, certain sectors which are expanding and certain sectors are contracting. We see no signs that people like Amazon and Facebook or their ilk are doing anything other than full steam ahead and expanding aggressively. So a lot of what happens to the individual companies is a function of the mix of their assets and to which segment of the office market they cater to.

We do see that there are fewer bidders than at the historical top of the market, maybe whatever that was a year ago or whatever. And so we think that the big thing is that, and I sort of said this in my remarks, this swoon, I'll call it swoon sworn for the moment for lack of a better word, and the volatility in the capital markets, I believe, and most commentators believe, will cause an extension of below interest rate, easy mone- environment that we have found ourselves in for years and years now. And it's very hard to understand how, with the treasury at 1.8 today, that cap rates can go above go above 4.5, let's say, the into the 5s and 6s. So the interest rate environment and the wall of liquidity, which still exists, is an anchor on keeping pricing firm. The next part of it is that it's not random that we and our colleagues operate in New York City, which we consider to be the magnet for both domestic and international capital to invest in real estate. And also, it's when -- history has shown that when there is volatility in the capital markets, after the initial jitters are over, this real estate becomes an extraordinarily important store of value and has over decades and decades.

What we did there was it's a 1.1 million square-foot building, which has extraordinary tenants. By the way, it's a mature building, which is my way of seeing it's -- basically, it's a department store, so it has enormous wall place, high ceilings, great windows. It's a terrific building and a terrific spot. Although it is not anywhere -- it is not, by any stretch, a new steel and glass building. Anyway, so we financed it, we refinanced the 350-odd [ph] million dollar loan in the fives [ph] for $700 million. And we did it on a floating-rate basis, and they floated at LIBOR 1.75. And then we swapped the floating rate to fixed. So we have an extensive capital markets team here and we analyzed every different option in terms of both duration of loan and floating fixed, et cetera. And so we basically have borrowed a -- made it a 5-year fixed loan. It's actually technically a 4.5-year fixed, which is another old scale. We swapped it for 4.5 years and the rate is 2.56. Now if that's an extraordinary rate for a high-quality building, it's really hard to see how cap rates rise with that kind of financing available. In fact, this may sound crazy to you, cap rates may well decline a little bit. So there you have it."

The building has a very hefty loan on it, so it's basically almost a -- let me leave it that way, it has a very hefty loan. So the partners have been exploring options, which center around the concept that the land unencumbered by building is worth more than the existing assets that are on the building on the land.

I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks are a little long, but be assured we will leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
Yesterday, we reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.27 per share, 10.4% better than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our full comparable -- our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, 10.5% better than 2014. If we were to exclude our real estate fund, the increase over 2014 would have been 16.3%.  Our earnings growth was driven by our flagship New York business, and as David will cover shortly, our New York business will continue to produce strong growth in 2015. 
Company-wide, in 2015, we leased 5,381,000 square feet in 483 transactions with overall positive mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 12% cash. In New York, we leased 2,276,000 square feet for the year and 610,000 square feet for the fourth quarter at positive GAAP mark-to-markets of 22.8% for the year and an even higher 25.7% for the fourth quarter. These are great numbers. Mitchell and David will give you details of their businesses shortly. Washington is now a tale of slow recovery  being dragged down by Skyline. 
With respect to Penn Plaza, we are delighted that Governor Cuomo has shined a bright light on the importance of Penn Station as New York City's busiest transportation hub and the crying need for improvement. Vornado will be a full participant in this process. The Penn Plaza District, where we are the dominant owner with 9 million square feet, is a great opportunity for us. We are knee-deep in planning multiple projects to transform and enhance our vast Penn Plaza holdings. We are the industry leader in capital programs to reposition and upgrade office and retail assets so as to achieve their full potential. As David will tell you, next up is our grand plan to upgrade, modernize and transform One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza into an integrated 4.2 million square-foot complex sitting directly on top of Penn Station in the center of what has become New York's new West Side. The goal here is to achieve market rents as much as 50% higher than today's rents. 
Almost a year ago, in my letter to shareholders and each -- and in each of our last 3 quarterly calls, I stated that the easy money has been made for this cycle, asset prices are high, well past the 2007 peak. It's a better time to sell than to invest. And most importantly, now is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. To be honest, I didn't expect to be so right so quickly. With many sectors of the economy decelerating, we are experiencing a period of high volatility in both the credit markets and the equity markets. This will, of course, have some effect on the real estate market. So we have been preparing for all this for whatever is to come. Vornado is buttoned up and ready. Our New York properties are very well leased; we are basically full. Our income stream is diversified, coming from over 1,200 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Our top 10 tenants account for only 13.2% of revenue. It is a testament to the quality of our assets and our leasing machine that Victoria's Secret chose, in a very competitive makeover, to locate their 64,000 square-foot Fifth Avenue flagship with us. Same for Facebook, Amazon, Foot Locker and Neuberger Berman and on and on, you get the picture. 
In this environment, cash is king. Today, we have $4.5 million of immediate -- $4.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and our fully undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. On top of that, we have over $13 billion of highest-quality unencumbered properties. 
Last year in my annual letter to shareholders, on Page 10 if you would like to reread it, I laid out our debt philosophy. Vornado enjoys access to the 4 corners of the capital markets. We prefer secured debt that is recourse solely to a single property rather than unsecured corporate debt that bears the full faith and credit of the issuer, sort of like a personal guaranty. It is interesting to note that today, secured debt for a sponsor of the standing -- of our standing is both readily available and surprisingly cheaper than the unsecured full faith and credit-type debt. The unsecured and CMBS debt markets are getting a little jumpy. Vornado today has only $850 million of unsecured debt in 2 issues, maturing 4 and 7 years out. 
Vornado is focused and simplified and ready for battle, having sold, spun or pruned over $8.7 billion of assets. True to our word, we have sold much more than we have acquired. Acquisitions have been limited to strategic New York retail properties and creative class value-added office projects. We have pushed the way from acquisitions which were off the fairway, nonstrategic, or most importantly, overpriced. Importantly, we have also significantly upgraded the mix and quality of our assets. For example, trading 1740 Broadway, B office building for the St. Regis retail, a 66 UN Plaza for 655 Fifth Avenue retail with Ferragamo store, the Green Acres B+ mall for the retail block at 666 Fifth Avenue and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue for Old Navy on 34th street. 
Three years ago, anticipating secular change, note the current softness in retail and recognizing that with only a handful of malls, we were in no man's land. We decided to exit all non-Manhattan retail. I believe this decision will look better and better and better as each year goes by. 
A word about our shopping center spin, Urban Edge Properties. Celebrating its first anniversary, we couldn't be more delighted with its performance. We created UE by ceding it with our unique, high variant, northeastern shopping center assets. And with our management and staff, we recruited Jeff Olson, a best-in-class CEO, and [indiscernible] it with a strong balance sheet supported by an experienced and engaged board. Urban Edge is producing the exact result we had expected. And investors, the final report card, are rewarding UE with an appropriate stock price, which, by the way, has held rock solid in the recent months of carnage. And think about it, if the UE assets were still bundled inside Vornado, they probably would be valued at a big discount just like Vornado is. Given the success of UE, the concept of labor -- laser-focused smaller entities may well be a template for the future. 
Our 220 Central Park South supertall residential condominium tower is also buttoned up. It is now 260 feet vertical and visible from Central Park. It will rise at the rate of 1 floor per week. We have dedicated super-low interest rate financing in place, sufficient to fund the entire project. We are over 50% under contract at record-setting pricing, which covers our cost. We will deliver in 2018, and trust me, there will be at least 2 more up-and-down cycles before then. That's sort of a joke. 
As asset values have risen over the cycle, we have pulled back from making loans, especially mezzanine loans. We now have only a couple of small loans left on our books. 
Now if I may, a few words about the New York real estate markets. We see no real hiccups so far in the Class A office market. Vornado's office business continues to perform at very high levels. We do anticipate that decision-makers will take note of the financial volatility and pause, slow down and rethink a little. Of course, we are constantly looking over our shoulders; that's our job. But business continues to be great, so far, so good. David and Mitchell will discuss the health of their markets with you in a moment. My personal favorite, as David will tell you, is that a full 25% of Vornado's New York leasing in 2015 was at rents over $100 per foot. Pretty amazing. I was going to say in a move over more, but my team wouldn't let me say it. So I didn't say it. 
Nationwide, retail sales are soft and shopping center traffic has been declining quarter-over-quarter. In Manhattan, as I've said before, momentum investors have driven retail asset prices too high. Landlord asking rents are also too high, exceeding retailer's willingness and ability to pay. Trust me, we are the biggest player in this market by far, and we are in the business of being realistic in terms of pricing and making deals. And at our bases, we sure can. 
Hotels are soft. Just look at the hotel stocks, which are off 1/3 to 1/2. In my mind, the New York hotel industry is the victim of gross cyclical oversupply, even more than the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. New York has added 25,000 rooms in 2010 to a base of 82,000 rooms and -- with 18,000 more rooms under construction, too much supply. And then, of course, there is Airbnb, sort of like what e-shopping is to brick-and-mortar retailing. Interestingly, while people say that the strong dollar is causing a decline in tourism, the numbers show that both domestic and international tourism are holding up just fine. Vornado has a very limited exposure to the hotel market, principally, the Hotel Pennsylvania, which is really a parking lot. 
The for-sale condo business has dramatically slowed at all price points and in all neighborhoods. It's easy to blame the volatility we are now seeing on the financial markets for the buyers' pause, but the slowdown actually started 6 months ago. There seems to be a condo project on every block, most being developed by undercapitalized, over-leveraged players. Vornado's sole exposure to the condo business is our 220 Central Park South project, which is in a class by itself. 
A word about the credit markets, which are becoming a tale of the haves and the have-nots. For sponsors such as Vornado, the credit markets are open at historically low rates. On the other side of the spectrum, for risk assets and less-established sponsors, the credit markets are clogged and choppy. Here's an example I'd like to share with you. Last week, we closed the $700 million, 5-year floating rate loan on 770 Broadway at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which we swapped to fixed at 2.56%. I think 2.56% fixed for what is actually a 4.5 year swap on a $700 million loan is a truly spectacular rate. And by the way, just for a reference, that rate is a full 59 basis points better than the rate on a similar loan we closed just 2 months ago. 
It's too early to tell what effect the recent volatility in the financial markets will have on leasing or on asset valuation. My guess is not all that much. We have been long overdue for a correction, and after all, a swoon in economic activity and volatility in the debt and equity markets seem a sure recipe for continued easy money and low interest rates. 
I'll conclude with a listing of our priorities what we're focusing on and what are proving important in our business. One, buttoning up and focusing on being strong and ready, both financially and in every other way. And by the way, we are beginning to see a few interesting opportunities; two, recognizing the full potential of our vast Penn Plaza assets. Actually, Penn Plaza is a city within a city; and three, closing the gap between our stock price and the true value of our company. By the way, Green Street's NAV for Vornado is $125 a share. 
Thank you for listening. I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share",1269,"Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share last year, also a very strong 10.5% increase. The increase in our comparable FFO in 2015 versus the prior year was clouded by lower gains in 2015 from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund. Excluding this effect, our comparable FFO for the year would have increased 13 -- I'm sorry, 16.3%. Not surprisingly, our growth comes from our large and strong New York business. 
Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the full year was $5.48 per share compared to $4.83 per share for the prior year. Noncomparable FFO items aggregated $19.4 million of income for the fourth quarter compared to $13 million of income for the fourth quarter of last year. 2015 noncomparable items aggregated $123.7 million of income, consisting primarily of a $90 million reversal of an allowance on deferred tax assets of our taxable resubsidiaries and $46.4 million of FFO from the operations of 20 Broad and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, which we sold. Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on pages 37 and 38 of our annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed summary of noncomparable items. 
Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was $400.7 million, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 9.6%. Our full year comparable EBITDA was $1.533 billion, ahead of last year by 5.9%. Excluding the effect of our real estate fund, our full year comparable EBITDA increased by 8.9%. 
Our New York business produced $283.5 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by a strong $29.2 million or 11.5%. Comparable EBITDA for the New York business was $1.079 billion for the year or 12.2% ahead of 2014. The increases in comparable EBITDA for the quarter and the year were driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service, primarily 7 West 34th, 330 West 34th Street and the Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway; and acquisitions, primarily the St. Regis retail, 150 West 34th Street and the Center building in Long Island city. 
Our New York same-store results are historically industry leading, and we expect to have same-store growth well over 5% in 2016, sequentially higher in the second half than in the first half. When thinking about our earnings in 2016, please keep in mind that we recognized $28 million of onetime income in 2015 from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to the early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel lease at 1650 Madison. While this income is included in our 2015 comparable results, it is not included in our 2015 same-store results. 
Our Washington business produced $79.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, flat to last year's fourth quarter. For the year, Washington's comparable EBITDA was $3.5 million behind last year, on target with our updated guidance. With respect to 2016, we expect that Washington's comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015, comprised of our core Washington business being flat to $4 million higher, offset by occupancy of our Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million and 1726 M and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A trophy office building, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. 
Now turning to capital markets. In November, we completed an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750 million. The facility is separate and an addition to our $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities and will be used for the specific purpose of funding the construction of our 220 Central Park South luxury condo tower. This facility matures in October 2018 with 2 1-year extension options to 2020. The interest rate is a tight LIBOR plus 115 basis points with a fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing, we draw -- we drew $187.5 million. This facility, together with the in-place $950 million loan, provides funding for all of the cost of the development of 220 Central Park South. 
In December, we completed a $450 million financing of the St. Regis retail located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The loan matures in December 2020 with 2 1-year extension options. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.8% for the first 3 years, LIBOR plus 1.9% for years 4 and 5 and LIBOR plus 2% during the extension periods. 
In December, we completed a $375 million refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, an 882,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.6%, which will swap for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 3.15%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $49 million after repaying the existing 5.71%, $319 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in January 2016. 
Last week, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which will swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in March 2016. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $708.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million mort loan, which matures in December 2016, and $115 million Bowen property loan, which matures in June 2016. We are well along working on these refinancings. Excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South project and including the capital market transactions completed in 2016, our consolidated debt metrics are debt-to-enterprise value of 34%; debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 6.2x; fixed rate debt accounted for 77% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0% and a weighted average term of 5.8 years. 
Our share of 2016 debt maturities of partially owned entities are $736.4 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue; $161 million at the Warner Building; and $138 million at One Park Avenue. We're also well along on working on these refinancings. Including our share of partially owned entities' debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio goes to 7.5x from 6.2x for our consolidated debt. 
Okay. As we disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements, we recognized onetime tax deductions related to the implementation of the tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. These deductions and gains from sales transactions resulted in 100% of our 2015 common dividend being classified as long-term capital gains. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet. Our leverage is modest, and our maturities are well staggered. The vast majority of our debt is conservatively sized property-level secured mortgages. We have a very high-quality portfolio of unencumbered properties. As of -- we have, as of today, $4.5 billion of liquidity comprised of $2 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.5 undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294802,934766,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone.

It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate mar",2760,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone. Before I jump into a review of our business for 2015, I want to step back and spend a few minutes talking about market conditions. It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate market in New York. In a nutshell, I would say that business has been and remains good. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan in 2015 was strong, 28.2 million square feet transacted, the third highest in a decade. At a 9.4% availability rate in Manhattan, the rate was 80 basis points lower at year-end 2015 than 2014. In 2015, 4.5 million square feet of space was absorbed in Manhattan, with Midtown accounting for some 75% of the positive absorption, 3.3 million square feet. We are now 6-plus years into this growth cycle with availability rates having come down by over 340 basis points from 12.8% to the current 9.4%. And during that time period, there was a total absorption of more than 20 million square feet of space in the market. 
Absorption and employment, of course, are directly linked. New York has been an amazing magnet for job growth. From the trough in 2009 August through year-end 2015, private sector employment in New York has gained over 600,000 jobs, over 4x the number of jobs lost in the recession and is now at an all-time record high. In our business, of course, we focus more closely on New York City's office-using employment number, which also has continued to expand, gaining 31,000 jobs in 2015. Since office-using employment bottomed in 2009, New York City has added over 200,000 office-using jobs, double the number of jobs lost, and again, is at an all-time high. While the city's office of management and budget is projecting a lower rate of job growth in 2016 of about 60,000 private sector jobs, that still represents a very healthy growth rate of 1.7%. The city now has a highly diversified local economy with TAMI tenant fees, technology, advertising, media and information as well as the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real estate, both driving its strong job growth. As Steve would say, we are no longer a 1-trick financial services pony in New York. 
Let me now turn to our own portfolio. In 2015, in our New York office portfolio, we completed 2.3 million square feet of leasing activity in 165 transactions with a very diverse mix of high-quality tenants across many business sectors. We achieved our highest ever average starting rents of just under $79 per square foot, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 22.8% GAAP and 19.1% cash. Importantly, 32% of our 2.3 million square feet of leasing, some 750,000 square feet, represented tenants new to New York or expanding in New York. Real expansion, real growth. Let me give you some of the names: IPG; the Interpublic Group of companies; Facebook; AOL; United talent Agency; PJT Partners; Factset, PPG; Foot Locker; Parsons Brinckerhoff; and GIC, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. 
As many of the brokerage firms have noted, in 2015, the FIRE sector reemerged as the top driver of leasing with nearly 1/3 of overall activity. That move back to finance and the boutique asset management and private equity firms has had a notable impact at the high end of the marketplace. In a $100-plus per square foot marketplace, citywide in 2015, 138 leases were executed. We completed 28 of those leases, a 20% market share, for a total, as Steve had mentioned, of 400 -- 544,000 square feet, which was 25% of our total leasing activity. Think about it. With less than a 5% market share, we did 20% of the triple-digit deals in the market and more than any other landlord, spread in 6 of our trophy buildings: 650 Madison Avenue; 888 Seventh Avenue; 350 Park Avenue; 280 Park Avenue; 640 Fifth Avenue; and 770 Broadway, all at average starting rents of $108 per square foot. This certainly speaks to the quality of our assets. 
I might also add that while historically, the $100- plus per square foot marketplace had been limited to small space users, last year, we completed 2 of the 4 largest triple-digit leases in the city: one, with a private equity firm at 888 Seventh Avenue for 93,000 square feet; and the other with a tech company at 770 Broadway for 80,000 square feet. 
Let me now quickly turn to the fourth quarter. We completed over 600,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter at average starting rents of $75 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 25.7% GAAP and 22.4% cash. Our year-end occupancy was 96.3%. We remain basically full. 
A couple of highlights for the quarter. In Penn Plaza, at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed an 82,000 square-foot lease with Structure Tone, which will join this building's diverse tenant roster of Foot Locker, Deutsch Advertising, Yodle and New York & Company. With this deal, the building is now 90% leased up. We actually moved Structure Tone, our tenant at 770 Broadway, to 330 West 34th Street to free up to lease an additional floor in 770 Broadway to AOL, which is now owned by Verizon and in a growth mode. AOL now occupies a total of 308,000 square feet in 770 Broadway. At 100 West 33rd Street, the office portion of the Manhattan Mall, we took back a floor from Rocket Fuel, which was looking to downsize, and immediately leased the space to IPG, which now occupies a total of 607,000 square feet in the building for its ad groups Mediabrands, FCB and Initiative. We also entered into important renewal leases with Fidelity Investments at 640 Fifth Avenue for 41,000 square feet and a law firm at 909 Third Avenue for 65,000 square feet. And finally, a renewal expansion with United Talent Agency at 888 Seventh Avenue for 43,000 square feet. 
Our activity at the start of 2016 remains strong. At 770, just last week, we signed an 80,000 square-foot expansion with Facebook, which has now grown to 355,000 square feet at 770 from its initial occupancy of 98,000 square feet in May 2013. We have a strong leasing pipeline of 1,350,000 square feet. This includes over 550,000 square feet in active lease documentation and another 800,000 square feet of leases in advanced discussions. 
With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, our lease expirations for the balance of 2016 are a modest 800,000 square feet, our normal run rate. And as we look out to 2017 and 2018, the expirations are around 1 million square feet a year with no one tenant representing more than 150,000 square feet. 
Over the last 3 years, we have completed a string of major building redevelopment, repositioning 7 buildings, a total of 6.4 million square feet. Our portfolio is in great shape. We transformed both 7 West 34th Street, bringing in Amazon to lease virtually the entire building, and 330 West 34th Street into 1.2 million square feet of creative class space. With its full block lobby, mid-block jewel box atrium and new curtain wall, 280 Park Avenue with JP Morgan Chase as our direct next-door neighbor, is now one of the best buildings on Park Avenue, attracting best-in-class boutique financial firms. At 1290 Avenue of the Americas and at 330 Madison Avenue, we executed dramatic building renovations and landed Neuberger Berman at 1290 and Guggenheim Partners at 330 as the building's signature tenant. And we are now in the final stages of completing our program at 90 Park Avenue, attracting both traditional financial service firms as well as the creative types. We will be happy to take you on a tour of our portfolio to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the dramatic public spaces. Call Cathy. My development and leasing teams are enormously proud of what we have accomplished and enjoy showing off our assets. 
With the completion of these renovation programs, you may be asking yourselves, so what's next? Of course, there is Penn Plaza. This is the submarket, whose time has now come. Last month, Governor Cuomo unveiled an ambitious infrastructure plan for New York State, including an array of downstate transportation projects: A new cross Hudson rail tunnel, an addition of a third track to a portion of the Long Island railroad; a train to La Guardia Airport and more. It's an impressive array of projects. And most importantly, as the governor stated, Penn Station, and I'm now quoting, ""Penn Station will be the nexus for all this increased capacity, doubling the traffic through Penn Station over the next 15 years."" That is very, very good news for our 9 million square feet of holdings in Penn Plaza. 
While our Penn Plaza assets have, for the better part of 20 years, been fully leased, rents remain substantially below what we believe these buildings can achieve, given their unmatched access to transportation and their location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. We see a tremendous opportunity to reposition these assets, in line with what we have done elsewhere in the city. Consider for a moment just 1 Penn and 2 Penn Plaza, 2 buildings that sit directly on top of and have access to Penn Station without ever stepping outside. These are buildings that represent a significant value creation opportunity. Our team continues to advance plan to turn these 2 buildings into a massive 4.2 million square foot Penn Plaza complex, fully modernized with shared amenity spaces integrated both above and below ground. When you consider our other development opportunities in the district, it's easy to see why Steve describes Penn Plaza as the Big Kahuna. 
For a glimpse into the future of the area, be sure to stop in for a bite at the new Pennsy. It's a food hall we recently created in 2 Penn Plaza at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Spend a few minutes enjoying a meal and a cocktail, or wait until the weather gets a bit warmer and we open up the rolltop garage doors onto Plaza33. As you know, last year, we implemented a temporary closure of 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue to create a public amenity called Plaza33. The Plaza earned rave reviews from the press, elected officials and the local community. We continue to work with the city and the local community board and are hopeful that Plaza33 will return later this year as a permanent year-round feature. I hope you will stop by. 
Another answer to the question of what's next is our growing beachhead in the West Chelsea district. At 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street and 512 West 22nd Street right on the High Line, we have partnered to develop ground up, 2 new boutique office buildings. Also at 260 Eleventh Avenue, we have the opportunity to totally redevelop and expand an asset we acquired in an off-market transaction. When you consider where these assets are located and the quality of the architecture, you will see that these buildings will be the trophy assets of the future. 
Let me now turn to our important Manhattan street retail portfolio, where, as you know, in 2015, we signed the 3 largest leases in the market, all on Fifth Avenue: A 64,000 square-foot flagship with Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue; and 2 leases with Swatch for its luxury brands; and for Harry Winston at the St. Regis retail. The aggregate starting rents for these leases are $70 million. Think about it. The rent coming out of these 3 retail leases
[Audio Gap]
million square foot office building. We delivered possession of the 640 space to Victoria's Secret on February 1, and both Swatch spaces have now been delivered. Revenue recognition on a GAAP basis has now commenced. In total, for the year 2015, we completed 20 retail leases with positive mark-to-markets of 99% GAAP, a 2 multiple; and 149% cash, a 2.5 multiple. We have good activity on our remaining spaces at 1535 as well as the 3200 square foot store we carved out of 640 with 25 feet of frontage. 
I'll touch only briefly on theMART in River North in Chicago, since I spent quite a bit of time on the transformation of this iconic asset on our last call. For the year, we leased more than 750,000 square feet in 86 transactions, including headquarters relocations for ConAgra Foods and Allstate and expansions by PayPal, Yelp and the prominent technology incubator, 1871, all at average positive mark-to-markets of 25.3% GAAP and 20.5% cash. This monumental 3.6 million square-foot asset is 98.5% leased. We are well into our 40-plus million dollar redevelopment program to add state-of-the-art amenities to theMART, a grand stair with stadium seating for our tenants to congregate, including a presentation venue, and bringing new life to the first 2 floors of the building as well as trendsetting food options and a reimagined food hall. We could not be happier with the performance of this asset. 
On to San Francisco. 2015 was a relatively quiet leasing year for us in San Francisco, where our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California Street property is an iconic part of the skyline. After a very active 2013 and 2014, when we leased over 900,000 square feet at the property, in 2015, we leased a total of 98,000 square feet at average starting rents in excess of $83 per square foot and at positive cash mark-to-markets of 34.8%. While the tower at 555 California is fully leased at an occupancy rate of 98.4%, in the fourth quarter, Bank of America, as expected, vacated the old banking hall at 345 Montgomery Street as well as the space it occupied in the adjacent 315 Montgomery Street building, a total of about 200,000 square feet. We are currently prepping the space with exposed brick walls and open-plan space for today's creative class of tenants and introduce the space to the marketplace with a broker event in the building just last week. We remain very constructive on the San Francisco market. 
Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same-store numbers for the New York business for 2015 were a positive 2.4% GAAP and 1.3% cash. And for the fourth quarter, the same-store numbers were positive 1.4% GAAP and negative 4.4% cash. As we have said over the course of the year, these numbers are not reflective of the real growth in operating results for the New York division. 
I want to pause here a minute and talk about the negative same-store numbers for the fourth quarter. This is really important, and I want to go over these numbers carefully. In the fourth quarter of 2015, just in our New York office business, there was a 10% swing in the difference between our GAAP and our cash same-store numbers. GAAP same-store for the office business was a positive 3.7%, and cash same-store was a negative 6.1%. This is an unusual occurrence, which is attributable to the free-rent periods on the extraordinary amount of leasing that we completed in 2014, some 4.2 million square feet. 
Regarding the 2015 GAAP same-store results, as I've said in our previous calls, the tepid growth numbers reflect a dip in occupancy attributable to the redevelopment of 90 Park Avenue as well as the downtime in connection with the redevelopment of the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue for Victoria's Secret and the retail space we took back from Crate & Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. 2015's real growth came from placing our out-of-service properties, 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway, back into service, which contributed a total of $47 million of EBITDA growth, not reflected in our same-store results. And importantly, as Steve Theriot said earlier, our New York same-store results historically have been industry-leading and we fully expect same-store growth in our New York business to be back to well over 5% in 2016. 
Let me conclude. It was a strong year in New York for both the market and Vornado, and we believe we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of leasing activity. With a diverse employer base and a large talent pool, there is no place where we would rather be. And we're confident that the quality and location of our buildings, our team and our relationships in the marketplace will enable us to outperform the marketplace in any environment in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."

In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 201",1067,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 2014 to over 68,000 new jobs in 2015. Importantly, 48% of this growth was in office-using sectors with 32,900 new jobs. The passage of the 2-year federal budget has had a broad stabilizing effect on the local economy. And on the ground, the green shoots are sprouting a bit. We saw a pick-up in leasing activity and tours throughout 2015. Specifically, in our Washington portfolio, as we expected, our 2015 comparable EBITDA was down about $3.5 million from 2014. As Steve Theriot said earlier, in 2016, we expect EBITDA from our core Washington business will be flat to $4 million higher than 2015. However, that growth will be offset by 2 items: first, we expect occupancy of our Skyline properties to decline further, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million; second, we will be vacating and taking 1726 M and 1150 17th Street out of service, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. This spring, we will demolish these 2 obsolete buildings in preparation for the development in the future of a new state-of-the-art trophy office building, 1700 M, in the heart of the Central Business District. So summing it all up, we expect that Washington's 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me take a minute now to review our 2015 results. In 2015, we leased a lot of space, over 2.1 million square feet in 216 deals at an initial average cash rent of $40.20 per square foot. About 1/3 of our 2015 leases were new and expanding tenants, and the other 2/3 were renewals. We ended the year with office occupancy of 82.1%, an increase of 140 basis points over year-end 2014. Skyline fell to 50.1% occupancy by year-end, down 340 basis points from 2014, an obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our office occupancy at year-end was 89.9%, an improvement of 250 basis points over 2014.  Our Crystal City occupancy at year-end was 89.5%, an improvement of 430 basis points over 2014. On the residential side, we own 2,400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with a year-end occupancy of 96.1%. 
Focusing specifically on the fourth quarter for a moment, we leased 450,000 square feet, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 0.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.7%, a result we are pleased with, given the competition that exists for every lease. 
Our fourth quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 11.5% of initial rents or $5.06 per square foot per annum, trending lower than the prior quarters in 2015.
Now let's turn specifically to Crystal City and Pentagon City. In 2015, we executed 1.1 million square feet of office leases in Crystal City. Crystal City is starting to gain traction, as noted in several local brokerage reports.  JLL cited that Crystal City, led all other submarkets in the region in net absorption last year. Those deals were predominantly done by us. 
Cushman & Wakefield's recent market presentation referenced Crystal City's comeback and noted that Crystal City is doing what it takes to win big deals with 1.3 million square feet leased in 2015. Notably, in Q4, we executed a 35,000 square-foot lease with an insurance company, Dominion National, at 251 18th Street. And at the same building, we recently completed a 53,000 square-foot lease with Kumonix, an international development company. This 300,000 square-foot building, which was completely vacated by BRAC tenants, is now 95% leased. Also in Crystal City, 2221 South Clark Street, another office building previously vacated by defense agencies, has just reopened as WeWork's first location in Northern Virginia. In addition to our partnership with WeWork downtown in our Dupont Circle building, we now together converted this building into 216 collaborative-living, community-style apartments as well as 2 floors of WeWork co-working office space. The office portion opened on February 1. It looks great, and it's already 60% occupied. The residential units will be opened in the spring. We're excited to add this important layer to the Crystal City fabric and look forward to welcoming fresh new faces our community. 
Overall, we've now resolved or have pending about 74% of the original 2.4 million square feet of space vacated by BRAC tenants. We have 630,000 square feet left to resolve, and 412,000 square feet of that is in Skyline. In Crystal City, we have taken care of close to 90% or 1.3 million square feet of the original 1.4 million square feet of the BRAC space. We replaced BRAC tenants with a diverse array of associations, professional services and tech innovators, steadily changing the complexion and the demographics in Crystal City. 
We continue to change the street-level experience as well. Just last week, Sweetgreen, a local millennial favorite, opened its doors on Crystal Drive. Sweetgreen, Taylor Gourmet and Earth Treks, a new indoor climbing gym, are just a few of the new retailers who are bringing a fresh flavor of destination food and activity to Crystal City. We're also changing the physical experience. We recently received approval from Arlington County to begin redeveloping the building that will be vacated by the U.S. Marshals at the end of this year. Located on Crystal Drive, at the Metro, the newly rebranded 1770 Crystal Drive will be fully repositioned with a new skin, new lobby, new systems, new retail and a top floor conference center for delivery in early 2018. The building will be surrounded by restaurants and entertainment, adding to the street vitality. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we just kicked off preleasing on our new 699-unit apartment project, the Bartlett. Located directly atop the new Whole Foods and overlooking the Washington Monument, this 23-story building is already a Skyline maker. We officially opened in June and are eager to offer the best new amenity package in town to our residents. We continue to be excited about the additional value we can deliver in our D.C. portfolio, value that will come from leasing of our existing vacancy, finishing our new residential offerings and offerings that are under construction and building out our development pipeline. 
I want to thank you all, and I'd like to the turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The second thing is, is that we exited the retail, the non-Manhattan retail business for a variety of reasons. We noted several years ago a secular -- not a cyclical, a secular change in retailing patterns. We acted upon that. We exited the mall business entirely, swamping many of the assets for what we thought were better assets. But really -- and then what we decided, we did not want to sell the strip retail business, the Northeast business, which by the way had the Bergen Mall in it and 2 Puerto Rican malls in it, so it was sort of a little bit of a hybrid. We thought that it was a grand business, and we thought that the right move was to deconglomerate the business and have a very focused, laser-focused management on a smaller business. We see that the business with a great balance sheet, enough cash to succeed and a very, very engaged board, and we couldn't it be more pleased, as I said. The stock price is appropriate. Obviously, it could be a little bit higher, but it's appropriate, nowhere near the discount of Vornado, and we think it has a great future. So that is a very, very interesting template. There has been speculation about that we might do a similar thing with Washington. We're up to our eyeballs in considering that. So that is not -- that's something that is absolutely on the table, and we are absolutely considering. We think that was interestingly enough. If you take our Washington business -- and I also did say at the beginning of my remarks that Washington is in a slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline, and we do believe that and our numbers show that, by the way. If you look at Washington as a separate segment, which has been beatened up admittedly, and you project now a 4-, 5-, 6-year growth back to normalcy, it is a very high-growth, very interesting business."

We believe that the opportunity we have for value creation in the Penn Plaza, Penn Station area is truly unique and is enormous. So that's a unbelievably interesting, exciting business. The strategies of what we might do with it in terms of capital strategies, venture strategies or anything like that, we don't want to -- I don't want to speculate now.

The other assets that we have, where -- I mean, the mark businesses, a wonderful asset, which is in the middle of its value creation career, and 555 California, so the 2 assets that we have that are outlining New York are the best quality in each of those cities.

The other one is 2.5 million, 2.6 million, 2.7 million square feet. So in total, they are really -- they're sort of like kissing cousins and they comprise 4.12 million square feet in total. So it's massive, number one. Number two is they sit right on top of the busiest train station in North America. So that's unbelievable. There are no other buildings that share that honor, so to speak. And number three is that they are right in the center, right at the bull's eye of what we call and the marketplace calls the New West Side. So it's a tremendous opportunity. Now having said that, one of the real opportunities is that the buildings are sufficiently large so that the owner of the building -- and they are in one ownership, so there's a lot of benefits there. We can move tenants back and forth between the 2 buildings. If a tenant needs overflow space or expansion space and we don't have it in the building that they are in, we can move -- we can fit that up in an adjacent building, although that's interesting, because the buildings historically are always full. The second thing is we can afford to put an amenity complex into those 4-plus million square foot buildings that are not economic even for 0.5 million or 1 million foot building, which are also larger buildings. And the population of those buildings that will be coursing through the spaces is also enormous, and we can put food offerings and even delivery of food into the complex. So there is a lots of different ideas that we have, many of which are being taken from what the tech industry is doing on their big huge campuses. Now in terms of what they're going to cost, they are both going to be co-mingled with improvements which will affect Penn Station and the neighborhood. Now what I mean by that is, is that we are confident that we will -- that the 33rd Street will be closed, and that gives a great opportunity, and both of the buildings front on 33rd Street, to create entrances into the station, to create skylights and light into the stations and what have you. So it's very hard to -- which I've already said we are going to participate in, or at least we're going to participate in this RFP with all of -- enthusiastically and in a huge way. So it's hard to separate them. Now Two Penn, we've already said publicly that our plans are to completely skin the building, to take the skin of the building off and replace it with a new skin, which will have esthetic consequences, of course; but more importantly than that, it will allow, what, our old-fashioned hunched windows to grow to be almost, not quite, but almost floor-to-ceiling windows, which have large breadth and make the building looked like it was built recently, which will enormously increase the market value of the building. The skin will also involve  the entrance on Seventh Avenue to Penn Station, which is directly under our building, which is the main entrance to Penn Station. So there is lots of things going on here, which are enormously exciting. The Penn, the One Penn building will be more like in cost a conventional transformation and upgrade that we would do more expensive because it's twice the size, the Two Penn will be much more expensive because it involves a total re-skinning . So it's too early. It's premature to put a number on that. But I can tell you that we are unbelievably excited about the opportunity."

It's not just the musical chair business. As I said, last year, some 750,000-plus square feet of our deals were real growth to the city.

So the first thing is we see no deterioration in the New York Office business. That's step one. What's going to happen 9 months or a year from now, that's another question, and we see no basis upon which to believe that 9 months or a year from now, the New York Office business will be any different than it is today. So that's step one. I mean, obviously, if there's a deterioration in the economy, all bets are off, okay? So that's step 1. Step 2 is, is that New York benefits from an enormously diverse business community, and there are at any given time certain sectors which are expanding and certain sectors are contracting. We see no sign that people like Amazon and Facebook or their ilk are doing anything other than full steam ahead and expanding aggressively. So a lot of what happens to the individual companies is a function of the mix of their assets and to which segment of the office market they cater to.

The first thing is, I think some -- the secondary assets, I can't vouch for what the pricing is on secondary assets. For prime assets, we see no diminution in pricing. We do see that there are fewer bidders than at the historical top of the market, maybe whatever that was, a year ago, whatever, and so we think that the big thing is that -- and I sort of said this in my remarks, this swoon, I'll call that a swoon for the moment for want of a better word, and the volatility in the capital markets, I believe and most commentators believe, will cause an extension of below-interest-rate, easy-money environment that we have found ourselves in for years and years now. And it's very hard to understand how, with the treasury at 1.8% today, that cap rates can go above go above 4.5%, let's say, into the 5s and 6s. So the interest rate environment and the wall of liquidity, which still exists, is an anchor on keeping pricing firm. The next part of it is, is that it's not random that we and our colleagues operate in New York City, which we consider to be the magnet for both domestic and international capital to invest in real estate. And also, it's when -- history has shown that when there is volatility in the capital markets, after the initial jitters are over, this real estate becomes an extraordinarily important store of value that has over decades and decades.

So let me just discuss it again. What we did there was it's a 1.1 million square-foot building, which has extraordinary tenants. By the way, it's a mature building, which is my way of saying it's -- basically it's a 100 acres department store, so it has enormous wall place, high ceilings, great windows. It's a terrific building and a terrific spot, although it is not anywhere -- it is not by any stretch a prom and -- a steel-and-glass building, anyway. So we financed it. We refinanced the $350-odd million loan in the 5s for $700 million, and we did it on a floating-rate basis, and they floated at LIBOR 1.75, and then we swapped the floating rate to fixed. So we have an extensive capital markets team here, and we analyzed every different option in terms of both duration of loan and floating fixed, et cetera. And so we basically have borrowed a -- made it a 5-year fixed loan. It's actually technically a 4.5-year fixed, which is another whole tale. We swapped it for 4.5 years, and the rate is 2.56. Now that's an extraordinary rate for a high-quality building. It's really hard to see how cap rates rise with that kind of finance available.

The office building, we own half the retail together with a co-venture partner -- I'm sorry, half the office building together with a co-venture partner, the building has a very hefty loan on it.

It's obviously competitive market, but nonetheless, we are constructive with the progress that we've made in terms of moving a significant amount of the inventory. At this point in time, we're not moving our rents up. We certainly think that the rents and concessions have bottomed. So we'll keep close eye and see how that moves off into the future.

I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks are a little long, but be assured we will leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
Yesterday, we reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.27 per share, 10.4% better than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our full comparable -- our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, 10.5% better than 2014. If we were to exclude our real estate fund, the increase over 2014 would have been 16.3%.  Our earnings growth was driven by our flagship New York business, and as David will cover shortly, our New York business will continue to produce strong growth in 2015. 
Company-wide, in 2015, we leased 5,381,000 square feet in 483 transactions with overall positive mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 12% cash. In New York, we leased 2,276,000 square feet for the year and 610,000 square feet for the fourth quarter at positive GAAP mark-to-markets of 22.8% for the year and an even higher 25.7% for the fourth quarter. These are great numbers. Mitchell and David will give you details of their businesses shortly. Washington is now a tale of slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline. 
With respect to Penn Plaza, we are delighted that Governor Cuomo has shined a bright light on the importance of Penn Station as New York City's busiest transportation hub and the crying need for improvement. Vornado will be a full participant in this process. The Penn Plaza District, where we are the dominant owner with 9 million square feet, is a great opportunity for us. We are knee-deep in planning multiple projects to transform and enhance our vast Penn Plaza holdings. We are the industry leader in capital programs to reposition and upgrade office and retail assets so as to achieve their full potential. As David will tell you, next up is our grand plan to upgrade, modernize and transform One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza into an integrated 4.2 million square-foot complex sitting directly on top of Penn Station in the center of what has become New York's new West Side. The goal here is to achieve market rents as much as 50% higher than today's rents. 
Almost a year ago, in my letter to shareholders and each -- and in each of our last 3 quarterly calls, I stated that the easy money has been made for this cycle, asset prices are high, well past the 2007 peak. It's a better time to sell than to invest. And most importantly, now is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. To be honest, I didn't expect to be so right so quickly. With many sectors of the economy decelerating, we are experiencing a period of high volatility in both the credit markets and the equity markets. This will, of course, have some effect on the real estate markets. So we have been preparing for all this for whatever is to come. Vornado is buttoned up and ready. Our New York properties are very well leased; we are basically full. Our income stream is diversified, coming from over 1,200 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Our top 10 tenants account for only 13.2% of revenue. It is a testament to the quality of our assets and our leasing machine that Victoria's Secret chose, in a very competitive make-off [ph], to locate their 64,000 square-foot Fifth Avenue flagship with us. Same for Facebook, Amazon, Foot Locker and Neuberger Berman and on and on, you get the picture. 
In this environment, cash is king. Today, we have $4.5 million of immediate -- $4.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and our fully undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. On top of that, we have over $13 billion of highest-quality unencumbered properties. 
Last year in my annual letter to shareholders, on Page 10 if you would like to reread it, I laid out our debt philosophy. Vornado enjoys access to the 4 corners of the capital markets. We prefer secured debt that is recoursed solely to a single property rather than unsecured corporate debt that bears the full faith and credit of the issuer, sort of like a personal guaranty. It is interesting to note that today, secured debt for a sponsor of the standing -- of our standing is both readily available and surprisingly cheaper than the unsecured full faith and credit-type debt. The unsecured and CMBS debt markets are getting a little jumpy. Vornado today has only $850 million of unsecured debt in 2 issues, maturing 4 and 7 years out. 
Vornado is focused and simplified and ready for battle, having sold, spun or pruned over $8.7 billion of assets. True to our word, we have sold much more than we have acquired. Acquisitions have been limited to strategic New York retail properties and creative class value-added office projects. We have pushed the way from acquisitions which were off the fairway, nonstrategic, or most importantly, overpriced. Importantly, we have also significantly upgraded the mix and quality of our assets. For example, trading 1740 Broadway, B office building for the St. Regis retail, 866 UN Plaza for 655 Fifth Avenue retail with Ferragamo store, the Green Acres B+ mall for the retail block at 666 Fifth Avenue and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue for Old Navy on 34th street. 
Three years ago, anticipating secular change, note the current softness in retail and recognizing that with only a handful of malls, we were in no man's land, we decided to exit all non-Manhattan retail. I believe this decision will look better and better and better as each year goes by. 
A word about our shopping center spin, Urban Edge Properties. Celebrating its first anniversary, we couldn't be more delighted with its performance. We created UE by seeding it with our unique, high variant, northeastern shopping center assets. And with our management and staff, we recruited Jeff Olson, a best-in-class CEO, and washed it with a strong balance sheet supported by an experienced and engaged board. Urban Edge is producing the exact result we had expected. And investors, the final report card, are rewarding UE with an appropriate stock price, which, by the way, has held rock solid in the recent months of carnage. And think about it, if the UE assets were still bundled inside Vornado, they probably would be valued at a big discount just like Vornado is. Given the success of UE, the concept of labor -- laser-focused smaller entities may well be a template for the future. 
Our 220 Central Park South supertall residential condominium tower is also buttoned up. It is now 260 feet vertical and visible from Central Park. It will rise at the rate of 1 floor per week. We have dedicated super-low interest rate financing in place, sufficient to fund the entire project. We are over 50% under contract at record-setting pricing, which covers our costs. We will deliver in 2018, and trust me, there will be at least 2 more up-and-down cycles before then. That's sort of a joke. 
As asset values have risen over the cycle, we have pulled back from making loans, especially mezzanine loans. We now have only a couple of small loans left on our books. 
Now if I may, a few words about the New York real estate markets. We see no real hiccups so far in the Class A office market. Vornado's office business continues to perform at very high levels. We do anticipate that decision-makers will take note of the financial volatility and pause, slow down and rethink a little. Of course, we are constantly looking over our shoulders; that's our job. But business continues to be great, so far, so good. David and Mitchell will discuss the health of their markets with you in a moment. My personal favorite, as David will tell you, is that a full 25% of Vornado's New York leasing in 2015 was at rents over $100 per foot. Pretty amazing. I was going to say and they'll move over more, but my team wouldn't let me say it. So I didn't say it. 
Nationwide, retail sales are soft and shopping center traffic has been declining quarter-over-quarter. In Manhattan, as I've said before, momentum investors have driven retail asset prices too high. Landlord asking rents are also too high, exceeding retailer's willingness and ability to pay. Trust me, we are the biggest player in this market by far, and we are in the business of being realistic in terms of pricing and making deals. And at our basis, we sure can. 
Hotels are soft. Just look at the hotel stocks, which are off 1/3 to 1/2. In my mind, the New York hotel industry is the victim of gross cyclical oversupply, even more than the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. New York has added 25,000 rooms in 2010 to a base of 82,000 rooms and -- with 18,000 more rooms under construction, too much supply. And then, of course, there is Airbnb, sort of like what e-shopping is to brick-and-mortar retailing. Interestingly, while people say that the strong dollar is causing a decline in tourism, the numbers show that both domestic and international tourism are holding up just fine. Vornado has a very limited exposure to the hotel market, principally, the Hotel Pennsylvania, which is really a parking lot. 
The for-sale condo business has dramatically slowed at all price points and in all neighborhoods. It's easy to blame the volatility we are now seeing on the financial markets for the buyers' pause, but the slowdown actually started 6 months ago. There seems to be a condo project on every block, most being developed by undercapitalized, over-leveraged players. Vornado's sole exposure to the condo business is our 220 Central Park South project, which is in a class by itself. 
A word about the credit markets, which are becoming a tale of the haves and the have-nots. For sponsors such as Vornado, the credit markets are open at historically low rates. On the other side of the spectrum, for risk assets and less-established sponsors, the credit markets are clogged and choppy. Here's an example I'd like to share with you. Last week, we closed a $700 million, 5-year floating rate loan on 770 Broadway at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which we swapped to fixed at 2.56%. I think 2.56% fixed for what is actually a 4.5 year swap on a $700 million loan is a truly spectacular rate. And by the way, just for reference, that rate is a full 59 basis points better than the rate on a similar loan we closed just 2 months ago. 
It's too early to tell what effect the recent volatility in the financial markets will have on leasing or on asset valuation. My guess is not all that much. We have been long overdue for a correction, and after all, a swoon in economic activity and volatility in the debt and equity markets seem a sure recipe for continued easy money and low interest rates. 
I'll conclude with a listing of our priorities, what we're focusing on and what are proving important in our business. One, buttoning up and focusing on being strong and ready, both financially and in every other way. And by the way, we are beginning to see a few interesting opportunities; two, recognizing the full potential of our vast Penn Plaza assets. Actually, Penn Plaza is a city within a city; and three, closing the gap between our stock price and the true value of our company. By the way, Green Street's NAV for Vornado is $125 a share. 
Thank you for listening. I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share last year, also a very strong 10.5% increase. The increase in our comparable FFO in 2015 versus the prior year was clouded by lower gains in 2015 from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund. Excluding this effect, our comparable FFO for the year would have increased 13 -- I'm sorry, 16.3%. Not surprisingly, our growth comes from our large and strong New York business. 
Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the full year was $5.48 per share compared to $4.83 per share for the prior year. Noncomparable FFO items aggregated $19.4 million of income for the fourth quarter compared to $13 million of income for the fourth quarter of last year. 2015 noncomparable items aggregated $123.7 million of income, consisting primarily of a $90 million reversal of an allowance on deferred tax assets of our taxable resubsidiaries and $46.4 million of FFO from the operations of 20 Broad and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, which we sold. Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on pages 37 and 38 of our annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed summary of noncomparable items. 
Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was $400.7 million, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 9.6%. Our full year comparable EBITDA was $1.533 billion, ahead of last year by 5.9%. Excluding the effect of our real estate fund, our full year comparable EBITDA increased by 8.9%. 
Our New York business produced $283.5 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by a strong $29.2 million or 11.5%. Comparable EBITDA for the New York business was $1.079 billion for the year or 12.2% ahead of 2014. The increases in comparable EBITDA for the quarter and the year were driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service, primarily 7 West 34th, 330 West 34th Street and the Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway; and acquisitions, primarily the St. Regis retail, 150 West 34th Street and the Center building in Long Island city. 
Our New York same-store results are historically industry leading, and we expect to have same-store growth well over 5% in 2016, sequentially higher in the second half than in the first half. When thinking about our earnings in 2016, please keep in mind that we recognized $28 million of onetime income in 2015 from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to the early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel lease at 1650 Madison. While this income is included in our 2015 comparable results, it is not included in our 2015 same-store results. 
Our Washington business produced $79.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, flat to last year's fourth quarter. For the year, Washington's comparable EBITDA was $3.5 million behind last year, on target with our updated guidance. With respect to 2016, we expect that Washington's comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015, comprised of our core Washington business being flat to $4 million higher, offset by occupancy of our Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million and 1726 M and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A trophy office building, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. 
Now turning to capital markets. In November, we completed an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750 million. The facility is separate and in addition to our $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities and will be used for the specific purpose of funding the construction of our 220 Central Park South luxury condo tower. This facility matures in October 2018 with 2 1-year extension options to 2020. The interest rate is a tight LIBOR plus 115 basis points with a fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing, we draw -- we drew $187.5 million. This facility, together with the in-place $950 million loan, provides funding for all of the costs of the development of 220 Central Park South. 
In December, we completed a $450 million financing of the St. Regis retail located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The loan matures in December 2020 with 2 1-year extension options. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.8% for the first 3 years, LIBOR plus 1.9% for years 4 and 5 and LIBOR plus 2% during the extension periods. 
In December, we completed a $375 million refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, an 882,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.6%, which we'll swap for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 3.15%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $49 million after repaying the existing 5.71%, $319 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in January 2016. 
Last week, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which will swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in March 2016. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $708.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million Mart loan, which matures in December 2016, and the $115 million Bowen property loan, which matures in June 2016. We are well along working on these refinancings. Excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South project and including the capital market transactions completed in 2016, our consolidated debt metrics are debt-to-enterprise value of 34%; debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 6.2x; fixed rate debt accounted for 77% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0% and a weighted average term of 5.8 years. 
Our share of 2016 debt maturities of partially owned entities are $736.4 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue; $161 million at the Warner Building; and $138 million at One Park Avenue. We're also well along on working on these refinancings. Including our share of partially owned entities' debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio goes to 7.5x from 6.2x for our consolidated debt. 
Okay. As we disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements, we recognized onetime tax deductions related to the implementation of the tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. These deductions and gains from sales transactions resulted in 100% of our 2015 common dividend being classified as long-term capital gains. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet. Our leverage is modest, and our maturities are well staggered. The vast majority of our debt is conservatively sized property-level secured mortgages. We have a very high-quality portfolio of unencumbered properties. As of -- we have, as of today, $4.5 billion of liquidity comprised of $2 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.5 undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294802,934922,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone.

It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate mar",2761,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone. Before I jump into a review of our business for 2015, I want to step back and spend a few minutes talking about market conditions. It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate market in New York. In a nutshell, I would say that business has been and remains good. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan in 2015 was strong, 28.2 million square feet transacted, the third highest in a decade. At a 9.4% availability rate in Manhattan, the rate was 80 basis points lower at year-end 2015 than 2014. In 2015, 4.5 million square feet of space was absorbed in Manhattan, with Midtown accounting for some 75% of the positive absorption, 3.3 million square feet. We are now 6-plus years into this growth cycle with availability rates having come down by over 340 basis points from 12.8% to the current 9.4%. And during that time period, there was a total absorption of more than 20 million square feet of space in the market. 
Absorption and employment, of course, are directly linked. New York has been an amazing magnet for job growth. From the trough in 2009 August through year-end 2015, private sector employment in New York has gained over 600,000 jobs, over 4x the number of jobs lost in the recession and is now at an all-time record high. In our business, of course, we focus more closely on New York City's office-using employment number, which also has continued to expand, gaining 31,000 jobs in 2015. Since office-using employment bottomed in 2009, New York City has added over 200,000 office-using jobs, double the number of jobs lost, and again, is at an all-time high. While the city's office of management and budget is projecting a lower rate of job growth in 2016 of about 60,000 private sector jobs, that still represents a very healthy growth rate of 1.7%. The city now has a highly diversified local economy with TAMI tenancies, technology, advertising, media and information as well as the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real estate, both driving its strong job growth. As Steve would say, we are no longer a 1-trick financial services pony in New York. 
Let me now turn to our own portfolio. In 2015, in our New York office portfolio, we completed 2.3 million square feet of leasing activity in 165 transactions with a very diverse mix of high-quality tenants across many business sectors. We achieved our highest ever average starting rents of just under $79 per square foot, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 22.8% GAAP and 19.1% cash. Importantly, 32% of our 2.3 million square feet of leasing, some 750,000 square feet, represented tenants new to New York or expanding in New York. Real expansion, real growth. Let me give you some of the names: IPG; the Interpublic Group of Companies; Facebook; AOL; United Talent Agency; PJT Partners; FactSet, PPG; Foot Locker; Parsons Brinckerhoff; and GIC, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. 
As many of the brokerage firms have noted, in 2015, the FIRE sector reemerged as the top driver of leasing with nearly 1/3 of overall activity. That move back to finance and the boutique asset management and private equity firms has had a notable impact at the high end of the marketplace. In a $100-plus per square foot marketplace, citywide in 2015, 138 leases were executed. We completed 28 of those leases, a 20% market share, for a total, as Steve had mentioned, of 400 -- 544,000 square feet, which was 25% of our total leasing activity. Think about it. With less than a 5% market share, we did 20% of the triple-digit deals in the market and more than any other landlord, spread in 6 of our trophy buildings: 650 Madison Avenue; 888 Seventh Avenue; 350 Park Avenue; 280 Park Avenue; 640 Fifth Avenue; and 770 Broadway, all at average starting rents of $108 per square foot. This certainly speaks to the quality of our assets. 
I might also add that while historically, the $100- plus per square foot marketplace had been limited to small space users, last year, we completed 2 of the 4 largest triple-digit leases in the city: one, with a private equity firm at 888 Seventh Avenue for 93,000 square feet; and the other with a tech company at 770 Broadway for 80,000 square feet. 
Let me now quickly turn to the fourth quarter. We completed over 600,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter at average starting rents of $75 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 25.7% GAAP and 22.4% cash. Our year-end occupancy was 96.3%. We remain basically full. 
A couple of highlights for the quarter. In Penn Plaza, at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed an 82,000 square-foot lease with Structure Tone, which will join this building's diverse tenant roster of Foot Locker, Deutsch Advertising, Yodle and New York & Company. With this deal, the building is now 90% leased up. We actually moved Structure Tone, our tenant at 770 Broadway, to 330 West 34th Street to free up to lease an additional floor in 770 Broadway to AOL, which is now owned by Verizon and in a growth mode. AOL now occupies a total of 308,000 square feet in 770 Broadway. At 100 West 33rd Street, the office portion of the Manhattan Mall, we took back a floor from Rocket Fuel, which was looking to downsize, and immediately leased the space to IPG, which now occupies a total of 607,000 square feet in the building for its ad groups Mediabrands, FCB and Initiative. We also entered into important renewal leases with Fidelity Investments at 640 Fifth Avenue for 41,000 square feet and a law firm at 909 Third Avenue for 65,000 square feet. And finally, a renewal expansion with United Talent Agency at 888 Seventh Avenue for 43,000 square feet. 
Our activity at the start of 2016 remains strong. At 770, just last week, we signed an 80,000 square-foot expansion with Facebook, which has now grown to 355,000 square feet at 770 from its initial occupancy of 98,000 square feet in May 2013. We have a strong leasing pipeline of 1,350,000 square feet. This includes over 550,000 square feet in active lease documentation and another 800,000 square feet of leases in advanced discussions. 
With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, our lease expirations for the balance of 2016 are a modest 800,000 square feet, our normal run rate. And as we look out to 2017 and 2018, the expirations are around 1 million square feet a year with no one tenant representing more than 150,000 square feet. 
Over the last 3 years, we have completed a string of major building redevelopment, repositioning 7 buildings, a total of 6.4 million square feet. Our portfolio is in great shape. We transformed both 7 West 34th Street, bringing in Amazon to lease virtually the entire building, and 330 West 34th Street into 1.2 million square feet of creative class space. With its full block lobby, mid-block jewel box atrium and new curtain wall, 280 Park Avenue with JP Morgan Chase as our direct next-door neighbor, is now one of the best buildings on Park Avenue, attracting best-in-class boutique financial firms. At 1290 Avenue of the Americas and at 330 Madison Avenue, we executed dramatic building renovations and landed Neuberger Berman at 1290 and Guggenheim Partners at 330 as the building's signature tenant. And we are now in the final stages of completing our program at 90 Park Avenue, attracting both traditional financial service firms as well as the creative types. We would be happy to take you on a tour of our portfolio to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the dramatic public spaces. Call Cathy. My development and leasing teams are enormously proud of what we have accomplished and enjoy showing off our assets. 
With the completion of these renovation programs, you may be asking yourselves, so what's next? Of course, there is Penn Plaza. This is the submarket, whose time has now come. Last month, Governor Cuomo unveiled an ambitious infrastructure plan for New York State, including an array of downstate transportation projects: A new cross Hudson rail tunnel, an addition of a third track to a portion of the Long Island railroad; a train to La Guardia Airport and more. It's an impressive array of projects. And most importantly, as the governor stated, Penn Station, and I'm now quoting, ""Penn Station will be the nexus for all this increased capacity, doubling the traffic through Penn Station over the next 15 years."" That is very, very good news for our 9 million square feet of holdings in Penn Plaza. 
While our Penn Plaza assets have, for the better part of 20 years, been fully leased, rents remain substantially below what we believe these buildings can achieve, given their unmatched access to transportation and their location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. We see a tremendous opportunity to reposition these assets, in line with what we have done elsewhere in the city. Consider for a moment just 1 Penn and 2 Penn Plaza, 2 buildings that sit directly on top of and have access to Penn Station without ever stepping outside. These are buildings that represent a significant value creation opportunity. Our team continues to advance plan to turn these 2 buildings into a massive 4.2 million square foot Penn Plaza complex, fully modernized with shared amenity spaces integrated both above and below ground. When you consider our other development opportunities in the district, it's easy to see why Steve describes Penn Plaza as the Big Kahuna. 
For a glimpse into the future of the area, be sure to stop in for a bite at the new Pennsy. It's a food hall we recently created in 2 Penn Plaza at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Spend a few minutes enjoying a meal and a cocktail, or wait until the weather gets a bit warmer and we open up the rolltop garage doors onto Plaza33. As you know, last year, we implemented a temporary closure of 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue to create a public amenity called Plaza33. The Plaza earned rave reviews from the press, elected officials and the local community. We continue to work with the city and the local community board and are hopeful that Plaza33 will return later this year as a permanent year-round feature. I hope you will stop by. 
Another answer to the question of what's next is our growing beachhead in the West Chelsea district. At 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street and 512 West 22nd Street right on the High Line, we have partnered to develop ground up, 2 new boutique office buildings. Also at 260 Eleventh Avenue, we have the opportunity to totally redevelop and expand an asset we acquired in an off-market transaction. When you consider where these assets are located and the quality of the architecture, you will see that these buildings will be the trophy assets of the future. 
Let me now turn to our important Manhattan street retail portfolio, where, as you know, in 2015, we signed the 3 largest leases in the market, all on Fifth Avenue: A 64,000 square-foot flagship with Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue; and 2 leases with Swatch for its luxury brands; and for Harry Winston at the St. Regis retail. The aggregate starting rents for these leases are $70 million. Think about it. The rent coming out of these 3 retail leases
[Audio Gap]
million square foot office building. We delivered possession of the 640 space to Victoria's Secret on February 1, and both Swatch spaces have now been delivered. Revenue recognition on a GAAP basis has now commenced. In total, for the year 2015, we completed 20 retail leases with positive mark-to-markets of 99% GAAP, a 2 multiple; and 149% cash, a 2.5 multiple. We have good activity on our remaining spaces at 1535 as well as the 3200 square foot store we carved out of 640 with 25 feet of frontage. 
I'll touch only briefly on the Mart in River North in Chicago, since I spent quite a bit of time on the transformation of this iconic asset on our last call. For the year, we leased more than 750,000 square feet in 86 transactions, including headquarters relocations for ConAgra Foods and Allstate and expansions by PayPal, Yelp and the prominent technology incubator, 1871, all at average positive mark-to-markets of 25.3% GAAP and 20.5% cash. This monumental 3.6 million square-foot asset is 98.5% leased. We are well into our 40-plus million dollar redevelopment program to add state-of-the-art amenities to the Mart, a grand stair with stadium seating for our tenants to congregate, including a presentation venue, and bringing new life to the first 2 floors of the building as well as trendsetting food options and a reimagined food hall. We could not be happier with the performance of this asset. 
On to San Francisco. 2015 was a relatively quiet leasing year for us in San Francisco, where our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California Street property is an iconic part of the skyline. After a very active 2013 and 2014, when we leased over 900,000 square feet at the property, in 2015, we leased a total of 98,000 square feet at average starting rents in excess of $83 per square foot and at positive cash mark-to-markets of 34.8%. While the tower at 555 California is fully leased at an occupancy rate of 98.4%, in the fourth quarter, Bank of America, as expected, vacated the old banking hall at 345 Montgomery Street as well as the space it occupied in the adjacent 315 Montgomery Street building, a total of about 200,000 square feet. We are currently prepping the space with exposed brick walls and open-plan space for today's creative class of tenants and introduced the space to the marketplace with a broker event in the building just last week. We remain very constructive on the San Francisco market. 
Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same-store numbers for the New York business for 2015 were a positive 2.4% GAAP and 1.3% cash. And for the fourth quarter, the same-store numbers were positive 1.4% GAAP and negative 4.4% cash. As we have said over the course of the year, these numbers are not reflective of the real growth in operating results for the New York division. 
I want to pause here a minute and talk about the negative same-store numbers for the fourth quarter. This is really important, and I want to go over these numbers carefully. In the fourth quarter of 2015, just in our New York office business, there was a 10% swing in the difference between our GAAP and our cash same-store numbers. GAAP same-store for the office business was a positive 3.7%, and cash same-store was a negative 6.1%. This is an unusual occurrence, which is attributable to the free-rent periods on the extraordinary amount of leasing that we completed in 2014, some 4.2 million square feet. 
Regarding the 2015 GAAP same-store results, as I've said in our previous calls, the tepid growth numbers reflect a dip in occupancy attributable to the redevelopment of 90 Park Avenue as well as the downtime in connection with the redevelopment of the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue for Victoria's Secret and the retail space we took back from Crate & Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. 2015's real growth came from placing our out-of-service properties, 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway, back into service, which contributed a total of $47 million of EBITDA growth, not reflected in our same-store results. And importantly, as Steve Theriot said earlier, our New York same-store results historically have been industry-leading and we fully expect same-store growth in our New York business to be back to well over 5% in 2016. 
Let me conclude. It was a strong year in New York for both the market and Vornado, and we believe we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of leasing activity. With a diverse employer base and a large talent pool, there is no place where we would rather be. And we're confident that the quality and location of our buildings, our team and our relationships in the marketplace will enable us to outperform the marketplace in any environment in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."

In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen.

In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 2014 to over 68,000 new jobs in 2015. Importantly, 48% of this growth was in office-using sectors with 32,900 new jobs. The passage of the 2-year federal budget has had a broad stabilizing effect on the local economy. And on the ground, the green shoots are sprouting a bit. We saw a pick-up in leasing activity and tours throughout 2015. Specifically, in our Washington portfolio, as we expected, our 2015 comparable EBITDA was down about $3.5 million from 2014. As Steve Theriot said earlier, in 2016, we expect EBITDA from our core Washington business will be flat to $4 million higher than 2015. However, that growth will be offset by 2 items: first, we expect occupancy of our Skyline properties to decline further, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million; second, we will be vacating and taking 1726 M and 1150 17th Street out of service, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. This spring, we will demolish these 2 obsolete buildings in preparation for the development in the future of a new state-of-the-art trophy office building, 1700 M, in the heart of the Central Business District. So summing it all up, we expect that Washington's 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me take a minute now to review our 2015 results. In 2015, we leased a lot of space, over 2.1 million square feet in 216 deals at an initial average cash rent of $40.20 per square foot. About 1/3 of our 2015 leases were new and expanding tenants, and the other 2/3 were renewals. We ended the year with office occupancy of 82.1%, an increase of 140 basis points over year-end 2014. Skyline fell to 50.1% occupancy by year-end, down 340 basis points from 2014, an obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our office occupancy at year-end was 89.9%, an improvement of 250 basis points over 2014.  Our Crystal City occupancy at year-end was 89.5%, an improvement of 430 basis points over 2014. On the residential side, we own 2,400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with a year-end occupancy of 96.1%. 
Focusing specifically on the fourth quarter for a moment, we leased 450,000 square feet, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 0.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.7%, a result we are pleased with, given the competition that exists for every lease. 
Our fourth quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 11.5% of initial rents or $5.06 per square foot per annum, trending lower than the prior quarters in 2015.
Now let's turn specifically to Crystal City and Pentagon City. In 2015, we executed 1.1 million square feet of office leases in Crystal City. Crystal City is starting to gain traction, as noted in several local brokerage reports. JLL cited that Crystal City led all other submarkets in the region in net absorption last year. Those deals were predominantly done by us. 
Cushman & Wakefield's recent market presentation referenced Crystal City's comeback and noted that Crystal City is doing what it takes to win big deals with 1.3 million square feet leased in 2015. Notably, in Q4, we executed a 35,000 square-foot lease with an insurance company, Dominion National, at 251 18th Street. And at the same building, we recently completed a 53,000 square-foot lease with Kumonix, an international development company. This 300,000 square-foot building, which was completely vacated by BRAC tenants, is now 95% leased. Also in Crystal City, 2221 South Clark Street, another office building previously vacated by defense agencies, has just reopened as WeWork's first location in Northern Virginia. In addition to our partnership with WeWork downtown in our Dupont Circle building, we now together converted this building into 216 collaborative-living, community-style apartments as well as 2 floors of WeWork co-working office space. The office portion opened on February 1. It looks great, and it's already 60% occupied. The residential units will be open in the spring. We're excited to add this important layer to the Crystal City fabric and look forward to welcoming fresh new faces to our community. 
Overall, we've now resolved or have pending about 74% of the original 2.4 million square feet of space vacated by BRAC tenants. We have 630,000 square feet left to resolve, and 412,000 square feet of that is in Skyline. In Crystal City, we have taken care of close to 90% or 1.3 million square feet of the original 1.4 million square feet of the BRAC space. We replaced BRAC tenants with a diverse array of associations, professional services and tech innovators, steadily changing the complexion and the demographics in Crystal City. 
We continue to change the street-level experience as well. Just last week, Sweetgreen, a local millennial favorite, opened its doors on Crystal Drive. Sweetgreen, Taylor Gourmet and Earth Treks, our new indoor climbing gym, are just a few of the new retailers who are bringing a fresh flavor of destination food and activity to Crystal City. We're also changing the physical experience. We recently received approval from Arlington County to begin redeveloping the building that will be vacated by the U.S. Marshals at the end of this year. Located on Crystal Drive, at the Metro, the newly rebranded 1770 Crystal Drive will be fully repositioned with a new skin, new lobby, new systems, new retail and a top floor conference center for delivery in early 2018. The building will be surrounded by restaurants and entertainment, adding to the street vitality. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we just kicked off preleasing on our new 699-unit apartment project, the Bartlett. Located directly atop the new Whole Foods and overlooking the Washington Monument, this 23-story building is already a Skyline maker. We officially opened in June and are eager to offer the best new amenity package in town to our residents. We continue to be excited about the additional value we can deliver in our D.C. portfolio, value that will come from leasing of our existing vacancy, finishing our new residential offerings and offerings that are under construction and building out our development pipeline.

The second thing is, is that we exited the retail, the non-Manhattan retail business for a variety of reasons. We noted several years ago a secular -- not a cyclical, a secular change in retailing patterns. We acted upon that. We exited the mall business entirely, swapping many of the assets for what we thought were better assets. But really -- and then what we decided, we did not want to sell the strip retail business, the Northeast business, which by the way had the Bergen Mall in it, had 2 Puerto Rican malls in it, so it was sort of a little bit of a hybrid. We thought that it was a grand business, and we thought that the right move was to deconglomerate the business and have a very focused, laser-focused management on a smaller business. We seeded the business with a great balance sheet, enough cash to succeed and a very, very engaged board, and we couldn't be more pleased, as I said. The stock price is appropriate. Obviously, it could be a little bit higher, but it's appropriate, nowhere near the discount of Vornado, and we think it has a great future. So that is a very, very interesting template. There has been speculation about that we might do a similar thing with Washington. We're up to our eyeballs in considering that. So that is not -- that's something that is absolutely on the table, and we are absolutely considering. We think that -- interestingly enough, if you take our Washington business -- and I also did say at the beginning of my remarks that Washington is in a slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline, and we do believe that and our numbers show that, by the way. If you look at Washington as a separate segment, which has been beaten up admittedly, and you project out a 4-, 5-, 6-year growth back to normalcy, it is a very high-growth, very interesting business."

We don't want to speculate on what we might do. I've already said very clearly that we are in deep consideration of doing something appropriate with Washington. If you do that, then what we have left is a grand New York business, pound for pound, just a marvelous business with marvelous assets, both on the retail side and the office building side. We believe that the opportunity we have for value creation in the Penn Plaza, Penn Station area is truly unique and is enormous. So that's a unbelievably interesting, exciting business. The strategies of what we might do with it in terms of capital strategies, venture strategies or anything like that, we don't want to -- I don't want to speculate now. Although it is extremely -- it is just a grand business. The other assets that we have, where -- I mean, the Mart business is a wonderful asset, which is in the middle of its value creation career, and 555 California, so the 2 assets that we have that are outlying New York are the best quality in each of those cities. So other than what I've already said, I don't think we should speculate although we couldn't be more excited about the quality and the opportunities of the business we have."

So in total, they are",638,"It's premature, but it's certainly a fair question. So first off, when you think about it, those 2 buildings are giant. One is 1.5 million, 1.6 million square feet. The other one is 2.5 million, 2.6 million, 2.7 million square feet. So in total, they are really -- they're sort of like kissing cousins and they comprise 4.12 million square feet in total. So it's massive, number one. Number two is they sit right on top of the busiest train station in North America. So that's unbelievable. There are no other buildings that share that honor, so to speak. And number three is that they are right in the center, right at the bull's eye of what we call and the marketplace calls the New West Side. So it's a tremendous opportunity. Now having said that, one of the real opportunities is that the buildings are sufficiently large so that the owner of the building -- and they are in one ownership, so there's lots of benefits to that. We can move tenants back and forth between the 2 buildings. If a tenant needs overflow space or expansion space and we don't have it in the building that they are in, we can move -- we can pick that up in an adjacent building, although that's interesting, because the buildings historically are always full. The second thing is we can afford to put an amenity complex into those 4-plus million square foot buildings that are not economic even for 0.5 million or 1 million foot building, which are also large buildings. And the population of those buildings that will be coursing through the spaces is also enormous, and we can put food offerings and even delivery of food into the complexes. So there's lots of different ideas that we have, many of which are being taken from what the tech industry is doing on their big huge campuses. Now in terms of what they're going to cost, they are both going to be co-mingled with improvements which will affect Penn Station and the neighborhood. Now what I mean by that is, is that we are confident that we will -- that the 33rd Street will be closed, and that gives a great opportunity, and both of the buildings front on 33rd Street, to create entrances into the station, to create skylights and light into the stations and what have you. So it's very hard to -- which I've already said we are going to participate in, or at least we're going to participate in this RFP with all of -- enthusiastically and in a huge way. So it's hard to separate them. Now Two Penn, we've already said publicly that our plans are to completely skin the building, to take the skin of the building off and replace it with a new skin, which will have aesthetic consequences, of course; but more importantly than that, it will allow the, what are old-fashioned punched windows to grow to be almost, not quite, but almost floor-to-ceiling windows, which have large breadth and make the building looked like it was built recently, which will enormously increase the market value of the building. The skin will also involve the entrance on Seventh Avenue to Penn Station, which is directly under our building, which is the main entrance to Penn Station. So there is lots of things going on here, which are enormously exciting. The Penn, the One Penn building will be more like in cost a conventional transformation and upgrade that we would do, more expensive because it's twice the size. The Two Penn will be much more expensive because it involves a total re-skinning . So it's too early. It's premature to put a number on that. But I can tell you that we are unbelievably excited about the opportunity."

But generally, I will tell you, as we looked at fourth quarter, the actual activity, as well as everything that we're working on here in the first quarter, I think I used the word our pipeline remained strong, it does -- so I got my leasing guys sitting in lease negotiations round the clock on some very big deals, and what's interesting is a number of those deals that we're working on once again, and I think this is really important, represent expansions by companies in New York. It's not just the musical chair business. As I said, last year, some 750,000-plus square feet of our deals were real growth to the city. What's fascinating is notwithstanding some of the clamor in the financial markets, we really have continued to see the guys that have good businesses, good business platforms continuing to look to grow in the city."

So the first thing is we see no deterioration in the New York Office business. That's step one. What's going to happen 9 months or a year from now, that's another question, and we see no basis upon which to believe that 9 months or a year from now, the New York Office business will be any different than it is today. So that's step one. I mean, obviously, if there's a huge deterioration in the economy, all bets are off, okay? So that's step 1. Step 2 is, is that New York benefits from an enormously diverse business community, and there are at any given time certain sectors which are expanding and certain sectors are contracting. We see no sign that people like Amazon and Facebook or their ilk are doing anything other than full steam ahead and expanding aggressively. So a lot of what happens to the individual companies is a function of the mix of their assets and to which segment of the office market they cater to. So I can only tell you that we stand by our remarks that we think business is good, and we believe that it will continue to be good for the foreseeable future."

The first thing is, I think some -- the secondary assets, I can't vouch for what the pricing is on secondary assets. For prime assets, we see no diminution in pricing. We do see that there are fewer bidders than at the hysterical top of the market, maybe whatever that was, a year ago, or whatever, and so we think that the big thing is that -- and I sort of said this in my remarks, this swoon, I'll call that a swoon for the moment for want of a better word, and the volatility in the capital markets, I believe and most commentators believe, will cause an extension of below-interest-rate, easy-money environment that we have found ourselves in for years and years now. And it's very hard to understand how, with the treasury at 1.8% today, that cap rates can go above go above 4.5%, let's say, into the 5s and 6s. So the interest rate environment and the wall of liquidity, which still exists, is an anchor on keeping pricing firm. The next part of it is, is that it's not random that we and our colleagues operate in New York City, which we consider to be the magnet for both domestic and international capital to invest in real estate. And also, it's when -- history has shown that when there is volatility in the capital markets, after the initial jitters are over, this real estate becomes an extraordinarily important store of value that has over decades and decades. Michael Franco is in the room, who's our Chief Investment Officer. Do you have anything else to add to that?"

So let me just discuss it again. What we did there was it's a 1.1 million square-foot building, which has extraordinary tenants. By the way, it's a mature building, which is my way of saying it's -- basically it's a Wanamaker's department store, so it has enormous floor place, high ceilings, great windows. It's a terrific building in a terrific spot, although it is not anywhere -- it is not by any stretch a new chrome and -- a steel-and-glass building, anyway. So we financed it. We refinanced the $350-odd million loan in the 5s for $700 million, and we did it on a floating-rate basis, and they floated at LIBOR 1.75, and then we swapped the floating rate to fixed. So we have an extensive capital markets team here, and we analyzed every different option in terms of both duration of loan and floating fixed, et cetera. And so we basically have borrowed a -- made it a 5-year fixed loan. It's actually technically a 4.5-year fixed, which is another whole tale. We swapped it for 4.5 years, and the rate is 2.56. Now that's an extraordinary rate for a high-quality building. It's really hard to see how cap rates rise with that kind of finance available. In fact, this may sound crazy to you, cap rates may well decline a little bit. So there you have it."

We do not own the Zara store, which is their flagship store, which is owned by Zara. So we own the retail. The office building, we own half the retail together with a co-venture partner -- I'm sorry, half the office building together with a co-venture partner, the building has a very hefty loan on it. So it's basically almost a -- let me leave it that way, has a very hefty loan. So the partners have been exploring options, which center around the concept that the land unencumbered by building is worth more than the existing assets that are on the building, on the land. Said another way, the highest and best use for that property is not an office building. So there's been lots of exploratory thinking about what is the right thing, the right business plan with that asset. And I think that's where -- it's premature.

So we have external opportunities. We have nothing in mind. And I'd -- we would be -- it's a stretch to even think what would make us wade into this marketplace with heavy debt. Now we turn to internal. Internal is 2 things: our stock and the vast array of internal capital opportunities we have to invest capital at, we believe, high returns in our existing portfolio and with our existing assets and inventory. So those are the options. It's premature to say what we will do. Clearly, we are going to invest internally every single internal project that we have on our plate: Penn Station, the Chelsea buildings, some development in -- limited development in Washington.

Welcome to Vornado's fourth quarter call. I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks are a little long, but be assured",2008,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's fourth quarter call. I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks are a little long, but be assured we will leave plenty of time for Q&A. 
Yesterday, we reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.27 per share, 10.4% better than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our full comparable -- our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, 10.5% better than 2014. If we were to exclude our real estate fund, the increase over 2014 would have been 16.3%.  Our earnings growth was driven by our flagship New York business, and as David will cover shortly, our New York business will continue to produce strong growth in 2015. 
Company-wide, in 2015, we leased 5,381,000 square feet in 483 transactions with overall positive mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 12% cash. In New York, we leased 2,276,000 square feet for the year and 610,000 square feet for the fourth quarter at positive GAAP mark-to-markets of 22.8% for the year and an even higher 25.7% for the fourth quarter. These are great numbers. Mitchell and David will give you details of their businesses shortly. Washington is now a tale of slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline. 
With respect to Penn Plaza, we are delighted that Governor Cuomo has shined a bright light on the importance of Penn Station as New York City's busiest transportation hub and the crying need for improvement. Vornado will be a full participant in this process. The Penn Plaza District, where we are the dominant owner with 9 million square feet, is a great opportunity for us. We are knee-deep in planning multiple projects to transform and enhance our vast Penn Plaza holdings. We are the industry leader in capital programs to reposition and upgrade office and retail assets so as to achieve their full potential. As David will tell you, next up is our grand plan to upgrade, modernize and transform One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza into an integrated 4.2 million square-foot complex sitting directly on top of Penn Station in the center of what has become New York's new West Side. The goal here is to achieve market rents as much as 50% higher than today's rents. 
Almost a year ago, in my letter to shareholders and each -- and in each of our last 3 quarterly calls, I stated that the easy money has been made for this cycle, asset prices are high, well past the 2007 peak. It's a better time to sell than to invest. And most importantly, now is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. To be honest, I didn't expect to be so right so quickly. With many sectors of the economy decelerating, we are experiencing a period of high volatility in both the credit markets and the equity markets. This will, of course, have some effect on the real estate markets. So we have been preparing for all this for whatever is to come. Vornado is buttoned up and ready. Our New York properties are very well leased; we are basically full. Our income stream is diversified, coming from over 1,200 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Our top 10 tenants account for only 13.2% of revenue. It is a testament to the quality of our assets and our leasing machine that Victoria's Secret chose, in a very competitive make-off [ph], to locate their 64,000 square-foot Fifth Avenue flagship with us. Same for Facebook, Amazon, Foot Locker and Neuberger Berman and on and on, you get the picture. 
In this environment, cash is king. Today, we have $4.5 million of immediate -- $4.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and our fully undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. On top of that, we have over $13 billion of highest-quality unencumbered properties. 
Last year in my annual letter to shareholders, on Page 10 if you would like to reread it, I laid out our debt philosophy. Vornado enjoys access to the 4 corners of the capital markets. We prefer secured debt that is recoursed solely to a single property rather than unsecured corporate debt that bears the full faith and credit of the issuer, sort of like a personal guaranty. It is interesting to note that today, secured debt for a sponsor of the standing -- of our standing is both readily available and surprisingly cheaper than the unsecured full faith and credit-type debt. The unsecured and CMBS debt markets are getting a little jumpy. Vornado today has only $850 million of unsecured debt in 2 issues, maturing 4 and 7 years out. 
Vornado is focused and simplified and ready for battle, having sold, spun or pruned over $8.7 billion of assets. True to our word, we have sold much more than we have acquired. Acquisitions have been limited to strategic New York retail properties and creative class value-added office projects. We have pushed the way from acquisitions which were off the fairway, nonstrategic, or most importantly, overpriced. Importantly, we have also significantly upgraded the mix and quality of our assets. For example, trading 1740 Broadway, B office building for the St. Regis retail, 866 UN Plaza for 655 Fifth Avenue retail with Ferragamo store, the Green Acres B+ mall for the retail block at 666 Fifth Avenue and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue for Old Navy on 34th street. 
Three years ago, anticipating secular change, note the current softness in retail and recognizing that with only a handful of malls, we were in no man's land, we decided to exit all non-Manhattan retail. I believe this decision will look better and better and better as each year goes by. 
A word about our shopping center spin, Urban Edge Properties. Celebrating its first anniversary, we couldn't be more delighted with its performance. We created UE by seeding it with our unique, high variant, northeastern shopping center assets. And with our management and staff, we recruited Jeff Olson, a best-in-class CEO, and washed it with a strong balance sheet supported by an experienced and engaged board. Urban Edge is producing the exact result we had expected. And investors, the final report card, are rewarding UE with an appropriate stock price, which, by the way, has held rock solid in the recent months of carnage. And think about it, if the UE assets were still bundled inside Vornado, they probably would be valued at a big discount just like Vornado is. Given the success of UE, the concept of labor -- laser-focused smaller entities may well be a template for the future. 
Our 220 Central Park South supertall residential condominium tower is also buttoned up. It is now 260 feet vertical and visible from Central Park. It will rise at the rate of 1 floor per week. We have dedicated super-low interest rate financing in place, sufficient to fund the entire project. We are over 50% under contract at record-setting pricing, which covers our costs. We will deliver in 2018, and trust me, there will be at least 2 more up-and-down cycles before then. That's sort of a joke. 
As asset values have risen over the cycle, we have pulled back from making loans, especially mezzanine loans. We now have only a couple of small loans left on our books. 
Now if I may, a few words about the New York real estate markets. We see no real hiccups so far in the Class A office market. Vornado's office business continues to perform at very high levels. We do anticipate that decision-makers will take note of the financial volatility and pause, slow down and rethink a little. Of course, we are constantly looking over our shoulders; that's our job. But business continues to be great, so far, so good. David and Mitchell will discuss the health of their markets with you in a moment. My personal favorite, as David will tell you, is that a full 25% of Vornado's New York leasing in 2015 was at rents over $100 per foot. Pretty amazing. I was going to say and they'll move over more, but my team wouldn't let me say it. So I didn't say it. 
Nationwide, retail sales are soft and shopping center traffic has been declining quarter-over-quarter. In Manhattan, as I've said before, momentum investors have driven retail asset prices too high. Landlord asking rents are also too high, exceeding retailer's willingness and ability to pay. Trust me, we are the biggest player in this market by far, and we are in the business of being realistic in terms of pricing and making deals. And at our basis, we sure can. 
Hotels are soft. Just look at the hotel stocks, which are off 1/3 to 1/2. In my mind, the New York hotel industry is the victim of gross cyclical oversupply, even more than the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. New York has added 25,000 rooms in 2010 to a base of 82,000 rooms and -- with 18,000 more rooms under construction, too much supply. And then, of course, there is Airbnb, sort of like what e-shopping is to brick-and-mortar retailing. Interestingly, while people say that the strong dollar is causing a decline in tourism, the numbers show that both domestic and international tourism are holding up just fine. Vornado has a very limited exposure to the hotel market, principally, the Hotel Pennsylvania, which is really a parking lot. 
The for-sale condo business has dramatically slowed at all price points and in all neighborhoods. It's easy to blame the volatility we are now seeing on the financial markets for the buyers' pause, but the slowdown actually started 6 months ago. There seems to be a condo project on every block, most being developed by undercapitalized, over-leveraged players. Vornado's sole exposure to the condo business is our 220 Central Park South project, which is in a class by itself. 
A word about the credit markets, which are becoming a tale of the haves and the have-nots. For sponsors such as Vornado, the credit markets are open at historically low rates. On the other side of the spectrum, for risk assets and less-established sponsors, the credit markets are clogged and choppy. Here's an example I'd like to share with you. Last week, we closed a $700 million, 5-year floating rate loan on 770 Broadway at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which we swapped to fixed at 2.56%. I think 2.56% fixed for what is actually a 4.5 year swap on a $700 million loan is a truly spectacular rate. And by the way, just for reference, that rate is a full 59 basis points better than the rate on a similar loan we closed just 2 months ago. 
It's too early to tell what effect the recent volatility in the financial markets will have on leasing or on asset valuation. My guess is not all that much. We have been long overdue for a correction, and after all, a swoon in economic activity and volatility in the debt and equity markets seem a sure recipe for continued easy money and low interest rates. 
I'll conclude with a listing of our priorities, what we're focusing on and what are proving important in our business. One, buttoning up and focusing on being strong and ready, both financially and in every other way. And by the way, we are beginning to see a few interesting opportunities; two, recognizing the full potential of our vast Penn Plaza assets. Actually, Penn Plaza is a city within a city; and three, closing the gap between our stock price and the true value of our company. By the way, Green Street's NAV for Vornado is $125 a share. 
Thank you for listening. I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share",1270,"Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share last year, also a very strong 10.5% increase. The increase in our comparable FFO in 2015 versus the prior year was clouded by lower gains in 2015 from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund. Excluding this effect, our comparable FFO for the year would have increased 13 -- I'm sorry, 16.3%. Not surprisingly, our growth comes from our large and strong New York business. 
Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the full year was $5.48 per share compared to $4.83 per share for the prior year. Noncomparable FFO items aggregated $19.4 million of income for the fourth quarter compared to $13 million of income for the fourth quarter of last year. 2015 noncomparable items aggregated $123.7 million of income, consisting primarily of a $90 million reversal of an allowance on deferred tax assets of our taxable resubsidiaries and $46.4 million of FFO from the operations of 20 Broad and 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, which we sold. Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on pages 37 and 38 of our annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed summary of noncomparable items. 
Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was $400.7 million, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 9.6%. Our full year comparable EBITDA was $1.533 billion, ahead of last year by 5.9%. Excluding the effect of our real estate fund, our full year comparable EBITDA increased by 8.9%. 
Our New York business produced $283.5 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by a strong $29.2 million or 11.5%. Comparable EBITDA for the New York business was $1.079 billion for the year or 12.2% ahead of 2014. The increases in comparable EBITDA for the quarter and the year were driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service, primarily 7 West 34th, 330 West 34th Street and the Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway; and acquisitions, primarily the St. Regis retail, 150 West 34th Street and the Center building in Long Island city. 
Our New York same-store results are historically industry leading, and we expect to have same-store growth well over 5% in 2016, sequentially higher in the second half than in the first half. When thinking about our earnings in 2016, please keep in mind that we recognized $28 million of onetime income in 2015 from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to the early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel lease at 1650 Madison. While this income is included in our 2015 comparable results, it is not included in our 2015 same-store results. 
Our Washington business produced $79.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, flat to last year's fourth quarter. For the year, Washington's comparable EBITDA was $3.5 million behind last year, on target with our updated guidance. With respect to 2016, we expect that Washington's comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015, comprised of our core Washington business being flat to $4 million higher, offset by occupancy of our Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million and 1726 M and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A trophy office building, decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. 
Now turning to capital markets. In November, we completed an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750 million. The facility is separate and in addition to our $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities and will be used for the specific purpose of funding the construction of our 220 Central Park South luxury condo tower. This facility matures in October 2018 with 2 1-year extension options to 2020. The interest rate is a tight LIBOR plus 115 basis points with a fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing, we draw -- we drew $187.5 million. This facility, together with the in-place $950 million loan, provides funding for all of the costs of the development of 220 Central Park South. 
In December, we completed a $450 million financing of the St. Regis retail located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The loan matures in December 2020 with 2 1-year extension options. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.8% for the first 3 years, LIBOR plus 1.9% for years 4 and 5 and LIBOR plus 2% during the extension periods. 
In December, we completed a $375 million refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, an 882,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.6%, which we'll swap for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 3.15%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $49 million after repaying the existing 5.71%, $319 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in January 2016. 
Last week, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which will swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353 million mortgage, which was scheduled to mature in March 2016. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $708.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million Mart loan, which matures in December 2016, and the $115 million Bowen property loan, which matures in June 2016. We are well along working on these refinancings. Excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South project and including the capital market transactions completed in 2016, our consolidated debt metrics are debt-to-enterprise value of 34%; debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 6.2x; fixed rate debt accounted for 77% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0% and a weighted average term of 5.8 years. 
Our share of 2016 debt maturities of partially owned entities are $736.4 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue; $161 million at the Warner Building; and $138 million at One Park Avenue. We're also well along on working on these refinancings. Including our share of partially owned entities' debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio goes to 7.5x from 6.2x for our consolidated debt. 
Okay. As we disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements, we recognized onetime tax deductions related to the implementation of the tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. These deductions and gains from sales transactions resulted in 100% of our 2015 common dividend being classified as long-term capital gains. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet. Our leverage is modest, and our maturities are well staggered. The vast majority of our debt is conservatively sized property-level secured mortgages. We have a very high-quality portfolio of unencumbered properties. As of -- we have, as of today, $4.5 billion of liquidity comprised of $2 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.5 undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294802,936697,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone.

It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate mar",2761,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to everyone. Before I jump into a review of our business for 2015, I want to step back and spend a few minutes talking about market conditions. It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate market in New York. In a nutshell, I would say that business has been and remains good. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan in 2015 was strong, 28.2 million square feet transacted, the third highest in a decade. At a 9.4% availability rate in Manhattan, the rate was 80 basis points lower at year-end 2015 than 2014. In 2015, 4.5 million square feet of space was absorbed in Manhattan, with Midtown accounting for some 75% of the positive absorption, 3.3 million square feet. We are now 6-plus years into this growth cycle with availability rates having come down by over 340 basis points from 12.8% to the current 9.4%. And during that time period, there was a total absorption of more than 20 million square feet of space in the market. 
Absorption and employment, of course, are directly linked. New York has been an amazing magnet for job growth. From the trough in 2009 August through year-end 2015, private sector employment in New York has gained over 600,000 jobs, over 4x the number of jobs lost in the recession and is now at an all-time record high. In our business, of course, we focus more closely on New York City's office-using employment number, which also has continued to expand, gaining 31,000 jobs in 2015. Since office-using employment bottomed in 2009, New York City has added over 200,000 office-using jobs, double the number of jobs lost, and again, is at an all-time high. While the city's office of management and budget is projecting a lower rate of job growth in 2016 of about 60,000 private sector jobs, that still represents a very healthy growth rate of 1.7%. The city now has a highly diversified local economy with TAMI tenancies, technology, advertising, media and information as well as the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real estate, both driving its strong job growth. As Steve would say, we are no longer a 1-trick financial services pony in New York. 
Let me now turn to our own portfolio. In 2015, in our New York office portfolio, we completed 2.3 million square feet of leasing activity in 165 transactions with a very diverse mix of high-quality tenants across many business sectors. We achieved our highest ever average starting rents of just under $79 per square foot, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 22.8% GAAP and 19.1% cash. Importantly, 32% of our 2.3 million square feet of leasing, some 750,000 square feet, represented tenants new to New York or expanding in New York. Real expansion, real growth. Let me give you some of the names: IPG; the Interpublic Group of Companies; Facebook; AOL; United Talent Agency; PJT Partners; FactSet, PPG; Foot Locker; Parsons Brinckerhoff; and GIC, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. 
As many of the brokerage firms have noted, in 2015, the FIRE sector reemerged as the top driver of leasing with nearly 1/3 of overall activity. That move back to finance and the boutique asset management and private equity firms has had a notable impact at the high end of the marketplace. In a $100-plus per square foot marketplace, citywide in 2015, 138 leases were executed. We completed 28 of those leases, a 20% market share, for a total, as Steve had mentioned, of 400 -- 544,000 square feet, which was 25% of our total leasing activity. Think about it. With less than a 5% market share, we did 20% of the triple-digit deals in the market and more than any other landlord, spread in 6 of our trophy buildings: 650 Madison Avenue; 888 Seventh Avenue; 350 Park Avenue; 280 Park Avenue; 640 Fifth Avenue; and 770 Broadway, all at average starting rents of $108 per square foot. This certainly speaks to the quality of our assets. 
I might also add that while historically, the $100- plus per square foot marketplace had been limited to small space users, last year, we completed 2 of the 4 largest triple-digit leases in the city: one, with a private equity firm at 888 Seventh Avenue for 93,000 square feet; and the other with a tech company at 770 Broadway for 80,000 square feet. 
Let me now quickly turn to the fourth quarter. We completed over 600,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter at average starting rents of $75 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 25.7% GAAP and 22.4% cash. Our year-end occupancy was 96.3%. We remain basically full. 
A couple of highlights for the quarter. In Penn Plaza, at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed an 82,000 square-foot lease with Structure Tone, which will join this building's diverse tenant roster of Foot Locker, Deutsch Advertising, Yodle and New York & Company. With this deal, the building is now 90% leased up. We actually moved Structure Tone, our tenant at 770 Broadway, to 330 West 34th Street to free up to lease an additional floor in 770 Broadway to AOL, which is now owned by Verizon and in a growth mode. AOL now occupies a total of 308,000 square feet in 770 Broadway. At 100 West 33rd Street, the office portion of the Manhattan Mall, we took back a floor from Rocket Fuel, which was looking to downsize, and immediately leased the space to IPG, which now occupies a total of 607,000 square feet in the building for its ad groups Mediabrands, FCB and Initiative. We also entered into important renewal leases with Fidelity Investments at 640 Fifth Avenue for 41,000 square feet and a law firm at 909 Third Avenue for 65,000 square feet. And finally, a renewal expansion with United Talent Agency at 888 Seventh Avenue for 43,000 square feet. 
Our activity at the start of 2016 remains strong. At 770, just last week, we signed an 80,000 square-foot expansion with Facebook, which has now grown to 355,000 square feet at 770 from its initial occupancy of 98,000 square feet in May 2013. We have a strong leasing pipeline of 1,350,000 square feet. This includes over 550,000 square feet in active lease documentation and another 800,000 square feet of leases in advanced discussions. 
With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, our lease expirations for the balance of 2016 are a modest 800,000 square feet, our normal run rate. And as we look out to 2017 and 2018, the expirations are around 1 million square feet a year with no one tenant representing more than 150,000 square feet. 
Over the last 3 years, we have completed a string of major building redevelopment, repositioning 7 buildings, a total of 6.4 million square feet. Our portfolio is in great shape. We transformed both 7 West 34th Street, bringing in Amazon to lease virtually the entire building, and 330 West 34th Street into 1.2 million square feet of creative class space. With its full block lobby, mid-block jewel box atrium and new curtain wall, 280 Park Avenue with JP Morgan Chase as our direct next-door neighbor, is now one of the best buildings on Park Avenue, attracting best-in-class boutique financial firms. At 1290 Avenue of the Americas and at 330 Madison Avenue, we executed dramatic building renovations and landed Neuberger Berman at 1290 and Guggenheim Partners at 330 as the building's signature tenant. And we are now in the final stages of completing our program at 90 Park Avenue, attracting both traditional financial service firms as well as the creative types. We would be happy to take you on a tour of our portfolio to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the dramatic public spaces. Call Cathy. My development and leasing teams are enormously proud of what we have accomplished and enjoy showing off our assets. 
With the completion of these renovation programs, you may be asking yourselves, so what's next? Of course, there is Penn Plaza. This is the submarket, whose time has now come. Last month, Governor Cuomo unveiled an ambitious infrastructure plan for New York State, including an array of downstate transportation projects: A new cross Hudson rail tunnel, an addition of a third track to a portion of the Long Island railroad; a train to La Guardia Airport and more. It's an impressive array of projects. And most importantly, as the governor stated, Penn Station, and I'm now quoting, ""Penn Station will be the nexus for all this increased capacity, doubling the traffic through Penn Station over the next 15 years."" That is very, very good news for our 9 million square feet of holdings in Penn Plaza. 
While our Penn Plaza assets have, for the better part of 20 years, been fully leased, rents remain substantially below what we believe these buildings can achieve, given their unmatched access to transportation and their location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. We see a tremendous opportunity to reposition these assets, in line with what we have done elsewhere in the city. Consider for a moment just 1 Penn and 2 Penn Plaza, 2 buildings that sit directly on top of and have access to Penn Station without ever stepping outside. These are buildings that represent a significant value creation opportunity. Our team continues to advance plan to turn these 2 buildings into a massive 4.2 million square foot Penn Plaza complex, fully modernized with shared amenity spaces integrated both above and below ground. When you consider our other development opportunities in the district, it's easy to see why Steve describes Penn Plaza as the Big Kahuna. 
For a glimpse into the future of the area, be sure to stop in for a bite at the new Pennsy. It's a food hall we recently created in 2 Penn Plaza at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Spend a few minutes enjoying a meal and a cocktail, or wait until the weather gets a bit warmer and we open up the rolltop garage doors onto Plaza33. As you know, last year, we implemented a temporary closure of 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue to create a public amenity called Plaza33. The Plaza earned rave reviews from the press, elected officials and the local community. We continue to work with the city and the local community board and are hopeful that Plaza33 will return later this year as a permanent year-round feature. I hope you will stop by. 
Another answer to the question of what's next is our growing beachhead in the West Chelsea district. At 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street and 512 West 22nd Street right on the High Line, we have partnered to develop ground up, 2 new boutique office buildings. Also at 260 Eleventh Avenue, we have the opportunity to totally redevelop and expand an asset we acquired in an off-market transaction. When you consider where these assets are located and the quality of the architecture, you will see that these buildings will be the trophy assets of the future. 
Let me now turn to our important Manhattan street retail portfolio, where, as you know, in 2015, we signed the 3 largest leases in the market, all on Fifth Avenue: A 64,000 square-foot flagship with Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue; and 2 leases with Swatch for its luxury brands; and for Harry Winston at the St. Regis retail. The aggregate starting rents for these leases are $70 million. Think about it. The rent coming out of these 3 retail leases
[Audio Gap]
million square foot office building. We delivered possession of the 640 space to Victoria's Secret on February 1, and both Swatch spaces have now been delivered. Revenue recognition on a GAAP basis has now commenced. In total, for the year 2015, we completed 20 retail leases with positive mark-to-markets of 99% GAAP, a 2 multiple; and 149% cash, a 2.5 multiple. We have good activity on our remaining spaces at 1535 as well as the 3200 square foot store we carved out of 640 with 25 feet of frontage. 
I'll touch only briefly on the Mart in River North in Chicago, since I spent quite a bit of time on the transformation of this iconic asset on our last call. For the year, we leased more than 750,000 square feet in 86 transactions, including headquarters relocations for ConAgra Foods and Allstate and expansions by PayPal, Yelp and the prominent technology incubator, 1871, all at average positive mark-to-markets of 25.3% GAAP and 20.5% cash. This monumental 3.6 million square-foot asset is 98.5% leased. We are well into our 40-plus million dollar redevelopment program to add state-of-the-art amenities to the Mart, a grand stair with stadium seating for our tenants to congregate, including a presentation venue, and bringing new life to the first 2 floors of the building as well as trendsetting food options and a reimagined food hall. We could not be happier with the performance of this asset. 
On to San Francisco. 2015 was a relatively quiet leasing year for us in San Francisco, where our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California Street property is an iconic part of the skyline. After a very active 2013 and 2014, when we leased over 900,000 square feet at the property, in 2015, we leased a total of 98,000 square feet at average starting rents in excess of $83 per square foot and at positive cash mark-to-markets of 34.8%. While the tower at 555 California is fully leased at an occupancy rate of 98.4%, in the fourth quarter, Bank of America, as expected, vacated the old banking hall at 345 Montgomery Street as well as the space it occupied in the adjacent 315 Montgomery Street building, a total of about 200,000 square feet. We are currently prepping the space with exposed brick walls and open-plan space for today's creative class of tenants and introduced the space to the marketplace with a broker event in the building just last week. We remain very constructive on the San Francisco market. 
Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same-store numbers for the New York business for 2015 were a positive 2.4% GAAP and 1.3% cash. And for the fourth quarter, the same-store numbers were positive 1.4% GAAP and negative 4.4% cash. As we have said over the course of the year, these numbers are not reflective of the real growth in operating results for the New York division. 
I want to pause here a minute and talk about the negative same-store numbers for the fourth quarter. This is really important, and I want to go over these numbers carefully. In the fourth quarter of 2015, just in our New York office business, there was a 10% swing in the difference between our GAAP and our cash same-store numbers. GAAP same-store for the office business was a positive 3.7%, and cash same-store was a negative 6.1%. This is an unusual occurrence, which is attributable to the free-rent periods on the extraordinary amount of leasing that we completed in 2014, some 4.2 million square feet. 
Regarding the 2015 GAAP same-store results, as I've said in our previous calls, the tepid growth numbers reflect a dip in occupancy attributable to the redevelopment of 90 Park Avenue as well as the downtime in connection with the redevelopment of the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue for Victoria's Secret and the retail space we took back from Crate & Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. 2015's real growth came from placing our out-of-service properties, 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway, back into service, which contributed a total of $47 million of EBITDA growth, not reflected in our same-store results. And importantly, as Steve Theriot said earlier, our New York same-store results historically have been industry-leading and we fully expect same-store growth in our New York business to be back to well over 5% in 2016. 
Let me conclude. It was a strong year in New York for both the market and Vornado, and we believe we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of leasing activity. With a diverse employer base and a large talent pool, there is no place where we would rather be. And we're confident that the quality and location of our buildings, our team and our relationships in the marketplace will enable us to outperform the marketplace in any environment in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."
312648,318294802,936697,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen.

In 2015, the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion, and all economic indicators signal that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 2014 to over 68,000 new jobs in 2015. Importantly, 48% of this growth was in office-using sectors with 32,900 new jobs. The passage of the 2-year federal budget has had a broad stabilizing effect on the local economy. And on the ground, the green shoots are sprouting a bit. We saw a pick-up in leasing activity and tours throughout 2015. Specifically, in our Washington portfolio, as we expected, our 2015 comparable EBITDA was down about $3.5 million from 2014. As Steve Theriot said earlier, in 2016, we expect EBITDA from our core Washington business will be flat to $4 million higher than 2015. However, that growth will be offset by 2 items: first, we expect occupancy of our Skyline properties to decline further, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $6.5 million; second, we will be vacating and taking 1726 M and 1150 17th Street out of service, which will decrease EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. This spring, we will demolish these 2 obsolete buildings in preparation for the development in the future of a new state-of-the-art trophy office building, 1700 M, in the heart of the Central Business District. So summing it all up, we expect that Washington's 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me take a minute now to review our 2015 results. In 2015, we leased a lot of space, over 2.1 million square feet in 216 deals at an initial average cash rent of $40.20 per square foot. About 1/3 of our 2015 leases were new and expanding tenants, and the other 2/3 were renewals. We ended the year with office occupancy of 82.1%, an increase of 140 basis points over year-end 2014. Skyline fell to 50.1% occupancy by year-end, down 340 basis points from 2014, an obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our office occupancy at year-end was 89.9%, an improvement of 250 basis points over 2014.  Our Crystal City occupancy at year-end was 89.5%, an improvement of 430 basis points over 2014. On the residential side, we own 2,400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with a year-end occupancy of 96.1%. 
Focusing specifically on the fourth quarter for a moment, we leased 450,000 square feet, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 0.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.7%, a result we are pleased with, given the competition that exists for every lease. 
Our fourth quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 11.5% of initial rents or $5.06 per square foot per annum, trending lower than the prior quarters in 2015.
Now let's turn specifically to Crystal City and Pentagon City. In 2015, we executed 1.1 million square feet of office leases in Crystal City. Crystal City is starting to gain traction, as noted in several local brokerage reports. JLL cited that Crystal City led all other submarkets in the region in net absorption last year. Those deals were predominantly done by us. 
Cushman & Wakefield's recent market presentation referenced Crystal City's comeback and noted that Crystal City is doing what it takes to win big deals with 1.3 million square feet leased in 2015. Notably, in Q4, we executed a 35,000 square-foot lease with an insurance company, Dominion National, at 251 18th Street. And at the same building, we recently completed a 53,000 square-foot lease with Kumonix, an international development company. This 300,000 square-foot building, which was completely vacated by BRAC tenants, is now 95% leased. Also in Crystal City, 2221 South Clark Street, another office building previously vacated by defense agencies, has just reopened as WeWork's first location in Northern Virginia. In addition to our partnership with WeWork downtown in our Dupont Circle building, we now together converted this building into 216 collaborative-living, community-style apartments as well as 2 floors of WeWork co-working office space. The office portion opened on February 1. It looks great, and it's already 60% occupied. The residential units will be open in the spring. We're excited to add this important layer to the Crystal City fabric and look forward to welcoming fresh new faces to our community. 
Overall, we've now resolved or have pending about 74% of the original 2.4 million square feet of space vacated by BRAC tenants. We have 630,000 square feet left to resolve, and 412,000 square feet of that is in Skyline. In Crystal City, we have taken care of close to 90% or 1.3 million square feet of the original 1.4 million square feet of the BRAC space. We replaced BRAC tenants with a diverse array of associations, professional services and tech innovators, steadily changing the complexion and the demographics in Crystal City. 
We continue to change the street-level experience as well. Just last week, Sweetgreen, a local millennial favorite, opened its doors on Crystal Drive. Sweetgreen, Taylor Gourmet and Earth Treks, our new indoor climbing gym, are just a few of the new retailers who are bringing a fresh flavor of destination food and activity to Crystal City. We're also changing the physical experience. We recently received approval from Arlington County to begin redeveloping the building that will be vacated by the U.S. Marshals at the end of this year. Located on Crystal Drive, at the Metro, the newly rebranded 1770 Crystal Drive will be fully repositioned with a new skin, new lobby, new systems, new retail and a top floor conference center for delivery in early 2018. The building will be surrounded by restaurants and entertainment, adding to the street vitality. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we just kicked off preleasing on our new 699-unit apartment project, the Bartlett. Located directly atop the new Whole Foods and overlooking the Washington Monument, this 23-story building is already a Skyline maker. We officially opened in June and are eager to offer the best new amenity package in town to our residents. We continue to be excited about the additional value we can deliver in our D.C. portfolio, value that will come from leasing of our existing vacancy, finishing our new residential offerings and offerings that are under construction and building out our development pipeline. 
I want to thank you all, and I'd like to the turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The second thing is, is that we exited the retail, the non-Manhattan retail business for a variety of reasons. We noted several years ago a secular -- not a cyclical, a secular change in retailing patterns. We acted upon that. We exited the mall business entirely, swapping many of the assets for what we thought were better assets. But really -- and then what we decided, we did not want to sell the strip retail business, the Northeast business, which by the way had the Bergen Mall in it, had 2 Puerto Rican malls in it, so it was sort of a little bit of a hybrid. We thought that it was a grand business, and we thought that the right move was to deconglomerate the business and have a very focused, laser-focused management on a smaller business. We seeded the business with a great balance sheet, enough cash to succeed and a very, very engaged board, and we couldn't be more pleased, as I said. The stock price is appropriate. Obviously, it could be a little bit higher, but it's appropriate, nowhere near the discount of Vornado, and we think it has a great future. So that is a very, very interesting template. There has been speculation about that we might do a similar thing with Washington. We're up to our eyeballs in considering that. So that is not -- that's something that is absolutely on the table, and we are absolutely considering. We think that -- interestingly enough, if you take our Washington business -- and I also did say at the beginning of my remarks that Washington is in a slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline, and we do believe that and our numbers show that, by the way. If you look at Washington as a separate segment, which has been beaten up admittedly, and you project out a 4-, 5-, 6-year growth back to normalcy, it is a very high-growth, very interesting business."

The other one is 2.5 million, 2.6 million, 2.7 million square feet. So in total, they are really -- they're sort of like kissing cousins and they comprise 4.12 million square feet in total. So it's massive, number one. Number two is they sit right on top of the busiest train station in North America. So that's unbelievable. There are no other buildings that share that honor, so to speak. And number three is that they are right in the center, right at the bull's eye of what we call and the marketplace calls the New West Side. So it's a tremendous opportunity. Now having said that, one of the real opportunities is that the buildings are sufficiently large so that the owner of the building -- and they are in one ownership, so there's lots of benefits to that. We can move tenants back and forth between the 2 buildings. If a tenant needs overflow space or expansion space and we don't have it in the building that they are in, we can move -- we can pick that up in an adjacent building, although that's interesting, because the buildings historically are always full. The second thing is we can afford to put an amenity complex into those 4-plus million square foot buildings that are not economic even for 0.5 million or 1 million foot building, which are also large buildings. And the population of those buildings that will be coursing through the spaces is also enormous, and we can put food offerings and even delivery of food into the complexes. So there's lots of different ideas that we have, many of which are being taken from what the tech industry is doing on their big huge campuses. Now in terms of what they're going to cost, they are both going to be co-mingled with improvements which will affect Penn Station and the neighborhood. Now what I mean by that is, is that we are confident that we will -- that the 33rd Street will be closed, and that gives a great opportunity, and both of the buildings front on 33rd Street, to create entrances into the station, to create skylights and light into the stations and what have you. So it's very hard to -- which I've already said we are going to participate in, or at least we're going to participate in this RFP with all of -- enthusiastically and in a huge way. So it's hard to separate them. Now Two Penn, we've already said publicly that our plans are to completely skin the building, to take the skin of the building off and replace it with a new skin, which will have aesthetic consequences, of course; but more importantly than that, it will allow the, what are old-fashioned punched windows to grow to be almost, not quite, but almost floor-to-ceiling windows, which have large breadth and make the building looked like it was built recently, which will enormously increase the market value of the building. The skin will also involve the entrance on Seventh Avenue to Penn Station, which is directly under our building, which is the main entrance to Penn Station. So there is lots of things going on here, which are enormously exciting. The Penn, the One Penn building will be more like in cost a conventional transformation and upgrade that we would do, more expensive because it's twice the size. The Two Penn will be much more expensive because it involves a total re-skinning . So it's too early. It's premature to put a number on that. But I can tell you that we are unbelievably excited about the opportunity."

So the first thing is we see no deterioration in the New York Office business. That's step one. What's going to happen 9 months or a year from now, that's another question, and we see no basis upon which to believe that 9 months or a year from now, the New York Office business will be any different than it is today. So that's step one. I mean, obviously, if there's a huge deterioration in the economy, all bets are off, okay? So that's step 1. Step 2 is, is that New York benefits from an enormously diverse business community, and there are at any given time certain sectors which are expanding and certain sectors are contracting. We see no sign that people like Amazon and Facebook or their ilk are doing anything other than full steam ahead and expanding aggressively. So a lot of what happens to the individual companies is a function of the mix of their assets and to which segment of the office market they cater to.

We do see that there are fewer bidders than at the hysterical top of the market, maybe whatever that was, a year ago, or whatever, and so we think that the big thing is that -- and I sort of said this in my remarks, this swoon, I'll call that a swoon for the moment for want of a better word, and the volatility in the capital markets, I believe and most commentators believe, will cause an extension of below-interest-rate, easy-money environment that we have found ourselves in for years and years now. And it's very hard to understand how, with the treasury at 1.8% today, that cap rates can go above go above 4.5%, let's say, into the 5s and 6s. So the interest rate environment and the wall of liquidity, which still exists, is an anchor on keeping pricing firm. The next part of it is, is that it's not random that we and our colleagues operate in New York City, which we consider to be the magnet for both domestic and international capital to invest in real estate. And also, it's when -- history has shown that when there is volatility in the capital markets, after the initial jitters are over, this real estate becomes an extraordinarily important store of value that has over decades and decades.

So let me just discuss it again. What we did there was it's a 1.1 million square-foot building, which has extraordinary tenants. By the way, it's a mature building, which is my way of saying it's -- basically it's a Wanamaker's department store, so it has enormous floor place, high ceilings, great windows. It's a terrific building in a terrific spot, although it is not anywhere -- it is not by any stretch a new chrome and -- a steel-and-glass building, anyway. So we financed it. We refinanced the $350-odd million loan in the 5s for $700 million, and we did it on a floating-rate basis, and they floated at LIBOR 1.75, and then we swapped the floating rate to fixed. So we have an extensive capital markets team here, and we analyzed every different option in terms of both duration of loan and floating fixed, et cetera. And so we basically have borrowed a -- made it a 5-year fixed loan. It's actually technically a 4.5-year fixed, which is another whole tale. We swapped it for 4.5 years, and the rate is 2.56. Now that's an extraordinary rate for a high-quality building. It's really hard to see how cap rates rise with that kind of finance available. In fact, this may sound crazy to you, cap rates may well decline a little bit. So there you have it."

We do not own the Zara store, which is their flagship store, which is owned by Zara. So we own the retail. The office building, we own half the retail together with a co-venture partner -- I'm sorry, half the office building together with a co-venture partner, the building has a very hefty loan on it. So it's basically almost a -- let me leave it that way, has a very hefty loan. So the partners have been exploring options, which center around the concept that the land unencumbered by building is worth more than the existing assets that are on the building, on the land. Said another way, the highest and best use for that property is not an office building. So there's been lots of exploratory thinking about what is the right thing, the right business plan with that asset. And I think that's where -- it's premature.

Internal is 2 things: our stock and the vast array of internal capital opportunities we have to invest capital at, we believe, high returns in our existing portfolio and with our existing assets and inventory. So those are the options. It's premature to say what we will do. Clearly, we are going to invest internally every single internal project that we have on our plate: Penn Station, the Chelsea buildings, some development in -- limited development in Washington. Every single one of those will get its fair share of capital and will be done. Anything else is discretionary, and it's premature."

Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco, the 3.7 million square-foot market in Chicago all of our office residential and development properties in Washington a couple of billion dollars of cash and much more. But the main event here at Vornado is our New York office and our dominant New York speed retail business. And that business having -- has industry-leading asset quality, it's performing at very high levels and is growing like crazy. The road here is organic, the most profitable kind, coming from our existing assets where taxes and operating expenses are already a thin so that substantially all of each dollar of incremental revenue falls right to the bottom line. And this growth requires us to spend only TIs and leasing commissions of $100 per square foot, which is a small fraction of the capital required to buy or build in New York, which might cost $1,000 or $1,500 or even $2,000 per square foot. And none of this growth is yet transparent to the market. So here's the math. Over the past 2 years, we did 7.1 million square feet at share of leasing in New York at the market in at 555 California Street. 2.3 million -- which is 2.3 million square feet higher than our 2-year average. As of today, from this leasing, we had $200 million plus of incremental additive cash NOI on deck not yet in our numbers, which will be recognized between now and 2018 as follows. $41 million in the remainder of this year $120 million in 2017 and another $39 million in 2018, all from signed leases, which have not yet commenced paying cash rent. The breakdown is $123 million from New York office, $57 million from New York street retail and $20 million from the mark and 555 California Street. These are not projections. All of this is from signed leases from tenants such as PWC at 90 Park Avenue, Newberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the America, Facebook at AOL Verizon at 777 Broadway, Amazon at 7 West 34th Street, Macy's at 1110, Foot Locker and structure at 330 West 34th Street Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenues watch Harry Winston and St. Regis can at the mark and many, many others. The equivalent GAAP increment that has yet to come into income over that period is $83 million. 
As you know, GAAP rent recognition commences earlier than cash rent recognition due to free rent periods. Importantly, because NAV, the principal measure of value is calculated based on cash NOI, this additional $200 million increment will increase our NAV by a very meaningful $20 to $25 per share, depending upon the cap rate one uses. for those of you are in the modeling business, our internal budget showed 2017 cash NOI from our New York Office and street retail plus the mark in 555 California is about $1.1 billion, give or take. As a point of reference, 2015 was $900 million. That's $1.1 billion in 2017 versus $900 million already booked in the year 2015. You should note that I will, of course, have leases that will expire during these periods, and all the leasing activity which could positively or negatively affect on both NOI and EBITDA. 
Now to the quarter. Our comparable FFO was $1.08 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.07 for last year's first quarter. Our New York business produced $14.9 million of comparable EBITDA growth or $0.08 per share even after being penalized by $5.1 million noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable for early lease terminations we initiated to make way for replacement leases at 20-plus mark-to-markets. Excluding that straight-line write-off, growth was $20 million or $0.10 per share. The New York business produced a 5.5% same-store increase. 
Focusing on the entire company, the way we look at it, the Washington business declined by an unexpected $5 million, of which negative $2.1 million is from increasing vacancy at Skyline and properties taken out of service and negative $2.9 million is from the core, all on track with our guidance. The fair value earnings of our real estate fund declined by $5.2 million quarter-over-quarter. As you know, the fund is in harvest phase and continues to shrink all unplanned. And we are carrying $1.9 billion of cash, $900 million more than the prior year's quarter, and that has a quarterly opportunity for cost $0.05 per share. Adjusting for these items, our pro forma comparable FFO per share would've been $0.10 higher, a 9.3% increase from the prior year's quarter. 
Now to other businesses. On April 22, a little over a week ago, we submitted 2 comprehensive proposals in response to the state's RFP and RFPI, one for the quality building in partnership with the related companies at Skanska and a second on our own for Penn Station. We welcome whatever the hook on Penn Station and the Penn Plaza District. We were the early mover in Penn Plaza. We have accumulated 9 million square feet here in the very heart of Manhattan's new West Side. And as I said repeatedly, Penn Plaza is Vornado's Big Kahuna. 
At 220 Central Park South, our 4 [ph] sale condo project traffic has picked up in the sales, benefiting from the rising building now being very clearly visible from Central Park, and the call may off the financial -- the global financial markets. We continue to explore separating the Washington business. And we have begun a process to disclose of the Skyline profit -- properties, which are subject to $678 million mortgage loan. At our request, loan has been transferred to the special service. Consequently, based on our shortening estimated holding -- shortened estimated holding period, we recognized the $160.7 million noncash impairment loss in this quarter. 
Now to leasing. The company in the first quarter we leased 1,403,000 square feet in 106 separate transactions. In New York, we leased 737,000 square feet of office space at starting rents of $84.32 and positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% cap and 28.2% cash. Business in New York is really good. 
And asset pricing in New York continues to set records. Here are 2 examples hot off the press. First, the 50-front [ph] foot Valentino flagship on upper Fifth Avenue midblock between 54th and 55th Street on the east side has just contract to a European high net worth individual. We hear the prices $525 million, well through the $480 million asking price, which equates to $11.3 million per retail front foot. Vornado was the balance of this block. Boatloads of the Valentino property, including both corners consisting of the St. Regis retail is 100-front feet and 689 Fifth Avenue with 50 front feet, which gives us a total of 150-front feet on this superpremium block, which I guess based upon the comp is now worth for sure well over $1.5 billion. This sale certainly validates upper Fifth Avenue values. 2 years ago in my annual message to shareholders pages 14 and 15, if you would like to look it up, I provided a numerical tour of upper Fifth Avenue values. We own 20% of the retail frontage on upper Fifth, including stores for Victoria's Secret, Ferragamo, Swatch, Harry Vinson, Mac cosmetics, Unico, Hollister, et cetera. The second reason sale of note, the Sony building 550 Madison Avenue at 56 Street coincidentally just behind the St. Regis has also just gotten the contract to a high net worth Middle Eastern family for $1,800 a foot. The seller plans for a residential conversion. The building will be delivered vacant intended for high-end office use. These 2 noteworthy sales both involving high net worth individuals not countries, not sovereign wealth funds, not pension plans are like further validate the strength of New York, the enormous liquidity in the marketplace and the global appeal of prime New York real estate. It's important to note that these 2 assets are very high quality. And by the way, I can't resist to plug our portfolio is filled with assets of equivalent value -- equivalent quality. This is season. Our Annual Shareholders Meeting is May 19. This year, we have modernized our governance to conform with the best practices. Special thanks to Candace Reineke, our Corporate Governance Committee Chair, who has led the charge here and has now taken on the additional responsibility of lead trustee. Thank you to Candace. 
To sum it up, business is really good. We're excited to be putting up growth numbers from our on deck leases, and our highest priorities are Washington, and to dig in and get to work in Penn Plaza. Now over to Steve Theriot."

Steve covered our financial results so I will limit my comments to a couple of items. I want to highlight 2 items that will affect the quarterly comparison of our New York business growth in comparable EBITDA and FFO for the remainder of 2016. First, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized $27 million of noncash nonrecurring income from the acceleration of Fast 141 below market leases relating to our early termination of the leases at the St. Regis property and the Barrel leases at 650 Madison. Second, during the remainder of 2016, we will write off straight line rent receivable balances totaling $9.7 million triggered by our early termination of leases with J.Crew and Rocket Fuel, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for that space with mark-to-markets of 20-plus percent GAAP and cash. Was write-off of straight-line receivable balances will reduce EBITDA in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective, increasing future EBITDA. Together, these 2 non-cash adjustments to recapture and relet space at much higher rents will negatively affect the quarterly comparison of our growth in our New York businesses comparable EBITDA and FFO in the second quarter of 2016 by $11.3 million, the third quarter by $12.5 million and the fourth quarter by $12.9 million. We reaffirm our guidance to the comparable EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Now turning to capital markets. In March, we completed a $300 million refinancing of One Park Avenue, a 947,000 square-foot Manhattan office building in which we own a 55% interest. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $45 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 4.99% fixed rate $250 million loan. 
In February, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 [ph] square-foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which will swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65% fixed rate $353 million loan. Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $709 million, consisting primarily a $550 million Mart loan which matures in December 2016; our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $697 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue and $161 million at the Warner Building. We are well along on these refinancings and expect to close the Warner Building refinancing in a couple of days. 
Excluding the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self-liquidate from signed sales contracts, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed rate debt accounted for 77% with a weighted average debt of 3.99% and a weighted average term of 4.8 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.18% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years. 
Debt-to-enterprise value is 31%. Debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 7.5x. Pro forma, excluding debt related to Skyline, which has recently transferred to the special servicer and using, say, $1 billion of excess cash to reduce debt our pro forma consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio strengthens to 6.3x. 
In addition, including our share of partially owned entities debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our pro forma debt -- total debt-to-EBITDA ratio encapsulated on the same basis increases to 7.0x from 6.3x. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress of balance sheet with modest leverage in our maturities are well staggered. We have, as of today, 4.4 million indiscernible] $1.9 billion of cash and restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.5 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294845,971155,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time",1968,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time record highs. In the first quarter, the Manhattan leasing markets continued to perform well as the city's highly diversified economy continues to create tenant demand across all industries and submarkets. Despite global volatility, the overall leasing market remains resilient with first quarter leasing volume better than 8 million square feet, which included 10 large-block transactions comprised of balanced mix of financial services, TAMI and professional business services tenancies. Asking rents in Midtown continued increase quarter-over-quarter having now eclipsed the $80 per square foot mark. The overall availability rate continues to hover around 10%. Importantly, which includes sublet availability, which is now down to a nominal 1.5%, representing the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2008. 
New York City's job growth continues to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 With total private sector employment growth of 24,200 jobs, including 7,100 office using jobs, both on par with the strong job creation we realized in 2015. And by the way, these are actual reported job growth numbers, not seasonally adjusted. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, ""Companies flock to cities with top talent, and New York continues to be a top magnet for top talent."" I will repeat what I said last quarter: Business has been and remains very good. 
Let me now turn to our own office portfolio. During the first quarter, we completed 737,000 square feet of leasing activity and 36 transactions. This quarter's average starting rents reached $84.32 per square foot with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. I might add that even if you exclude one large lease extension we executed this quarter as starting rents would still be over $79 per square foot in our mark-to-markets would be over 30% GAAP and 28% cash. Our quarter ending office occupancy was 96.4%. We remain full. And reflecting on the city's continuing healthy job growth, I would note that of the 737,000 square feet we leased in the first quarter, fully 41% of the activity was comprised of tenants expanding their footprint in New York in our case, attributable to 2 significant leases I'll talk about in a minute PWC PricewaterhouseCoopers and Facebook. In anticipation of the scheduled expiration of this space formerly occupied by big pharma companies Sterling Winthrop and Sanofi at 90 Park Avenue, during 2015, we completed a significant $70 million redevelopment of the building, which has been extremely well received by the marketplace. As we reposition and transform buildings in our portfolio, time and time again, we successfully have attracted large credited quarter tenants. Newberger Berman at 1296 Avenue, Guggenheim in 330 Madison Avenue, Amazon in 7 West 34th Street, PJT Partners and Franklin Templeton Investments at 280 Park Avenue, Foot Locker and Deutsch Advertising in 330 West 34th Street, Facebook and AOL Verizon in 770 Broadway and on and on. And this quarter's leasing highlight was our 241,000 square-foot headquarters lease with PWC at 90 Park Avenue. PWC is the largest professional services firm in the world. And this new lease is pure expansion for PWC, creating a campus-like environment for its New York workforce in close proximity to its present office at 300 Madison Avenue. This was a competitive deal, and we are delighted that PWC selected 90 Park Avenue as its second headquarters location in New York. The transformation at 90 Park Avenue has totally modernized infrastructure of this asset as well as dramatically reimagining the aesthetic of the building to attract both the millennial generation note here that 80% of PWC's New York workforce are millennials as well as the more traditional financial services tenants. In this 950,000 square foot Class A property, in the past year, we have leased 540,000 square feet and have an additional lease out for signature of another 120,000 square feet, bringing the building to 93% occupancy, all at robust mark-to-markets of 25% GAAP and 20% cash. We have now secured 3 major tenants in the building: PWC, FactSet at the national law firm Foley and Lardner, along with a concentration of boutique, financial services tenants will occupy the mid-rise and tower of the building, including UV in, Ever Bank, A and the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Speaking to the quality of our New York portfolio, in the quarter, we continued to outperform the market is it relates to deals of $100 per square foot or greater. We executed 6 leases this quarter totaling 340,000 square feet, with starting rents averaging $116 per square foot. Driving these numbers, level 3 renewed its 60,000 square-foot lease at 85 10th Avenue, Facebook added another 80,000 square feet at our 220 Broadway we were able to recapture a below market lease in order to satisfy Facebook's ever-growing need for space. And Bloomberg extended its lease in the tower office floors at 731 Lexington Avenue to 2029 to be coterminous with its 700,000 square-foot main lease. 
In our retail portfolio, during the first quarter, we completed 38,000 square feet of leasing activity in 7 transactions. The highlight of the quarter was our 20,000 square-foot lease with Starbucks for its new reserve roastery and using concept, which will be Starbucks largest outlet in the world, modeled on the concept story of that debuted in the company's hometown of Seattle 2 years ago. Even we were surprised by the worldwide business press this lease received. 
Looking for the perfect location to open the second outpost of its high-end brand, Starbucks after an extensive process, selected our development site at 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street because of its close proximity to the Chelsea Market, Google's offices, the Apple Store and the High Line. We broke ground on the 61 Ninth development just a few weeks ago, and we will be delivering the iconic 170,000 square-foot building designed by Raphael by the end of the next year. The balance of our retail activity for the quarter was a series of some small leases with positive mark-to-markets of 15.8% GAAP and 5% cash. 
I'm now going to turn to our activity in Penn Plaza, where our efforts to reposition our massive holdings continued to pick up momentum this quarter. In our last call, we told you that we were optimistic that after our temporary experiment last year, we would receive approval to close a portion of 33rd Street between 1 Penn and 2 Penn Plaza year-round. In March, the committee voted unanimously to approve the closure, and the city has now given us the green light to close the street indefinitely starting this summer. This is an important opportunity to approve -- to improve the public realm in this area. 
In addition to improving the public realm, we will invest in our holdings to uprade them for today's tenants. In Steve Sandoval Chairman's letter, he included a link to renderings about the PR Caicos design for [indiscernible] Cuban called the skirt. Our intent here is to transform a good 48-year-old building with its punched windows into a modern-age building with new floor-to-ceiling glass curtain wall. The main event here is the massive undulating canopy. In spots, it will be 85 feet high and extend out 65 feet, which has been inspired by the iconic photograph of Maryland Montrose standing over a subway grate. This feature will provide grand entrances for Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and our Two Penn Plaza office building. We believe that this design will become world-famous and in fact, a symbol of New York. 
Our transformation of the area is in the early stages, but you can already see the potential. Our starting rents in One Penn Plaza for the quarter for 9 leases a mix of renewals and new leases, covering 51,000 square feet was over $71 per square foot. Good, but still well below what we believe the building can achieve given its unmatched access to transportation and its location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. 
[indiscernible] announced publicly that its location on the north side of the long island Don Carson Penn Station is its best-performing store in the country on sales per square foot basis. We own that retail on the north side, where we also just signed a lease with Shake Shack and Magnolia Bakery recently opened. 
Finally, as Steve mentioned, April 22 was the due date for the state's request for submissions for both the transformation of the following building and Penn Station itself. That morning, Vornado submitted comprehensive proposals for both, and we believe we can play an important role in the transformation of this area into the gateway that New York deserves, a new empire state station complex. We welcome Governor Cuomo's focus on this area and know that with his involvement, great things are possible. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago where our redevelopment of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors is well underway, with an anticipated completion this June. This transformation includes a grand stair connecting tenants and visitors from the ground floor entry of the building off River Drive up to a new food and beverage experience overlooking the Chicago River, along with our new urban food all on the second floor, which is within steps of the most active transit line in the city of Chicago, which directly empties tenants and visitors into the Mart. Continuing the trend of major corporations moving their headquarters into downtown Chicago from the suburbs, Beam Century, the Spears Company, completed a 113,000 square-foot sublease from Motorola Mobility, adding another great brand-name to our tenant roster. While we did not execute any significant direct leases in the first quarter, taking account of our very active 750,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2015, the Mart seems to numbers for the first quarter were a positive 11.3% GAAP and 25.1% cash. 
A word about the hotel business in New York. While both domestic and international tourism remains strong, the hotel industry is in a down cycle, the victim of gross oversupply. The results of our Hotel Pennsylvania have been weak. We continue to look at this hotel as a parking lot for future development as part of our overall Penn Plaza strategy. As I look at our entire business, excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 6% GAAP. As we noted on our year-end call, we anticipated that same-store growth in our New York business would be back to our historic and consistently strong levels as, in fact, reflected in this quarter's number. While their cars same-store for the first quarter as expected was only a positive 1.7%, as the year continues and free rent periods burn off, we expect to realize cash same-store growth approaching double-digit numbers in the second half of this year, and we will continue to see that strong cash same-store growth continue into 2017 as the massive amount of leasing we completed during 2014 and 2015 and both our office portfolio and our street retail business cycles into our cash NOI. 
To conclude my remarks, the entire New York business had a very strong quarter. Strong same-store increase, strong leasing volume, strong average starting rent, strong and new creditworthy tenants and strong occupancy levels. Our 1.2 million square-foot pipeline of leasing activity is robust with 475,000 square feet of leases in documentation and an additional 750,000 square feet of proposals we are negotiating. We are very constructive on the New York marketplace. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."

In 2015, Washington added 68,000 jobs and the projection is about the same for this year. We seem to be on track thus far with 25,000 jobs added in the first quarter. The region's economy has diversified with job growth focused in professional services, IT, associations and advocacy groups, security tech and cyber and biotech. We should see this job growth translate into more robust office demand as the market continues to recover. The above average job growth is pushing the unemployment rate down to extremely low levels, now at 4.1% for the region. We believe that Washington, our nation's capital, is a forever market that will continue to strengthen. In the first quarter of 2016, we completed 579,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 43 transactions. Office leases signed in the first quarter were flattish, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 3.9% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 2.5%. Our first quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 7.8% of initial rents or $3.01 per square foot per annum, down from Q4, which was 11.5% or $5.06 per square foot per annum. Our overall occupancy was flat at 84.8%. Our office-only occupancy, excluding Skyline, increased by 60 basis points to 90.6%. Skyline declined to 47.4%. Our residential occupancy increased by 70 basis points to 96.8%. 
In downtown Washington D.C. where we own approximately 3.2 million square feet of office space in 11 buildings that are now 96.8% leased, there are several highlights. At the Warner Building where we own 55% in a joint venture, we are finalizing our refinancing. We have largely released the 600,000 square-foot landmark currently to 88% to a great roster of high-quality tenants that include Bigger Bus, General Electric, Facebook, Hewlett Packard, IPO worldwide, Cody, EMV Serrano and the One Campaign. Last week, treasury's office of Inspector General moved into our Boeing Building at 875 15 Street occupying 58,400 square feet. Here we have a prestigious agency who required the quality building close to the main treasury building 2 blocks away. The move coincided precisely with the expiration of the previous tenant. 
At the corner of 17th and M [ph] streets, we are emptying tenants at the contiguous 1726 M Street and 1157 [ph] buildings to make way for our new 335,000 square-foot trophy office building 1700M Streets. Our plan is to begin demolition of these outdated buildings within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent competitive position to go vertical when the time is right. 
Across the Potomac, we are also continuing to make progress in Crystal City. We are actively replacing Brett tenants with a wide array of associations and advocacy groups, professional services and creative companies. Our efforts to revitalize and energize the neighborhood are at full speed and taking shape. A full-page New York Times story that ran on Wednesday April 20, gave a good sense of the creative, authentic community that's growing in Crystal City. WeWork recently opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Park Street in Crystal City. Here we transformed an obsolete office building into a WeWork community that combines, for the first time, their exciting new residential concepts with their proven co-working office space. Office space on the top 2 floors of the building and is now 85% occupied after only 3 months. The balance of the building includes we live 216 new collaborative living community-style apartments that officially opened yesterday to great response and press. This morning, a Washington Post story described the new we live as a fresh take on what apartment life should be like. We Live is bringing a whole new clout to Crystal City, and we are delighted to partner with them. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we have begun preleasing our new 699-unit apartment project to Bartlett. We're seeing strong activity resulting in 125 units already leased at better-than-budgeted rents. We look forward to the first tenant move in June. Located directly atop on new Whole Foods, this 23-story building has great views of DC and the best residential amenity package in town. 
In addition to finishing and opening We Live and the Bartlett, we're putting the final touches on our design for 1770 Crystal Drive. 1770 Crystal Drive is a 270,000 square-foot building in the bulls-eye location that we recaptured when we extended the U.S. marshals and moved them down the street to another building of ours. Located right at the Metro, the existing building will go out of service next year as we fully redevelop it with a new skin, new lobby, new systems and a top floor conference center for delivery in 2018. It will be our first good as new office product of Crystal City in a long time. We're excited about it and expecting great things from it. we will surround it with restaurants and entertainment adding to The Street vitality and heightening the urban experience of Crystal City. 
And finally, we have a tremendous 8 million plus square-foot development pipeline on land that we own outright for significant value creation. Included in that number is our 7.5-acre parcel in Rockland, which we own in a joint venture arguably the best beachfront location in all of the Washington region. In March, we received long thought entitlement approval to build 2.5 million square feet of new office residential hotel and retail. Clearly, a big step forward in realizing the value from this irreplaceable site. I'd like to thank you very much, and I will turn the call over to the operator for our Q&A."

Capital continues to be very interested in New York and the pricing for assets like that reflects that. For the value-added assets, I have not been many examples yet although I think the wash tower trade is an example is not close it but it's under contract and I think that pricing is very full not ready reflecting the capital markets impacts. So I think pricing for office retail we feel generally continues to be strong even when there's value-added components."

So I think in terms of the highest quality, if anything, the demand looks like it's increasing. In terms of lower quality, we don't focus there is I'm not that concerned about it, but I can tell you that a lot of that is debt-driven stuff with entrepreneurial sponsors and buyers and sellers. And the debt markets that drive that kind of speculation is getting very skittish. So the availability of wild and that the finance that kind of stuff is a little bit or maybe even a lot so that is obviously affecting that activity level.

I had a fairly long page in my annual shareholders letter this year, which was titled I think public real estate is cheap. I think that was the title of that section, if I remember. And it was basically a discussion about NAV versus share prices for our company and the other New York folks are colleagues in New York. So what we do is we basically are an NAV-focused management. We believe that NAV is the road map of value and that it's the most accurate predictor of what the value of the companies are. NAV is based upon the private market values and a cap rate. And so we do our work, and you do yours and the folks on the phone do theirs. So that NAV is the road map, and we have been very clear in stating that in New York have been equally as clear in saying that we think that the NAV's are substantially above the stock prices. The punchline to my opening remarks today about the $200 million of cash NOI that is in the bag from signed leases that will flow into our financials over the next short period of time is that that creates $20 or $25 a share of NAV. Now Empire is a friend of mine, but Vornado's Vornado and so $25 a share is $5 billion of incremental increased value. Now a lot of the analysts who do this kind of math have some forward number, which is more than the number of $900 million that I mentioned today. But clearly, the vast majority of that $20 to $25 a share is not yet in anybody's numbers. So the long in the short of it is that we are NAV oriented we do our NAV as you do yours and we think the lessons are that the stock sales are much less than the NAV. So our case very substantially less. Now as I've said before, and I think I said this in the letter, I, lifelong public company executive, so I may -- I worship the God of the stock market and the stock market says the stock market is a waiting machine and that's my answer."

Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco; the 3.7 million square foot MART in Chicago; all of our office, res",1478,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco; the 3.7 million square foot MART in Chicago; all of our office, residential and development properties in Washington; a couple of billion dollars of cash and much more. But the main event here at Vornado is our New York office and our dominant New York street retail business. And that business having -- has industry-leading asset quality, is performing at very high levels and is growing like crazy. 
The road here is organic, the most profitable kind coming from our existing assets where taxes and operating expenses are already baked in, so that substantially all of each dollar of incremental revenue falls right to the bottom line. And this growth requires us to spend only TIs and leasing commissions of, say, $100 per square foot which is a small fraction of the capital required to buy or build in New York, which might cost $1,000 or $1,500 or even $2,000 per square foot. And none of this growth is yet transparent to the market. 
So here's the math. Over the past 2 years, we did 7.1 million square feet at share of leasing in New York, at theMART and at 555 California Street, which is 2.3 million square feet higher than our 2-year average. As of today, from this leasing, we had $200 million plus of incremental additive cash NOI on deck, not yet in our numbers, which will be recognized between now and 2018 as follows: $41 million in the remainder of this year $120 million in 2017 and another $39 million in 2018, all from signed leases which have not yet commenced paying cash rent. The breakdown is $123 million from New York office, $57 million from New York street retail and $20 million from theMART and 555 California Street. These are not projections. All of this is from signed leases from tenants such as PwC at 90 Park Avenue, Neuberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Facebook and AOL Verizon at 770 Broadway, Amazon at 7 West 34th Street, Macy's at 11 Penn, Foot Locker and Structure Tone at 330 West 34th Street, Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue, Swatch Harry Winston at St. Regis, ConAgra at theMART and many, many others. 
The equivalent GAAP increment that has yet to come into income over that period is $83 million. As you know, GAAP rent recognition commences earlier than cash rent recognition due to free rent periods. Importantly, because NAV the principal measure of value is calculated based on cash NOI, this additional $200 million increment will increase our NAV by a very meaningful $20 to $25 per share, depending upon the cap rate one uses. For those of who are in the modeling business, our internal budget showed 2017 cash NOI from our New York Office and street retail, plus theMART and 555 California is about $1.1 billion, give or take. As a point of reference, 2015 was $900 million. That's $1.1 billion in 2017 versus $900 million already booked in the year 2015. You should note that we will, of course, have leases that will expire during these periods, and all the leasing activity which could positively or negatively affect both NOI and EBITDA. 
Now to the quarter. Our comparable FFO was $1.08 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.07 for last year's first quarter. Our New York business produced $14.9 million of comparable EBITDA growth or $0.08 per share even after being penalized by $5.1 million noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable from early lease terminations we initiated to make way for replacement leases at 20-plus mark-to-markets. Excluding that straight-line write-off, growth was $20 million or $0.10 per share. The New York business produced a 5.5% same-store increase. 
Focusing on the entire company, the way we look at it, the Washington business declined by an expected $5 million, of which negative $2.1 million is from increasing vacancy at Skyline and properties taken out of service; and negative $2.9 million is from the core, all on track with our guidance. The fair value earnings of our real estate fund declined by $5.2 million quarter-over-quarter. As you know, the fund is in harvest phase and continues to shrink all unplanned. And we are carrying $1.9 billion of cash, $900 million more than the prior year's quarter, and that has a quarterly opportunity of cost, of say $0.05 per share. Adjusting for these items, our pro forma comparable FFO per share would have been $0.10 higher, a 9.3% increase from the prior year's quarter. 
Now to other businesses. On April 22, a little over a week ago, we submitted 2 comprehensive proposals in response to the state's RFP and RFEI, one for the Farley building in partnership with the related companies at Skanska and a second on our own for Penn Station. We welcomed Governor Cuomo's spotlight on Penn Station and the Penn Plaza District. We were the early mover in Penn Plaza. We have accumulated 9 million square feet here in the very heart of Manhattan's new West Side. And as I have said repeatedly, Penn Plaza is Vornado's Big Kahuna. 
At 220 Central Park South, our for sale condo project, traffic has picked up in the sales room benefiting from the rising building now being very clearly visible from Central Park and the calming of the financial -- the global financial markets. We continue to explore separating the Washington business and we have begun a process to disclose of the Skyline profit -- properties, which are subject to $678 million mortgage loan. At our request, loan has been transferred to the special services. Consequently, based on our shortening estimated holding -- shortened estimated holding period, we recognized the $160.7 million noncash impairment loss in this quarter. 
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the first quarter we leased 1,403,000 square feet in 106 separate transactions. In New York, we leased 737,000 square feet of office space at starting rents of $84.32 and positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. Business in New York is really good. 
And asset pricing in New York continues to set records. Here are 2 examples hot off the press. First, the 50 front foot Valentino flagship on Upper Fifth Avenue mid-block between 54th and 55th Street on the East Side has just gone to contract to a European high net worth individual. We hear the price is $525 million, well through the $480 million asking price, which equates to $11.3 million per retail front foot. 
Vornado owns the balance of this block, both sides of the mid-block Valentino property including both corners consisting of the St. Regis Retail's 100 front feet and 689 Fifth Avenue with 50 front feet, which gives us a total of 150 front feet on this super premium block which, I guess, based upon the comp is now worth for sure well over $1.5 billion. 
This sale certainly validates Upper Fifth Avenue values. 2 years ago in my annual message to shareholders pages 14 and 15, if you would like to look it up, I provided a numerical tour of Upper Fifth Avenue values. We own 20% of the retail frontage on Upper Fifth, including stores for Victoria's Secret, Ferragamo, Swatch, Harry Vinson, MAC Cosmetics, Massimo Dutti, UNIQLO, Hollister, et cetera. 
The second recent sale of note, the Sony building 550 Madison Avenue at 56th Street, coincidentally just behind the St. Regis, has also just gotten to contract to a high net worth Middle Eastern family for $1,800 a foot. The seller abandoned plans for a residential conversion. The building will be delivered vacant intended for high-end office use. These 2 noteworthy sales both involving high net worth individuals, not countries, not sovereign wealth funds, not pension plans or the like, further validate the strength of New York, the enormous liquidity in the marketplace and the global appeal of prime New York real estate as a store of value. It's important to note that these 2 assets are very high quality. And by the way, I can't resist to plug our portfolio is filled with assets of equivalent value -- equivalent quality. 
This is proxy season. Our Annual Shareholders Meeting is May 19. This year, we have modernized our governance to conform with the best practices. Special thanks to Candace Beinecke, our Corporate Governance Committee Chair, who has led the charge here and has now taken on the additional responsibility of lead trustee. Thank you to Candace. 
To sum it up, business is really good. We're excited to be putting up growth numbers from our on-deck leases and our highest priorities are to resolve Washington and to dig in and get to work in Penn Plaza. 
Now over to Steve Theriot."

Steve covered our financial results, so I will limit my comments to a couple of items. I want to highlight 2 items that will affect the quarterly comparison of our New York business growth in comparable EBITDA and FFO for the remainder of 2016. First, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized $27 million of noncash nonrecurring income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the leases at the St. Regis Retail property and the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison. 
Second, during the remainder of 2016, we will write-off straight-line rent receivable balances totaling $9.7 million triggered by our early termination of leases with J.Crew and Rocket Fuel, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for that space with mark-to-markets of 20-plus percent GAAP and cash. While the write-off of straight-line rent receivable balances will reduce EBITDA in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective, increasing future EBITDA. 
Together, these 2 non-cash adjustments to recapture and relet space at much higher rents will negatively affect the quarterly comparison of our growth in our New York businesses comparable EBITDA and FFO in the second quarter of 2016 by $11.3 million, the third quarter by $12.5 million and the fourth quarter by $12.9 million. We reaffirm our guidance to comparable EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Now turning to capital markets. In March, we completed a $300 million refinancing of One Park Avenue, a 947,000 square foot Manhattan office building in which we own a 55% interest. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $45 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 4.99% fixed rate $250 million loan. 
In February, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which we'll swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65% fixed rate $353 million loan. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are: $709 million, consisting primarily the $550 million Mart loan which matures in December 2016; our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $697 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue; and $161 million at the Warner Building. We are well along on these refinancings and expect to close the Warner Building refinancing in a couple of days. 
Excluding the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self-liquidate from signed sales contracts, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 77% with a weighted average debt of 3.99% and a weighted average term of 4.8 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.18% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years. 
Debt-to-enterprise value is 31%. Debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 7.5x. Pro forma excluding debt related to Skyline, which has recently transferred to the special servicer and using, say, $1 billion of excess cash to reduce debt, our pro forma consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio strengthens to 6.3x. In addition, including our share of partially owned entities debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our pro forma debt -- total debt-to-EBITDA ratio calculated on the same basis increases to 7.0x from 6.3x. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have, as of today, 4.4 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.5 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294845,971520,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time",1982,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time record highs. 
In the first quarter, the Manhattan leasing market continued to perform well as the city's highly diversified economy continues to create tenant demand across all industries and submarkets. Despite global volatility, the overall leasing market remains resilient with first quarter leasing volume of better than 8 million square feet, which included 10 large block transactions comprised of a balanced mix of financial services, TAMI and professional business services tenancies. 
Asking rents in Midtown continue increase quarter-over-quarter having now eclipsed the $80 per square foot mark. The overall availability rate continues to hover around 10%, importantly, which includes sublet availability which is now down to a nominal 1.5%, representing the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2008. 
New York City's job growth continues to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 with total private sector employment growth of 24,200 jobs including 7,100 office using jobs, both on par with the strong job creation we realized in 2015. And by the way, these are actual reported job growth numbers, not seasonally adjusted. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, ""Companies flock to cities with top talent, and New York continues to be a top magnet for top talent."" I will repeat what I said last quarter, business has been and remains very good. 
Let me now turn to our own office portfolio. During the first quarter, we completed 737,000 square feet of leasing activity and 36 transactions. This quarter's average starting rents reached $84.32 per square foot with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. I might add that even if you exclude one large lease extension we executed this quarter, our starting rents would still be over $79 per square foot and our mark-to-markets would be over 30% GAAP and 28% cash. 
Our quarter ending office occupancy was 96.4%. We remain full. And reflecting on the city's continuing healthy job growth, I would note that of the 737,000 square feet we leased in the first quarter, fully 41% of the activity was comprised of tenants expanding their footprint in New York, in our case, attributable to 2 significant leases I'll talk about in a minute, PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Facebook. 
In anticipation of the scheduled exploration of the space formerly occupied by big pharma companies, Sterling Winthrop and Sanofi at 90 Park Avenue, during 2015, we completed a significant $70 million redevelopment of the building which has been extremely well received by the marketplace. 
As we reposition and transform buildings in our portfolio, time and time again, we successfully have attracted large credit headquarters tenants: Neuberger Berman at 1296 Avenue, Guggenheim in 330 Madison Avenue, Amazon in 7 West 34th Street, PJT Partners and Franklin Templeton Investments at 280 Park Avenue, Foot Locker and Deutsch Advertising in 330 West 34th Street, Facebook and AOL Verizon in 770 Broadway and on and on. 
And this quarter's leasing highlight was our 241,000 square foot headquarters lease with PwC at 90 Park Avenue. PwC is the largest professional services firm in the world. And this new lease is pure expansion for PwC, creating a campus-like environment for its New York workforce in close proximity to its present office at 300 Madison Avenue. This was a competitive deal, and we are delighted that PwC selected 90 Park Avenue as its second headquarters location in New York. 
The transformation at 90 Park Avenue has totally modernized the infrastructure of this asset as well as dramatically reimagining the aesthetic of the building to attract both the millennial generation. I'll note here that 80% of PwC's New York workforce are millennials as well as the more traditional financial services tenants. In this 950,000 square foot Class A property, in the past year, we have leased 540,000 square feet and have an additional lease out for signature of another 120,000 square feet, bringing the building to 93% occupancy, all at robust mark-to-markets of 25% GAAP and 20% cash. We have now secured 3 major tenants in the building: PwC, FactSet at the national law firm Foley & Lardner, along with a concentration of boutique, financial services tenants will occupy the mid-rise and tower of the building including Nuveen, EverBank, Aegon and the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Speaking to the quality of our New York portfolio, in the quarter, we continued to outperform the market as is it relates to deals of $100 per square foot or greater. We executed 6 leases this quarter totaling 340,000 square feet, with starting rents averaging $116 per square foot. Driving these numbers, Level 3 renewed its 60,000 square foot lease at 85 Tenth Avenue. Facebook added another 80,000 square feet at our 770 Broadway where we were able to recapture a below market lease in order to satisfy Facebook's ever-growing need for space. And Bloomberg extended its lease in the tower office floors at 731 Lexington Avenue to 2029 to be coterminous with its 700,000 square foot main lease. 
In our retail portfolio, during the first quarter, we completed 38,000 square feet of leasing activity in 7 transactions. The highlight of the quarter was our 20,000 square foot lease with Starbucks for its new Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room concept, which will be Starbucks' largest outlet in the world, modeled on the concept store that debuted in the company's hometown of Seattle 2 years ago. Even we were surprised by the worldwide business press this lease received. 
Looking for the perfect location to open the second outpost of its high-end brand, Starbucks, after an extensive process, selected our development site at 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street because of its close proximity to the Chelsea Market, Google's offices, the Apple Store and the High Line. We broke ground on the 61 Ninth development just a few weeks ago and we will be delivering the iconic 170,000 square foot building designed by Rafael Viñoly by the end of next year. The balance of our retail activity for the quarter was a series of some small leases with positive mark-to-markets of 15.8% GAAP and 5% cash. 
I'm now going to turn to our activity in Penn Plaza, where our efforts to reposition our massive holdings continue to pick up momentum this quarter. In our last call, we told you that we were optimistic that after our temporary experiment last year, we would receive approval to close a portion of 33rd Street between One Penn and Two Penn Plaza year-round. In March, the community board voted unanimously to approve the closure and the city has now given us the green light to close the street indefinitely starting this summer. This is an important opportunity to approve -- to improve the public realm in this area. 
In addition to improving the public realm, we will invest in our holdings to upgrade them for today's tenants. In Steve's annual chairman's letter, he included a link to renderings of a Bjarke Ingels design for Two Penn called, the skirt. Our intent here is to transform a good 48-year-old building with its punched windows into a modern-age building with new floor-to-ceiling glass curtain wall. The main event here is the massive undulating canopy. In spots, it will be 85 feet high and extend out 65 feet, which has been inspired by the iconic photograph of Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate. This feature will provide grand entrances for Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and our Two Penn Plaza office building. We believe that this design will become world-famous and in fact, a symbol of New York. 
Our transformation of the area is in the early stages, but you can already see the potential. Our starting rents in One Penn Plaza for the quarter for 9 leases, a mix of renewals and new leases covering 51,000 square feet, was over $71 per square foot. Good, but still well below what we believe the building can achieve given its unmatched access to transportation and its location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. 
Pret A Manger announced publicly that its location on the North side of the Long Island Rail Road Concourse in Penn Station is its best-performing store in the country on sales per square foot basis. We own that retail on the North side, where we also just signed a lease with Shake Shack, and Magnolia Bakery recently opened. 
Finally, as Steve mentioned, April 22 was the due date for the state's request for submissions for both the transformation of the following building and Penn Station itself. That morning, Vornado submitted comprehensive proposals for both, and we believe we can play an important role in the transformation of this area into the gateway that New York deserves, a new Empire State station complex. We welcome Governor Cuomo's focus on this area and know that with his involvement, great things are possible. 
Let me now turn to theMART in Chicago where our redevelopment of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors is well underway, with an anticipated completion this June. This transformation includes a grand stair connecting tenants and visitors from the ground floor entry of the building off River Drive up to a new food and beverage experience overlooking the Chicago River, along with our new urban food hall on the second floor, which is within steps of the most active transit line in the City of Chicago, which directly empties tenants and visitors into theMART. 
Continuing the trend of major corporations moving their headquarters into downtown Chicago from the suburbs, Beam Suntory, the spirits company, completed a 113,000 square foot sublease from Motorola Mobility, adding another great brand name to our tenant roster. While we did not execute any significant direct leases in the first quarter, taking account of our very active 750,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2015, theMART same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 11.3% GAAP and 25.1% cash. 
A word about the hotel business in New York. While both domestic and international tourism remains strong, the hotel industry is in a down cycle, the victim of gross oversupply. The results of our Hotel Pennsylvania had been weak. We continue to look at this hotel as a parking lot for future development as part of our overall Penn Plaza strategy. As I look at our entire business, excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 6% GAAP. As we noted on our year-end call, we anticipated that same-store growth in our New York business would be back to our historic and consistently strong levels as, in fact, reflected in this quarter's number. While their cars same-store for the first quarter as expected was only a positive 1.7%. As the year continues and free rent periods burn off, we expect to realize cash same-store growth approaching double-digit numbers in the second half of this year and we will continue to see that strong cash same-store growth continue into 2017 as the massive amount of leasing we completed during 2014 and 2015 in both our office portfolio and our street retail business cycles into our cash NOI. 
To conclude my remarks, the entire New York business had a very strong quarter, strong same-store increase, strong leasing volume, strong average starting rent, strong and new creditworthy tenants and strong occupancy levels. Our 1.2 million square foot pipeline of leasing activity is robust with 475,000 square feet of leases in documentation and an additional 750,000 square feet of proposals we are negotiating. We are very constructive on the New York marketplace. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."

In 2015, Washington added 68,000 jobs and the projection is about the same for this year. We seem to be on track thus far with 25,000 jobs added in the first quarter. The region's economy has diversified with job growth focused in professional services, IT, associations and advocacy groups, security tech and cyber and biotech. We should see this job growth translate into more robust office demand as the market continues to recover. The above average job growth is pushing the unemployment rate down to extremely low levels now at 4.1% for the region. We believe that Washington, our nation's capital, is a forever market that will continue to strengthen. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we completed 579,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 43 transactions. Office leases signed in the first quarter were flattish, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 3.9% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 2.5%. Our first quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 7.8% of initial rents or $3.01 per square foot per annum, down from Q4 which was 11.5% or $5.06 per square foot per annum. Our overall occupancy was flat at 84.8%. Our office-only occupancy, excluding Skyline, increased by 60 basis points to 90.6%. Skyline declined to 47.4%. Our residential occupancy increased by 70 basis points to 96.8%. 
In Downtown Washington D.C. where we own approximately 3.2 million square feet of office space in 11 buildings that are now 96.8% leased, there are several highlights. At the Warner Building where we own 55% in a joint venture, we are finalizing our refinancing. We have largely re-leased the 600,000 square foot landmark currently to 88% to a great roster of high-quality tenants that include Baker Botts, General Electric, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, APCO worldwide, Cody, EMD Serono and the One Campaign. Last week, Treasury's Office of Inspector General moved into our Bowen Building at 875 15th Street occupying 58,400 square feet. Here we have a prestigious agency who required the quality building close to the main treasury building 2 blocks away. The move coincided precisely with the expiration of the previous tenant. 
At the corner of 17th and M Streets, we are emptying tenants at the contiguous 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street buildings to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building 1700 M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition of these outdated buildings within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent competitive position to go vertical when the time is right. 
Across the Potomac, we are also continuing to make progress in Crystal City. We are actively replacing BRAC tenants with a wide array of associations and advocacy groups, professional services and creative companies. Our efforts to revitalize and energize the neighborhood are at full speed and taking shape. A full-page New York Times story that ran on Wednesday April 20, gave a good sense of the creative, authentic community that's growing in Crystal City. 
WeWork recently opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street in Crystal City. Here we transformed an obsolete office building into a WeWork community that combines, for the first time, their exciting new residential concept with their proven co-working office space. The office space on the top 2 floors of the building and it's now 85% occupied after only 3 months. The balance of the building includes WeLive, 216 new collaborative living community-style apartments that officially opened yesterday to great response and press. This morning, a Washington Post story described the new WeLive as a fresh take on what apartment life should be like. WeLive is bringing a whole new crowd to Crystal City, and we are delighted to partner with them. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we have begun pre-leasing our new 699-unit apartment project, the Bartlett. We're seeing strong activity resulting in 125 units already leased at better-than-budgeted rents. We look forward to the first tenant move ins in June. Located directly atop of new Whole Foods, this 23-story building has great views of D.C. and the best residential amenity package in town. 
In addition to finishing and opening WeLive and The Bartlett, we're putting the final touches on our design for 1770 Crystal Drive. 1770 Crystal Drive is a 270,000 square foot building in the bulls-eye location that we recaptured when we extended the U.S. Marshals and moved them down the street to another building of ours. Located right at the Metro, the existing building will go out of service next year as we fully redevelop it with a new skin, new lobby, new systems and a top floor conference center for delivery in 2018. It will be our first good-as-new office product of Crystal City in a long time. We're excited about it and expecting great things from it. We will surround it with restaurants and entertainment adding to the street vitality and heightening the urban experience of Crystal City.
And finally, we have a tremendous 8 million-plus square foot development pipeline on land that we own outright for significant value creation. Included in that number is our 7.5-acre parcel in Rosslyn, which we own in a joint venture, arguably the best beachfront location in all of the Washington region. In March, we received long-sought entitlement approval to build 2.5 million square feet of new office, residential, hotel and retail, clearly, a big step forward in realizing the value from this irreplaceable site. 
I'd like to thank you very much, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for our Q&A."

I think the math is basically -- and we've actually done some work here with econometric types, that provided the job growth stays relatively positive, and when I say relatively positive, the job growth has been somewhere in the kind of 2.5% to 3% growth range for office sector jobs, if that number moderates to the 1.5% to 2% range, I think we're going to be just fine as it relates to the absorption of the -- that space.

The -- I care more about the Hudson Yards competition, which is in the mid-80s and of dollars a foot, and that competes with the general marketplace. And so I think that's finite. That will be gone, and then everything will be fine. So I relish competition that comes on at $150 a foot because that gives us a tremendous opportunity to compete at much lower prices and be extremely successful, and so that's my comment. The other thing is that each building competes in a -- for its tenants in a different geography and each building has a different culture. So there you have it. Obviously, we will get through this. We will absorb it. We will thrive. And a lot of it has to do with what the world looks like as these buildings get a little bit closer."

And I think that pricing was very full, not really reflecting a capital market's impact. So I think pricing for office, retail generally continues to be strong even when there's value-add components."

But I can tell you that a lot of that is debt-driven stuff with entrepreneurial sponsors and buyers and sellers. And the debt markets that drive that kind of speculation is getting very skittish. So the availability of wild and wooly debt to finance that kind of stuff is withdrawing a little bit or maybe even a lot, so that obviously affected that activity level.

I had a fairly long page in my annual shareholders' letter this year, which was titled I think public real estate is cheap. I think that was the title of that section, if I remember. And it was basically a discussion about NAV versus share prices for our company and the other New York folks, our colleagues in New York. So what we do is we basically are an NAV-focused management. We believe that NAV is the road map of value and that it's the most accurate predictor of what the value of the companies are. NAV is based upon what the private market values at a cap rate. And so we do our work and you do yours and all the the folks on the phone do theirs. So we think that the NAV is the road map, and we have been very clear in stating, by the way  a lot of our colleagues in New York have been equally as clear in saying that we think that the NAV's are substantially above the stock prices. Now the punchline to my opening remarks today about the $200 million of cash NOI that is in the bag from signed leases that will flow into our financials over the next short period of time is that, that creates $20 or $25 a share of NAV. Now Empire is a friend of mine, but Vornado's Vornado and so $25 a share is $5 billion of incremental increased value. Now a lot of the analysts who do this kind of math have some forward number, which is more than the number of $900 million that I mentioned today. But clearly, the vast majority of that $20 to $25 a share is not yet in anybody's numbers. So the long and the short of it is that we are NAV-oriented. We do our NAV as you do yours, and we think the lessons are that the stock sells for much less than the NAV. So our case, very substantially less. Now as I've said before and I think I said this in the letter, I'm a lifelong public company executive. So I may -- I worship the God of the stock market, and the stock market says -- the stock market is a weighing machine, and that's my answer."

Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco; the 3.7 million square foot MART in Chicago; all of our office, res",1480,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco; the 3.7 million square foot MART in Chicago; all of our office, residential and development properties in Washington; a couple of billion dollars of cash and much more. But the main event here at Vornado is our New York office and our dominant New York street retail business. And that business having -- has industry-leading asset quality, is performing at very high levels and is growing like crazy. 
The road here is organic, the most profitable kind coming from our existing assets where taxes and operating expenses are already baked in, so that substantially all of each dollar of incremental revenue falls right to the bottom line. And this growth requires us to spend only TIs and leasing commissions of, say, $100 per square foot, which is a small fraction of the capital required to buy or build in New York, which might cost $1,000 or $1,500 or even $2,000 per square foot. And none of this growth is yet transparent to the market. 
So here's the math. Over the past 2 years, we did 7.1 million square feet at share of leasing in New York, at theMART and at 555 California Street, which is 2.3 million square feet higher than our 2-year average. As of today, from this leasing, we have $200 million plus of incremental additive cash NOI on deck, not yet in our numbers, which will be recognized between now and 2018 as follows: $41 million in the remainder of this year; $120 million in 2017; and another $39 million in 2018, all from signed leases, which have not yet commenced paying cash rent. The breakdown is $123 million from New York office, $57 million from New York street retail and $20 million from theMART and 555 California Street. These are not projections. All of this is from signed leases from tenants such as PwC at 90 Park Avenue, Neuberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Facebook and AOL Verizon at 770 Broadway, Amazon at 7 West 34th Street, Macy's at 11 Penn, Foot Locker and Structure Tone at 330 West 34th Street, Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue, Swatch, Harry Winston at St. Regis, ConAgra at theMART and many, many others. 
The equivalent GAAP increment that has yet to come into income over that period is $83 million. As you know, GAAP rent recognition commences earlier than cash rent recognition due to free rent periods. Importantly, because NAV the principal measure of value is calculated based on cash NOI, this additional $200 million increment will increase our NAV by a very meaningful $20 to $25 per share, depending upon the cap rate one uses. For those of you who are in the modeling business, our internal budget showed 2017 cash NOI from our New York Office and street retail, plus theMART and 555 California is about $1.1 billion, give or take. As a point of reference, 2015 was $900 million. That's $1.1 billion in 2017 versus $900 million already booked in the year 2015. You should note that we will, of course, have leases that will expire during these periods and other leasing activity, which could positively or negatively affect both NOI and EBITDA. 
Now to the quarter. Our comparable FFO was $1.08 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.07 for last year's first quarter. Our New York business produced $14.9 million of comparable EBITDA growth or $0.08 per share even after being penalized by $5.1 million noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable from early lease terminations we initiated to make way for replacement leases at 20-plus mark-to-markets. Excluding that straight-line write-off, growth was $20 million or $0.10 per share. The New York business produced a 5.5% same-store increase. 
Focusing on the entire company, the way we look at it, the Washington business declined by an expected $5 million, of which negative $2.1 million is from increasing vacancy at Skyline and properties taken out of service and negative $2.9 million is from the core, all on track with our guidance. The fair value earnings of our real estate fund declined by $5.2 million quarter-over-quarter. As you know, the fund is in harvest phase and continues to shrink all on plan. And we are carrying $1.9 billion of cash, $900 million more than the prior year's quarter, and that has a quarterly opportunity of cost, of say $0.05 per share. Adjusting for these items, our pro forma comparable FFO per share would have been $0.10 higher, a 9.3% increase from the prior year's quarter. 
Now to other businesses. On April 22, a little over a week ago, we submitted 2 comprehensive proposals in response to the state's RFP and RFEI, one for the Farley building in partnership with the related companies at Skanska and a second on our own for Penn Station. We welcomed Governor Cuomo's spotlight on Penn Station and the Penn Plaza District. We were the early mover in Penn Plaza. We have accumulated 9 million square feet here in the very heart of Manhattan's new West Side. And as I have said repeatedly, Penn Plaza is Vornado's Big Kahuna. 
At 220 Central Park South, our for sale condo project, traffic has picked up in the sales room benefiting from the rising building now being very clearly visible from Central Park and the calming of the financial -- the global financial markets. 
We continue to explore separating the Washington business and we have begun a process to disclose of the Skyline profit -- properties, which are subject to a $678 million mortgage loan. At our request, the loan has been transferred to the special service line. Consequently, based on our shortening estimated holding -- shortened estimated holding period, we recognized a $160.7 million noncash impairment loss in this quarter. 
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the first quarter we leased 1,403,000 square feet in 106 separate transactions. In New York, we leased 737,000 square feet of office space at starting rents of $84.32 and positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. Business in New York is really good. 
And asset pricing in New York continues to set records. Here are 2 examples hot off the press. First, the 50 front foot Valentino flagship on Upper Fifth Avenue mid-block between 54th and 55th Street on the East Side has just gone to contract to a European high net-worth individual. We hear the price is $525 million, well through the $480 million asking price, which equates to $11.3 million per retail front foot. 
Vornado owns the balance of this block, both sides of the mid-block Valentino property including both corners consisting of the St. Regis Retail's 100 front feet and 689 Fifth Avenue with 50 front feet, which gives us a total of 150 front feet on this super premium block which, I guess, based upon the comp is now worth for sure well over $1.5 billion. 
This sale certainly validates Upper Fifth Avenue values. Two years ago in my annual letter to shareholders pages 14 and 15, if you would like to look it up, I provided a numerical tour of Upper Fifth Avenue values. We own 20% of the retail frontage on Upper Fifth, including stores for Victoria's Secret, Ferragamo, Swatch, Harry Winston, MAC Cosmetics, Massimo Dutti, UNIQLO, Hollister, et cetera. 
The second recent sale of note, the Sony building 550 Madison Avenue at 56th Street, coincidentally just behind the St. Regis, has also just gone to contract to a high net worth Middle Eastern family for $1,800 a foot. The seller abandoned plans for a residential conversion. The building will be delivered vacant, intended for high-end office use. These 2 noteworthy sales, both involving high net worth individuals, not countries, not sovereign wealth funds, not pension plans or the like, further validate the strength of New York, the enormous liquidity in the marketplace and the global appeal of prime New York real estate as a store of value. It's important to note that these 2 assets are very high quality. And by the way, I can't resist to plug, our portfolio is filled with assets of equivalent value -- equivalent quality. 
This is proxy season. Our Annual Shareholders Meeting is May 19. This year, we have modernized our governance to conform to best practices. Special thanks to Candace Beinecke, our Corporate Governance Committee Chair, who has led the charge here and has now taken on the additional responsibility of lead trustee. Thank you to Candace. 
To sum it up, business is really good. We're excited to be putting up growth numbers from our on-deck leases and our highest priorities are to resolve Washington and to dig in and get to work in Penn Plaza. 
Now over to Steve Theriot."

Steve covered our financial results, so I will limit my comments to a couple of items. I want to highlight 2 items that will affect the quarterly comparison of our New York business growth in comparable EBITDA and FFO for the remainder of 2016. First, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized $27 million of noncash nonrecurring income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the leases at the St. Regis Retail property and the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison. 
Second, during the remainder of 2016, we will write-off straight-line rent receivable balances totaling $9.7 million triggered by our early termination of leases with J.Crew and Rocket Fuel, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for that space with mark-to-markets of 20-plus percent GAAP and cash. While the write-off of straight-line rent receivable balances will reduce EBITDA in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective, increasing future EBITDA. 
Together, these 2 non-cash adjustments to recapture and relet space at much higher rents will negatively affect the quarterly comparison of our growth in our New York businesses’ comparable EBITDA and FFO in the second quarter of 2016 by $11.3 million, the third quarter by $12.5 million and the fourth quarter by $12.9 million. We reaffirm our guidance to comparable EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Now turning to capital markets. In March, we completed a $300 million refinancing of One Park Avenue, a 947,000 square foot Manhattan office building in which we own a 55% interest. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $45 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 4.99% fixed rate $250 million loan. 
In February, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The 5-year loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which we'll swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65% fixed rate $353 million loan. 
Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are: $709 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million Mart loan, which matures in December 2016; our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $697 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue and $161 million at the Warner Building. We are well along on these refinancings and expect to close the Warner Building refinancing in a couple of days. 
Excluding the financing of our 220 Central Park South project, which will self-liquidate from signed sales contracts, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 77% with a weighted average debt of 3.99% and a weighted average term of 4.8 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.18% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years. 
Debt-to-enterprise value is 31%. Debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 7.5x. Pro forma excluding debt related to Skyline, which has recently transferred to the special servicer and using, say, $1 billion of excess cash to reduce debt, our pro forma consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio strengthens to 6.3x. In addition, including our share of partially owned entities debt, excluding Toys ""R"" Us, our pro forma debt -- total debt-to-EBITDA ratio calculated on the same basis increases to 7.0x from 6.3x. 
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have, as of today, 4.4 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.5 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business."
312648,318294845,971705,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time",1981,"Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. On our year-end call just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all-time record highs. 
In the first quarter, the Manhattan leasing market continued to perform well as the city's highly diversified economy continues to create tenant demand across all industries and submarkets. Despite global volatility, the overall leasing market remains resilient with first quarter leasing volume of better than 8 million square feet, which included 10 large block transactions comprised of a balanced mix of financial services, TAMI and professional business services tenancies. 
Asking rents in Midtown continue to increase quarter-over-quarter having now eclipsed the $80 per square foot mark. The overall availability rate continues to hover around 10%, importantly, which includes sublet availability, which is now down to a nominal 1.5%, representing the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2008. 
New York City's job growth continues to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 with total private sector employment growth of 24,200 jobs including 7,100 office using jobs, both on par with the strong job creation we realized in 2015. And by the way, these are actual reported job growth numbers, not seasonally adjusted. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, ""Companies flock to cities with top talent, and New York continues to be a top magnet for top talent."" I will repeat what I said last quarter, business has been and remains very good. 
Let me now turn to our own office portfolio. During the first quarter, we completed 737,000 square feet of leasing activity in 36 transactions. This quarter's average starting rents reached $84.32 per square foot with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. I might add that even if you exclude one large lease extension we executed this quarter, our starting rents would still be over $79 per square foot and our mark-to-markets would be over 30% GAAP and 28% cash. 
Our quarter ending office occupancy was 96.4%. We remain full. And reflecting on the city's continuing healthy job growth, I would note that of the 737,000 square feet we leased in the first quarter, fully 41% of the activity was comprised of tenants expanding their footprint in New York, in our case, attributable to 2 significant leases I'll talk about in a minute, PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Facebook. 
In anticipation of the scheduled exploration of the space formerly occupied by big pharma companies, Sterling Winthrop and Sanofi at 90 Park Avenue, during 2015, we completed a significant $70 million redevelopment of the building, which has been extremely well received by the marketplace. 
As we reposition and transform buildings in our portfolio, time and time again, we successfully have attracted large credit headquarters tenants: Neuberger Berman at 1290 Sixth Avenue, Guggenheim in 330 Madison Avenue, Amazon in 7 West 34th Street, PJT Partners and Franklin Templeton Investments at 280 Park Avenue, Foot Locker and Deutsch Advertising in 330 West 34th Street, Facebook and AOL Verizon in 770 Broadway and on and on. 
And this quarter's leasing highlight was our 241,000 square foot headquarters lease with PwC at 90 Park Avenue. PwC is the largest professional services firm in the world. And this new lease is pure expansion for PwC, creating a campus-like environment for its New York workforce in close proximity to its present office at 300 Madison Avenue. This was a competitive deal, and we are delighted that PwC selected 90 Park Avenue as its second headquarters location in New York. 
The transformation at 90 Park Avenue has totally modernized the infrastructure of this asset as well as dramatically reimagining the aesthetic of the building to attract both the millennial generation -- I'll note here that 80% of PwC's New York workforce are millennials, as well as the more traditional financial services tenants. In this 950,000 square foot Class A property, in the past year, we have leased 540,000 square feet and have an additional lease out for signature of another 120,000 square feet, bringing the building to 93% occupancy, all at robust mark-to-markets of 25% GAAP and 20% cash. We have now secured 3 major tenants in the building: PwC, FactSet and national law firm Foley & Lardner, along with a concentration of boutique, financial services tenants will occupy the mid-rise and tower of the building including Nuveen, EverBank, Aegon and the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Speaking to the quality of our New York portfolio, in the quarter, we continued to outperform the market as is it relates to deals of $100 per square foot or greater. We executed 6 leases this quarter totaling 340,000 square feet, with starting rents averaging $116 per square foot. Driving these numbers, Level 3 renewed its 60,000 square foot lease at 85 Tenth Avenue. Facebook added another 80,000 square feet at our 770 Broadway where we were able to recapture a below market lease in order to satisfy Facebook's ever-growing need for space. And Bloomberg extended its lease in the tower office floors at 731 Lexington Avenue to 2029 to be coterminous with its 700,000 square foot main lease. 
In our retail portfolio, during the first quarter, we completed 38,000 square feet of leasing activity in 7 transactions. The highlight of the quarter was our 20,000 square foot lease with Starbucks for its new Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room concept, which will be Starbucks' largest outlet in the world, modeled on the concept store that debuted in the company's hometown of Seattle 2 years ago. Even we were surprised by the worldwide business press this lease received. 
Looking for the perfect location to open the second outpost of its high-end brand, Starbucks, after an extensive process, selected our development site at 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street because of its close proximity to the Chelsea Market, Google's offices, the Apple Store and the High Line. We broke ground on the 61 Ninth development just a few weeks ago and we will be delivering the iconic 170,000 square foot building designed by Rafael Viñoly by the end of next year. The balance of our retail activity for the quarter was a series of small leases with positive mark-to-markets of 15.8% GAAP and 5% cash. 
I'm now going to turn to our activity in Penn Plaza, where our efforts to reposition our massive holdings continued to pick up momentum this quarter. In our last call, we told you that we were optimistic that after our temporary experiment last year, we would receive approval to close a portion of 33rd Street between One Penn and Two Penn Plaza year-round. In March, the community board voted unanimously to approve the closure and the city has now given us the green light to close the street indefinitely starting this summer. This is an important opportunity to approve -- to improve the public realm in this area. 
In addition to improving the public realm, we will invest in our holdings to upgrade them for today's tenants. In Steve's annual chairman's letter, he included a link to renderings of a Bjarke Ingels design for Two Penn called, the skirt. Our intent here is to transform a good 48-year-old building with its punched windows into a modern-age building with new floor-to-ceiling glass curtain wall. The main event here is the massive undulating canopy. In spots, it will be 85 feet high and extend out 65 feet, which has been inspired by the iconic photograph of Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate. This feature will provide grand entrances for Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and our Two Penn Plaza office building. We believe that this design will become world-famous and in fact, a symbol of New York. 
Our transformation of the area is in the early stages, but you can already see the potential. Our starting rents in One Penn Plaza for the quarter for 9 leases, a mix of renewals and new leases covering 51,000 square feet, was over $71 per square foot. Good, but still well below what we believe the building can achieve given its unmatched access to transportation and its location in the center of Manhattan's new West Side. 
Pret A Manger announced publicly that its location on the north side of the Long Island Rail Road Concourse in Penn Station is its best-performing store in the country on a sales-per-square-foot basis. We own that retail on the north side, where we also just signed a lease with Shake Shack, and Magnolia Bakery recently opened. 
Finally, as Steve mentioned, April 22 was the due date for the state's request for submissions for both the transformation of the Farley building and Penn Station itself. That morning, Vornado submitted comprehensive proposals for both, and we believe we can play an important role in the transformation of this area into the gateway that New York deserves, a new Empire State station complex. We welcome Governor Cuomo's focus on this area and know that with his involvement, great things are possible. 
Let me now turn to theMART in Chicago where our redevelopment of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors is well underway, with an anticipated completion this June. This transformation includes a grand stair connecting tenants and visitors from the ground floor entry of the building off River Drive up to a new food and beverage experience overlooking the Chicago River, along with our new urban food hall on the second floor, which is within steps of the most active transit line in the City of Chicago, which directly empties tenants and visitors into theMART. 
Continuing the trend of major corporations moving their headquarters into downtown Chicago from the suburbs, Beam Suntory, the spirits company, completed a 113,000 square foot sublease from Motorola Mobility, adding another great brand name to our tenant roster. While we did not execute any significant direct leases in the first quarter, taking account of our very active 750,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2015, theMART same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 11.3% GAAP and 25.1% cash. 
A word about the hotel business in New York. While both domestic and international tourism remain strong, the hotel industry is in a down cycle, the victim of gross oversupply. The results of our Hotel Pennsylvania have been weak. We continue to look at this hotel as a parking lot for future development as part of our overall Penn Plaza strategy. As I look at our entire business, excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 6% GAAP. As we noted on our year-end call, we anticipated that same-store growth in our New York business would be back to our historic and consistently strong levels as, in fact, reflected in this quarter's number. While the cash same-store for the first quarter as expected was only a positive 1.7%, as the year continues and free rent periods burn off, we expect to realize cash same-store growth approaching double-digit numbers in the second half of this year and we will continue to see that strong cash same-store growth continue into 2017 as the massive amount of leasing we completed during 2014 and 2015 in both our office portfolio and our street retail business cycles into our cash NOI. 
To conclude my remarks, the entire New York business had a very strong quarter, strong same-store increase, strong leasing volume, strong average starting rent, strong and new creditworthy tenants and strong occupancy levels. Our 1.2 million square foot pipeline of leasing activity is robust with 475,000 square feet of leases in documentation and an additional 750,000 square feet of proposals we are negotiating. We are very constructive on the New York marketplace. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington."

In 2015, Washington added 68,000 jobs and the projection is about the same for this year. We seem to be on track thus far with 25,000 jobs added in the first quarter. The region's economy has diversified with job growth focused in professional services, IT, associations and advocacy groups, security tech and cyber and biotech. We should see this job growth translate into more robust office demand as the market continues to recover. The above average job growth is pushing the unemployment rate down to extremely low levels now at 4.1% for the region. We believe that Washington, our nation's capital, is a forever market that will continue to strengthen. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we completed 579,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 43 transactions. Office leases signed in the first quarter were flattish, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 3.9% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 2.5%. Our first quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 7.8% of initial rents or $3.01 per square foot per annum, down from Q4, which was 11.5% or $5.06 per square foot per annum. Our overall occupancy was flat at 84.8%. Our office-only occupancy, excluding Skyline, increased by 60 basis points to 90.6%. Skyline declined to 47.4%. Our residential occupancy increased by 70 basis points to 96.8%. 
In Downtown Washington D.C. where we own approximately 3.2 million square feet of office space in 11 buildings that are now 96.8% leased, there are several highlights. At the Warner Building where we own 55% in a joint venture, we are finalizing our refinancing. We have largely re-leased the 600,000 square foot landmark currently to 88% to a great roster of high-quality tenants that include Baker Botts, General Electric, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, APCO worldwide, Cooley, EMD Serono and the ONE Campaign. Last week, Treasury's Office of Inspector General moved into our Bowen Building at 875 15th Street occupying 58,400 square feet. Here we have a prestigious agency who required a quality building close to the main treasury building 2 blocks away. The move coincided precisely with the expiration of the previous tenant. 
At the corner of 17th and M Streets, we are emptying tenants at the contiguous 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street buildings to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building 1700 M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition of these outdated buildings within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent competitive position to go vertical when the time is right. 
Across the Potomac, we are also continuing to make progress in Crystal City. We are actively replacing BRAC tenants with a wide array of associations and advocacy groups, professional services and creative companies. Our efforts to revitalize and energize the neighborhood are at full speed and taking shape. A full-page New York Times story that ran on Wednesday April 20, gave a good sense of the creative, authentic community that's growing in Crystal City. 
WeWork recently opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street in Crystal City. Here we transformed an obsolete office building into a WeWork community that combines, for the first time, their exciting new residential concept with their proven co-working office space. The office space on the top 2 floors of the building and it's now 85% occupied after only 3 months. The balance of the building includes WeLive, 216 new collaborative living community-style apartments that officially opened yesterday to great response and press. This morning, a Washington Post story described the new WeLive as a fresh take on what apartment life should be like. WeLive is bringing a whole new crowd to Crystal City, and we are delighted to partner with them. 
In adjacent Pentagon City, we have begun pre-leasing our new 699-unit apartment project, The Bartlett. We're seeing strong activity resulting in 125 units already leased at better-than-budgeted rents. We look forward to the first tenant move ins in June. Located directly atop a new Whole Foods, this 23-story building has great views of D.C. and the best residential amenity package in town. 
In addition to finishing and opening WeLive and The Bartlett, we're putting the final touches on our design for 1770 Crystal Drive. 1770 Crystal Drive is a 270,000 square foot building in the bulls-eye location that we recaptured when we extended the U.S. Marshals and moved them down the street to another building of ours. Located right at the Metro, the existing building will go out of service next year as we fully redevelop it with a new skin, new lobby, new systems and a top floor conference center for delivery in 2018. It will be our first good-as-new office product in Crystal City in a long time. We're excited about it and expecting great things from it. We will surround it with restaurants and entertainment adding to the street vitality and heightening the urban experience of Crystal City.
And finally, we have a tremendous 8 million-plus square foot development pipeline on land that we own outright for significant value creation. Included in that number is our 7.5-acre parcel in Rosslyn, which we own in a joint venture, arguably the best beachfront location in all of the Washington region. In March, we received long-sought entitlement approval to build 2.5 million square feet of new office, residential, hotel and retail, clearly, a big step forward in realizing the value from this irreplaceable site. 
I'd like to thank you very much, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for our Q&A."

I think the math is basically -- and we've actually done some work here with econometric types, that provided the job growth stays relatively positive, and when I say relatively positive, the job growth has been somewhere in the kind of 2.5% to 3% growth range for office sector jobs, if that number moderates to the 1.5% to 2% range, I think we're going to be just fine as it relates to the absorption of the -- that space.

The -- I care more about the Hudson Yards competition, which is in the mid-80s and -- dollars a foot, and that competes with the general marketplace. And so I think that's finite. That will be gone, and then everything will be fine. So I relish competition that comes on at $150 a foot because that gives us a tremendous opportunity to compete at much lower prices and be extremely successful, and so that's my comment. The other thing is that each building competes in a -- for its tenants in a different geography and each building has a different culture. So there you have it. Obviously, we will get through this.

There was a low in the market over the end of last year and the first couple of months of this year, I guess, in response to general fatigue, too many other projects coming onboard, extreme worldwide global financial volatility and I think the most interesting of which is we're not delivering for 2.5 years. So the project is off to a roaring start. The marketplace accepts it as being the Class A+ project, and so we -- and so that's the status. Now in the recent weeks, we have had a significant uptick in traffic through our sales room, as I said in my prepared remarks, and we are now negotiating 2 very important deals. The pricing of the project will -- we have no expectation that the pricing of the project will diminish more than a smidge. By the way, it could go up from the in-place contracts that have already been signed. In terms of timing, since we basically have our costs out of the project and we have 2.5 years to go to delivery, we are optimistic that we will have either the entire project or almost the entire project totally sold before we deliver."

So the value-added assets, there have not been many examples yet, although I think the Watchtower trade is an example. It's not closed yet, but it's under contract. And I think that pricing was very full, not really reflecting a capital market's impact.

So I think in terms of the highest quality, the -- if anything, the demand looks like it's increasing. In terms of lower quality, we don't focus there so I'm not that concerned about it. But I can tell you that a lot of that is debt-driven stuff with entrepreneurial sponsors and buyers and sellers. And the debt markets that drive that kind of speculation is getting very skittish. So the availability of wild and wooly debt to finance that kind of stuff is withdrawing a little bit or maybe even a lot, so that obviously affected that activity level. So where I am is in New York, and New York is in a class of its own, by the way. In New York, at the highest quality, if anything, I see an increase in demand and no diminution in pricing."

I had a fairly long page in my annual shareholders' letter this year, which was titled I think public real estate is cheap. I think that was the title of that section, if I remember. And it was basically a discussion about NAV versus share prices for our company and the other New York folks, our colleagues in New York. So what we do is we basically are an NAV-focused management. We believe that NAV is the road map of value and that it's the most accurate predictor of what the value of the companies are. NAV is based upon what the private market values at a cap rate. And so we do our work and you do yours and all the folks on the phone do theirs. So we think that the NAV is the road map, and we have been very clear in saying, and by the way a lot of our colleagues in New York have been equally as clear in saying that we think that the NAVs are substantially above the stock prices. Now the punchline to my opening remarks today about the $200 million of cash NOI that is in the bag from signed leases that will flow into our financials over the next short period of time is that, that creates $20 or $25 a share of NAV. Now Empire is a friend of mine, but Vornado's Vornado and so $25 a share is $5 billion of incremental increased value. Now a lot of the analysts who do this kind of math have some forward number, which is more than the number of $900 million that I mentioned today. But clearly, the vast majority of that $20 to $25 a share is not yet in anybody's numbers. So the long and the short of it is that we are NAV-oriented. We do our NAV as you do yours, and we think the lessons are that the stock sells for much less than the NAV. So our case, very substantially less. Now as I've said before and I think I said this in the letter, I'm a lifelong public company executive. So I may -- I worship for the god of the stock market, and the stock market says -- the stock market is a weighing machine, and that's my answer."

Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south,",980,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. 
Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south, our Hotel Pennsylvania included suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for folly and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza District in the very center of the new West Side are the next big thing, actually, really big thing for our company. 
We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development in progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every 4 days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue, which will be the new home of a 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our high land project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and in 606 Broadway construction has begun. 
In Washington, in Pentagon City, the Whole Foods and the 699 unit [indiscernible] have opened, achieving an extraordinary 45% leased up in just the first 2 months, way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City, we work, we live also open achieving 80% occupancy of the 2/3 of the units that are open. 
The success of the [indiscernible] validates our plan to emphasize residential newbuilds on our nearby vacant land inventory and on select sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Over time, we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to the [indiscernible] immediately. 
So in Crystal City, Pentagon City, our business plan is residential heavy and newbuild heavy, while we continue to grow our office income. 
A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter, the financing markets have settled down. We are in a [indiscernible] market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher, however, is the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has gapped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, and speculative development in New York, which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us. 
In the transactions market after a record-breaking year in 2015, volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors: Volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high-quality product, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high-quality office and retail and multifamily product, though bidding pools have somewhat bid. Capital continues to aggressively pursue in New York, which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the West and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue embedded this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York. 
A couple of comps that worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway, a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway, a couple of blocks from our [indiscernible] and plaza holdings, went under contract to a private foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilize yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located in much higher-quality.
As a retail comp, 155 [indiscernible] Street, a retail condo in SOHO occupied by Dolce and Gabbana, recently went under contract to a private investor group for $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. 
Finally, pricing at San Francisco continues to set records, 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square foot new building near [indiscernible] center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square foot. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco, 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark. 
In May we completed a $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million, of which $159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and $43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The [indiscernible] gain was $90 million, we continue to manage and lease the property.
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the second quarter, we leased 1,025,000 square feet and 97 transactions. In new York, we leased 544,000 square feet of office space, including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island city. The average [indiscernible] rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island city was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. 
In Washington, we leased 369,000 square feet with mark-to-markets excluding Skyline, were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash.
Yesterday, we called for redemption on our 6 and 7/8 Series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded out of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activities."

Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share",856,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share as compared to $1.26 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we previewed on last quarter's call, this quarter -- this year's second quarter has some accounting noise, which masked the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me take you through the math. And in our New York business, the quarter's results include $7.9 million of noncash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight-line rent receivables triggered by our early termination of New York office leases, primarily J.Crew and the Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One at 90 Park Avenue, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable reduces our GAAP in earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future for you to earnings. 
Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year second quarter, remember that the prior year's second quarter included $5.4 million of noncash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison, again, to clear out space for higher-paying tenants. 
In addition, as David will explain shortly, the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by $5.1 million. The punchline is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison growth of our New York core earnings by $18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items, New York's earnings grew by $28.2 million or 11.1%. 
We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me comment on our fad ratio, which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's works to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last 2 years, is occurring ahead of the commencement of the $216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8-K dated June 7, 2016. 
Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter, in addition to the $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned, we completed a $273 million refinancing of the Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington D.C. office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as the fixed-rate of 3.65% is interest-only for the first 2 years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 3. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%, $293 million mortgage. 
Also in the quarter, at 280 Park Avenue, the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture, we completed a $900 million refinancing. The 3-year loan with 4, 1-year options is interest-only at LIBOR plus 2% -- 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $725 million mortgage.
We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's crossroads, Virginia. The loan is recourse only to these Skyline properties. 
In the second quarter, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default, causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental rate of interest. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we accrued at $2.7 million of default interest expense. 
Excluding Skyline, our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $593.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million, 5.57% mark loan, which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. 
Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $75.6 million. 
Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed-rate debt accounted for 73% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and a floating rate debt accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years. Debt-to-enterprise value is 24%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA, is 5.2x. Including our share of partially owned entities, debt other than Toys R Us, debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have $4.3 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum."
312648,318294855,1021324,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you. I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprised Brexit v",1720,"Steve, thank you. I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprised Brexit vote. Despite of the disruptive potential of these 2 events, the stock market has been resilient. While many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets as ""Moving sideways"" the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing of the first 6 months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet, comparable to 10-year averages, although activity was largely driven by renewals. Importantly, sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in 8 years. 
On prior calls, we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of the TAMI sector making the city less reliant on a traditional financial services sector. Interestingly, this year, we have seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the health care sector, which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services. Just recently, NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building, which is less than 15 years old had been occupied by a prominent law firm. 
While not typically considered a large occupier of office space, over the last 5 years, some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined health care and education sectors. And we, at Vornado, have a significant share of those operations. With Colombia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, NYU Langone at One Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue, a total of 700,000 square feet of health care operations. 
Ultimately, the [indiscernible] market is specifically office using jobs. For the first 6 months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high. At 5%, the city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. 
Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to Verizon strike. 2 months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.
Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well-positioned. On the office side, we have 8 trophy buildings that command $100 plus rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West side, including Penn Plaza and Chelsea where tenants increasingly want to be. We have completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last 3 years totaling 6.5 million square feet ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopments in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet.
On the street retail side, our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the [indiscernible] Times Square, Madison Avenue, SOHO and 34th Street. 
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96%. In a
[Audio Gap]
544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activity, some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67, representing mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of [indiscernible] at 90 Park Avenue, which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redevelopments redeveloped asset. The balance of our leasing activity this quarter, some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of 2 leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island city. These leases and starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect a rapidly changing Long Island city landscape, representing mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place, the yield on our investment in this building is now 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the releasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.
For the first 6 months of the year, we closed 6 of Craig's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Austin and Bird at 90 Park Avenue; Facebook and AOL, Verizon at 770 Broadway; Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue; and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. 
I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio. We continue to see that in our ability to make than our fair share of deals of $100 plus per square foot. In the second quarter, we signed 3 such leases, a total of 34,500 square feet at the average starting rents of $143 per foot. Year-to-date, we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet. 
In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity and 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the 4 Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search, the 4 Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue is the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly 6 decades at the [indiscernible] building. The new restaurant, when it opens in late 2017, will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program, a clear sign of our success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue. 
At 692 Broadway, AOL signed a 10,000 square foot lease for a new experiential concept [indiscernible] space for the Huffington live interview series. And in 11 Penn Plaza, MSG Networks renewed some [indiscernible]  of studio space on-the-ground floor lower level. Our largest and best in class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago. In June, we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and second floors. [indiscernible]. Our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair spanning over 5,000 square feet, which also serves as a 200-plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events, a shared lounge at the top of the stairs, an outdoor green space and a giant food hall, all have received rave reviews from our tenants. And they complete the building's transition from showroom space to a crane Chicago called a top destination for top technology tenants and Chicago Tribune referred to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool. And we are not done yet. Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and its daily population of over 25,000, as well as a transit stop directly into the building, we're now exploring opening up a retail artisan all markets featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our website at vno.com and click on to the mark to see the images of this transformation or even better yet, ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. 
ConAgra and [indiscernible] has now moved into the building with Suntory to follow in the fall. 
For the first 6 months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8%. And we are continuing the transformation of this asset by converting it year end an additional 80,000 square feet of tradeshow space on the eighth floor to additional office space. The mark same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash. 
Turning out to San Francisco. In the second quarter, Bank of America expanded its presence in 555 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week, after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across 2 floors with McKinsey and Company, the renowned consulting firm, which is one of our long-standing tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot, we believe these 2 tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town, reaffirmed the building's status as the premier office building in San Francisco. But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off the redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrade [indiscernible] amenity spaces and, of course, multiple new food offerings. 
The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1%, reflecting the space that we recently got back when BOA vacated its original banking queue. We're now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the queue and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.
Overall for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP, 2.9% [ph] cash. These same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania Whereas Steve mentioned, business has been very weak, reflecting a day down cycle in the New York tell business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania our same-store number for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.
To conclude my remarks, let me say, we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of these reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years, we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over 1 million square feet of leases in active dialogue.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington."

The Washington D.C. metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly, for our business, 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services, including tech-related and stem sectors. 
Unemployment in the D.C. region have continued downward, is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country. In the second quarter, both Downtown D.C. and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in D.C.  Year-to-date, the numbers are showing slow, but steady absorption. 
In residential, the D.C. metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption. Notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop, the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom. 
Let me review our second quarter leasing in occupancy metric and please note all of these exclude Skyline property. We completed a 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-markets were flattish, negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3%, down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. 
Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is 2 GSA tenants who vacated, both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants, 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
And finally, residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%. 
In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June, we opened the Bartlett [ph], our new 699 unit apartment building in Pentagon City. Located directly a top Whole Foods, this 23-story building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan D.C. area. When surveyed, 67% of our residents reported that they selected the Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package, consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, validating our intense focus on the tenant experience.
The market responds to the Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renter's moved in on June 2 and through yesterday, we have leased 314 units, that's 45% of the building already. With this philosophy and rents that are higher than we projected, we are very pleased with our performance to-date. 
Meanwhile, in Crystal City, we [indiscernible] first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and is invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this mentor.
The Bartlett and WeLive brings our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro served in Georgetown and [indiscernible] Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned, in July, we received approvals to develop the next phase of the metropolitan park block, a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature [indiscernible]  style architecture coupled with Vornado signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett, will have commanding views of D.C. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.
Including this new project, we can build almost 5,600 additional apartment in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select tear downs of aging office buildings. 
In Downtown D.C, at the corner of 17th and M streets, we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building, 1700M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right.

We are in dialogue right now with probably about half of that space in terms of tenant renewals. And similarly, in terms of vacant space or space that we expect to get back, for example, we know in the second half of this year, we're going to be getting back space from U.S. Customs, which is a tenant that moved into our building after the catastrophe of 9/11 and is moving back into World Trade Center Downtown, we've got very good activity.

So I'll give you an example. I mean, we're thrilled with Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it all trip down there and take a look. It's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well-received, I think, than in the Washington district in years, in years, in years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a, give or take, a 7 and the value of that building, if you value the marketplace for first class apartment and brand new product, is x. If you divide those 2 numbers, there is a very satisfactory return on that capital. By the way, we built that building free and clear. We didn't use any debt to use that building. So the long and short of it is, and I think I said in my prepared remarks that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings, we want to build the next one immediately, the one after that quickly and more an d more and more. So we think that that's a very interesting business. Now we -- and we're excited about it. So we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly, we have the very scarce, very important land of holdings in and around the Pentagon City and in Crystal City, so if you don't have the land, you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific, very satisfactory. And we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we are extremely optimistic about the development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City. And I don't think I was bashful in my opening remarks. Now I look at this all differently. If we do separate and by the way, we have sort of, that's the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that, I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington, call it, whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it is if just moving from one pocket to the other. It well-capitalized with enough capital, I'm talking about Washington-co or the spin-co, to complete its development and complete its mission and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think that our company will do both if we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its development initiative for sure."

First off, we're very, very happy with where we are -- where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last 3, 4 years to get here. So our debt is very low. When Steve Theriot went through some of statistics, he just said casually, well,l our debt is 25%. Well 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great. Our liquidity is superb, the best in the business. And so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that, we -- evidenced by our calling a series of preferreds yesterday that the leasing that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. It doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view but it certainly increases our earnings. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, I said over the last better part of the year and a half, maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high, that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny. And that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing for first quality assets that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market, there hasn't been a hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date and the reason is that hotel business as we've discussed already is very soft. Obviously, the condo -- well, not obviously, but factually, the condo market is also soft, or not our condo, of course, but other people's condos, that's sort of a joke. But it's really not a joke, it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently -- that first-class properties are currently offered.

We completed the last 2 big deals in town, the Victoria's Secret, huge make a deal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch megadeal on Upper Fifth as well. So we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin. So 4 years ago or 5 years ago, there might have been 3 or 4 or more retailers bidding for a particular crime space on a prime street. Right now, there's barely 1 or 2. And it's difficult to close because people -- retailers are concerned, retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high, we're aware of that and obviously, we're in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the street are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is, the volumes are fine, but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be, I believe, the strongest, in my opinion, the strongest market in the city. SoHo and Broadway are softish. 34th Street is doing fine.

So what we're going to do is take the oldest, most -- the oldest building, so the oldest buildings are 40 years old, something like that, office buildings. And we have worked with the government powers that be so that in general, we can take down an older building and we build a building, which is 150% the size of that or something like that, okay? So the financial analysis goes like this. You take this 40-year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to lid it with the understanding that, that capital will have to be amortized over, pick a number, a 10-year lease and at the end of that 10-year lease, that 40 year-old building is now 50 years old, so that's one column of numbers and concept. The second column is you take it down, build a brand-new residential building which will have, which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just a matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand-new first-class residential product is a very, very profitable and good trade. In addition to that, the -- when you get thousands of units in a tight cluster you get a community and that creates more value and we know how to create that community and amenitize it and make it so that people will consider this a very, very fine place to live thinking about where it is, where it's located, where jobs are, the metro access of it and by the way, it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall, which is 1 of the top 10 malls in the country and the Whole Foods, et cetera.

So the basic and by the way, and the basis that we have in our building says go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary. So you have all that as a backdrop. Now the way we look at it, let's take and cut it into bite-size pieces. So take 1 Penn and to ban, which together are 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published you know where they are, they, the first digit is a 5 and we believe that notwithstanding anything else, we can transform those buildings in this marketplace so that the average starting rent will be higher, [indiscernible] to math now but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's a capital program, and we're going to do that and that's actually the #1 priority of what we're about. And then there's development, the retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary. And then we've got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have, I think, very intelligently delayed up until now. And so you have it. We do is we take -- we leg into the project piece-by-piece.

Having said that, in the Pentagon, Crystal City market, we really control a substantial amount of the development pipeline. There are some other projects, there are some other units, but not a significant amount over the pipeline period that we're thinking about.

So at 220 South Central Park, you seem to be especially interested in, we have the best site, we have the best project, we have the best design, et cetera, but as importantly, we bring a 2% cost of capital to that project. We are competing against people up and down the block, in fact, all over the place, that are paying 12% and 15% for money as you can imagine, it's not a fair fight, okay? In Crystal City and Pentagon City, my thinking is not dissimilar to that. We own great land parcels and so I look upon that right now as being a sub-cost. We have the capital to build and develop and this is different than office buildings. If you put up 300,000 to 400,000, 500,000 office building and you catch a weak market, the building either stays a vacant for year-after-year for by your by the way there's dozen of example of that in the Washington region or you have to take the price down to a number, which locks in a huge loss. Residential development is different than fact and that is if of a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side, you sign a long-term lease and you're locked in to that price, good or bad, for a very long time. In the residential business, the rents, will fluctuate with the market and so over time, you're able to get what the market is the market think is that a fair rent. So they're very different. We will be aggressive in building on the land that we already own there, that's our business plan."

We also have a residential portfolio in Manhattan, which is performing quite well and that is a business with the correct entry point that we would invest in.

Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south,",981,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. 
Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south, our Hotel Pennsylvania included suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for Farley and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza district in the very center of the new West Side are the next big thing, actually, really big thing for our company. 
We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development in progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every 4 days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue, which will be the new home of a 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our High Line project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and at 606 Broadway construction has begun. 
In Washington, at Pentagon City, the Whole Foods and the 699 unit apartment has opened, achieving an extraordinary 45% lease up in just the first 2 months, way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City, WeWork WeLive has also open achieving 80% occupancy of the 2/3 of the units that are open. 
The success of the apartments validates our plan to emphasize residential newbuilds on our nearby vacant land inventory and on select sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Over time, we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to the apartments immediately. 
So in Crystal City, Pentagon City, our business plan is residential heavy and newbuild heavy, all while we continue to grow our office income. 
A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter, the financing markets have settled down. We are in a borrower's market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher, however, is the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has gapped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, new hotels, and speculative development in New York, which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us. 
In the transactions market after a record-breaking year in 2015, volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors: Volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high-quality product, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high-quality office retail and multifamily product, though bidding pools have somewhat bid. Capital continues to aggressively pursue in New York, which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the U.S. and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue and believe this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York. 
A couple of comps that worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway, a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway, a couple of blocks from our Penn plaza holdings went under contract to a private foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilized yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located and much higher quality.
As a retail comp, 155 Mercer Street, a retail condo in SoHo occupied by Dolce and Gabbana recently went under contract to a private investor group for $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. 
Finally, pricing at San Francisco continues to set records, 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square foot new building near Transbay center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square foot. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco, 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark. 
In May, we completed a $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million, of which $159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and $43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The tax gain was $90 million, we continue to manage and lease the property.
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the second quarter, we leased 1,025,000 square feet in 97 transactions. In New York, we leased 544,000 square feet of office space, including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island city. The average starting rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island city was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. 
In Washington, we leased 369,000 square feet, but mark-to-markets excluding Skyline were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash.
Yesterday, we called for redemption on our 6 7/8  Series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded out of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activities."

As we previewed on last quarter's call, this quarter -- this year's second quarter has some accounting noise, which masks the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me take you through the math. In our New York business, the quarter's results include $7.9 million of noncash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight-line rent receivables triggered by our early termination of New York office leases, primarily J.Crew and Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One at 90 Park Avenue, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable reduces our GAAP earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future period earnings. 
Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year second quarter, remember that the prior year's second quarter included $5.4 million of noncash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison, again, to clear out space for higher-paying tenants. 
In addition, as David will explain shortly, the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by $5.1 million. The punchline is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison of growth of our New York core earnings by $18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items, New York's earnings grew by $28.2 million or 11.1%. 
We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me comment on our fad ratio, which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last 2 years is occurring ahead of the commencement of the $216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8-K dated June 7, 2016. 
Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter, in addition to the $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned, we completed a $273 million refinancing of the Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington D.C. office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as a fixed rate of 3.65% is interest-only for the first 2 years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 3. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%, $293 million mortgage. 
Also in the quarter, at 280 Park Avenue, the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture, we completed a $900 million refinancing. The 3-year loan with 4, 1-year options is interest-only at LIBOR plus 2% -- 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $725 million mortgage.
We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's crossroads, Virginia. The loan is recoursed only to these Skyline properties. 
In the second quarter, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default, causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental default rate of interest. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we accrued at $2.7 million of default interest expense. 
Excluding Skyline, our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $593.6 million consisting primarily of the $550 million, 5.57% mart loan, which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. 
Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $75.6 million. 
Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed-rate debt accounted for 73% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and floating rate debt accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years. Debt-to-enterprise value is 24%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.2x Including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys""R""Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have $4.3 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum."
312648,318294855,1021632,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you. I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprised Brexit v",1730,"Steve, thank you. I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprised Brexit vote. Despite the disruptive potential of these 2 events, the stock market has been resilient. While many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets as ""Moving sideways"" the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing has at first 6 months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet comparable to 10-year averages, although activity was largely driven by renewals. Importantly, sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in 8 years. 
On prior calls, we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of the TAMI sector making the city less reliant on a traditional financial services sector. Interestingly, this year, we have seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the health care sector, which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services. Just recently, NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building, which is less than 15 years old had been occupied by a prominent law firm. 
While not typically considered a large occupier of office space, over the last 5 years, some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined health care and education sectors. And we at Vornado have a significant share of those operations. With Colombia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, NYU Langone at One Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue, a total of 700,000 square feet of health care operations. 
Ultimately, the key to our market is jobs, specifically office using jobs. For the first 6 months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high. At 5%, the city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. 
Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to Verizon strike. 2 months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.
Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well-positioned. On the office side, we have 8 trophy buildings that command $100 plus rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West side, including Penn Plaza and Chelsea where tenants increasingly want to be. We have completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last 3 years totaling 6.5 million square feet ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopments in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet.
On the street retail side, our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the Bowtie and Times Square, Madison Avenue, SoHo and 34th Street. 
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96% in a 544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activity, some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67, representing mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue, which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redeveloped asset. The balance of our leasing activity this quarter, some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of 2 leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island city. These leases at starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect a rapidly changing Long Island city landscape, representing mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place, the yield on our investment in this building is now 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the releasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.
For the first 6 months of the year, we closed 6 of Crain's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue; Facebook and AOL, Verizon at 770 Broadway; Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue; and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. 
I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio. We continue to see that in our ability to make than our fair share of deals of $100 plus per square foot. In the second quarter, we signed 3 such leases, a total of 34,500 square feet at the average starting rents of $143 per foot. Year-to-date, we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet. 
In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity and 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the 4 Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search, the 4 Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue as the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly 6 decades at the Seagram  building. The new restaurant, when it opens in late 2017 will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program, a clear sign of our success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue. 
At 692 Broadway, AOL signed a 10,000 square foot lease for a new experiential concept, a studio space for the Huffington Post live interview series. And in 11 Penn Plaza, MSG Networks renewed some [indiscernible]  square feet of studio space on the ground floor and lower level. Our largest and best in class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago. In June, we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and second floors. It's a wow. Our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair spanning over 5,000 square feet, which also serves as a 200-plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events, a shared lounge at the top of the stairs, an outdoor green space and a giant food hall, all have received rave reviews from our tenants and they complete the building's transition from showroom space to what Crain's Chicago called a top destination for technology tenants and Chicago Tribune referred to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool and we are not done yet. Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and its daily population of over 25,000 as well as a transit stop directly into the building, we're now exploring opening up a retail artisanal markets featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our website at vno.com and click on to theMART to see the images of this transformation or even better yet, ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. 
ConAgra and Allstate have now moved into the building with Beam Suntory to follow in the flow. 
For the first 6 months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8%. And we are continuing the transformation of this asset by converting at year end an additional 80,000 square feet of tradeshow space on the eighth floor to additional office space. TheMART's same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash. 
Turning now to San Francisco. In the second quarter, Bank of America expanded its presence in 555 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week, after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across 2 floors with McKinsey and Company, the renowned consulting firm, which is one of our long standing tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot, we believe these 2 tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town, reaffirm the building's status as the premier office building in San Francisco. But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off a redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrade [indiscernible] amenity spaces and of course, multiple new food offerings. 
The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1%, reflecting the space that we recently got back when BOA vacated its original banking cube. We are now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the cube and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.
Overall for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP, 2.9% [ph] cash. These same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania where as Steve mentioned, business has been very weak, reflecting the down cycle in the New York Hotel business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same-store numbers for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.
To conclude my remarks, let me say, we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of these reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years, we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over 1 million square feet of leases in active dialogue.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington."

The Washington D.C. metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly, for our business, 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services, including tech-related and stem sectors. 
Unemployment in the D.C. region has continued downward, is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country. In the second quarter, both Downtown D.C. and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in D.C.  Year-to-date, the numbers are showing slow, but steady absorption. 
In residential, the D.C. metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption. Notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop, the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom. 
Let me review our second quarter leasing and occupancy metrics and please note all of these exclude Skyline property. We completed a 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-markets were flattish, negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3%, down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. 
Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is 2 GSA tenants who vacated, both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants, 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
And finally, residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%. 
In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June, we opened the Bartlett, our new 699 unit apartment building in Pentagon City. Located directly a top a new 40,000 square feet Whole Foods, this 23-story building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan D.C. area. When surveyed, 67% of our residents reported they selected the Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package, consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, validating our intense focus on the tenant experience.
The market response to the Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renter's moved in on June 2 and through yesterday, we have leased 314 units, that's 45% of the building already. With this philosophy and rents that are higher than we projected, we are very pleased with our performance to-date. 
Meanwhile, in Crystal City, WeWork opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and is invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this venture.
The Bartlett and WeLive bring our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro served in Georgetown and [indiscernible] Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned, in July, we received approvals to develop the next phase of the metropolitan park block, a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature [indiscernible]  style architecture coupled with Vornado's signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett, will have commanding views of D.C. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.
Including this new project, we can build almost 5,600 additional apartment in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select teardowns of aging office buildings. 
In Downtown D.C, at the corner of 17th and M streets, we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building, 1700M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right.

For example, we know in the second half of this year, we're going to be getting back space from U.S. Customs, which is a tenant that moved into our building after the catastrophe of 9/11 and is moving back into World Trade Center Downtown. We've got very good activity. So I don't think -- Steve, unless we want to say anything specifically about the bridge, I don't think there's anything material to talk about in terms of that number."

So I'll give you an example. I mean, we've been -- we're thrilled with this Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it you want to make a trip down there and take a look. So it's a -- it's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well-received, I think, done  in the Washington District in years and years and years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a, give or take, a 7 and the value of that building, if you value the marketplace for first class apartment and brand new product, is X. If you divide those 2 numbers, there is a very satisfactory return on that capital. By the way, we built that building free and clear. We didn't use any debt to build that building. So the long and short of it is, and I think I said in my prepared remarks that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings. We want to build the next one immediately, the one after that quickly and more and more and more. So we think that that's a very interesting business. Now we -- and we're excited about it. So we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly, we have the very scarce, very important land holdings in and around the Pentagon City and in Crystal City. So if you don't have the land, you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific, very satisfactory. And we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we are extremely optimistic about development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City. I don't think I was bashful in my opening remarks. Now I look at this all differently. I -- if we do separate -- and by the way, we have sort of, that's the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that, I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington, call it, whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it as if we're just moving from one pocket to the other. It will be well capitalized with enough capital. I'm talking about Washington-co or the SpinCo to complete its development and complete its mission, and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think that our company will do both. If we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its development initiative for sure."

First off, we're very, very happy with where we are -- where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last 3, 4 years to get here. So our debt is very low. When Steve Theriot went through some of the statistics, he just said casually, well, our debt is 25%. Well, 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great. Our liquidity is superb, the best in the business. And so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that, we -- evidenced by our calling a series of preferreds yesterday that, we think, that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. It doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view, but it certainly increases our earnings. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, I said over the last better part of 1.5 years maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high, that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny. And that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing for first-quality assets that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market. There hasn't been a hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date, and the reason is that hotel business, as we've discussed already, is very soft. Obviously, the condo -- well, not obviously, but factually, the condo market is also soft -- not our condo, of course, but other people's condos. That's sort of a joke. But it's really not a joke, it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently -- that first-class properties are currently offered.

We're not in the hope business, we're in the realistic business. And so we believe rents have gotten to the point where they are too high, and retailers are not comfortable paying those rents. So that's step one. The second part of it is our retail portfolio is pretty full -- very full, actually. We completed the last 2 big deals in town: The Victoria's Secret, huge megadeal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch megadeal on Upper Fifth as well. So we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin. So 4 years ago or 5 years ago, there might have been 3 or 4 or more retailers bidding for a particular prime space on a prime street. Right now, there's barely 1 or 2. And they're difficult to close because people -- retailers are concerned. Retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high. We're aware of that, and obviously, we're in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the Street are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is the volumes are fine, but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be, I believe, the strongest, in my opinion -- the strongest market in the city. SoHo and Broadway are softish. 34th Street is doing fine.

So the oldest buildings are 40 years old, something like that, office buildings. And we have worked with the government powers that be so that in general, we can take down an older building and we build a building, which is 150% the size of that or something like that, okay? So the financial analysis goes like this. You take this 40-year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to lid it with the understanding that, that capital will have to be amortized over, pick a number, a 10-year lease and at the end of that 10-year lease, that 40 year-old building is now 50 years old. So that's one column of numbers and concept. The second column is you take it down, build a brand new residential building, which will have -- which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just a matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand new first-class residential product is a very, very profitable and good trade. In addition to that, the -- when you get thousands of units in a tight cluster, you get a community and that creates more value. And we know how to create that community and amenitize it and make it so that people will consider this a very, very fine place to live thinking about where it is, where it's located to, where jobs are, the metro access of it. And by the way, it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall, which is 1 of the top 10 malls in the country, and the Whole Foods, et cetera.

So we've got $1 billion Macy's and Madison Square Garden and we sit on top of the Station. We don't sit 4 blocks away and you have to walk to it in the rain, we sit on top of it. So the basic -- and by the way, the basis that we have in our buildings is you go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary. So you have all that as a backdrop. Now the way we look at it, let's take and cut it into bite-size pieces. So take 1 Penn and 2 Penn, which together are 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published. You know what they are. They -- the first digit is a 5, and we believe that notwithstanding anything else, we can transform those buildings in this marketplace, so that the average starting rent will be higher. I don't want to get into math now, but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's a capital program, and we're going to do that and that's actually the #1 priority of what we're about. And then there's peripheral development. The retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary. And then we've got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have, I think, very intelligently delayed up until now. And so you know where you have it. We do is we take -- we leg into the project piece by piece. Now with respect to the overall amount of capital that we will be committing to this district, it's 8 million, 9 million feet.  It's huge, it's enormous, it all has very large paybacks and the most important part of it is Vornado is a fortress, financially, and has the capital ability to finance all this.

There are some other projects, there are some other units, but not a significant amount over the pipeline period that we're thinking about. So we have the opportunity to both build quality product, measure the demand, meet the demand and also modulate the supply as we see it. So we're very comfortable with our position and with our program at this point."

So at 220 Central Park South, which you seem to be especially interested in, we have the best site, we have the best project, we have the best design, et cetera. But as importantly, we bring a 2% cost of capital to that project. We are competing against people up and down the block, in fact, all over the place that are paying 12% and 15% for money as you can imagine, it's not a fair fight, okay? In Crystal City and Pentagon City, my thinking is not this similar to that. We own great land parcels and so I look upon that right now as being some cost. We have the capital to build and develop, and this is different than office buildings. If you put up 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 square foot big office building and you catch a weak market, the building either stays vacant for year after year after year. By the way, there's dozens of example of that in the Washington region or you have to take the price down to a number, which marks it a huge loss. Residential development is different than that, and that is if for a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side of the light you saw in a long-term lease and you're locked in to that price, good or bad, for a very long time. In the residential business, the rents will fluctuate with the market, and so over time, you're able to get what the market is -- the market thinks is the fair rent. So they're very different. We will be aggressive in building on the land that we already own there. That's our business plan."

Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south,",982,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. 
Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south, our Hotel Pennsylvania included, suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for Farley and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza district in the very center of the new West Side are the next big thing, actually, really big thing for our company. 
We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development in progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every 4 days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue, which will be the new home of a 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our High Line project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and at 606 Broadway construction has begun. 
In Washington, at Pentagon City, the Whole Foods and the 699 unit apartment have opened, achieving an extraordinary 45% lease up in just the first 2 months, way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City, WeWork WeLive has also opened, achieving 80% occupancy of the 2/3 of the units that are open. 
The success of the apartments validates our plan to emphasize residential newbuilds on our nearby vacant land inventory and on select sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Over time, we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to the apartments immediately. 
So in Crystal City, Pentagon City, our business plan is residential heavy and newbuild heavy, all while we continue to grow our office income. 
A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter, the financing markets have settled down. We are in a borrower's market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher, however, is the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has gapped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, new hotels, and speculative development in New York, which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us. 
In the transactions market after a record-breaking year in 2015, volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors: Volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high-quality product, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high-quality office retail and multifamily product, though bidding pools have somewhat bid. Capital continues to aggressively pursue in New York, which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the U.S. and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue and believe this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York. 
A couple of comps that are worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway, a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway, a couple of blocks from our Penn plaza holdings went under contract to a private foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilized yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located and much higher quality.
As a retail comp, 155 Mercer Street, a retail condo in SoHo occupied by Dolce and Gabbana recently went under contract to a private investor group for $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. 
Finally, pricing in San Francisco continues to set records, 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square foot new building near Transbay Center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square foot. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco, 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark. 
In May, we completed a $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million, of which $159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and $43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The tax gain was $90 million, we continue to manage and lease the property.
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the second quarter, we leased 1,025,000 square feet in 97 transactions. In New York, we leased 544,000 square feet of office space, including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island city. The average starting rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island city was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. 
In Washington, we leased 369,000 square feet, but mark-to-markets excluding Skyline were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash.
Yesterday, we called for redemption on our 6 7/8  Series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded out of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activities."
312648,318294855,1021833,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share",850,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share as compared to $1.26 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we previewed on last quarter's call, this quarter -- this year's second quarter has some accounting noise, which masks the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me take you through the math. In our New York business, the quarter's results include $7.9 million of noncash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight-line rent receivables triggered by our early termination of New York office leases, primarily J.Crew and Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One at 90 Park Avenue, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable reduces our GAAP earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future period earnings. 
Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year second quarter, remember that the prior year's second quarter included $5.4 million of noncash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison, again, to clear out space for higher-paying tenants. 
In addition, as David will explain shortly, the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by $5.1 million. The punchline is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison of growth of our New York core earnings by $18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items, New York's earnings grew by $28.2 million or 11.1%. 
We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me comment on our fad ratio, which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last 2 years is occurring ahead of the commencement of the $216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8-K dated June 7, 2016. 
Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter, in addition to the $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned, we completed a $273 million refinancing of the Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington D.C. office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as a fixed rate of 3.65% is interest-only for the first 2 years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 3. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%, $293 million mortgage. 
Also in the quarter, at 280 Park Avenue, the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture, we completed a $900 million refinancing. The 3-year loan with 4, 1-year options is interest-only at LIBOR plus 2% -- 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $725 million mortgage.
We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's crossroads, Virginia. The loan is recoursed only to these Skyline properties. 
In the second quarter, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default, causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental default rate of interest. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we accrued $2.7 million of default interest expense. 
Excluding Skyline, our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $593.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million, 5.57% Mart loan, which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. 
Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $75.6 million. 
Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed-rate debt accounted for 73% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and floating rate debt accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years. Debt-to-enterprise value is 24%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.2x including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys""R""Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have $4.3 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum."
312648,318294855,1021833,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you.

I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprise Brexit vote. Despite the disruptive potential of these 2 events, the stock market has been resilient. While many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets as ""Moving sideways"" the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing has at first 6 months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet comparable to 10-year averages, although activity was largely driven by renewals. Importantly, sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in 8 years. 
On prior calls, we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of the TAMI sector making the city less reliant on the traditional financial services sector. Interestingly, this year, we have seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the health care sector, which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services. Just recently, NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building, which is less than 15 years old, had been occupied by a prominent law firm. 
While not typically considered a large occupier of office space, over the last 5 years, some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined health care and education sectors. And we at Vornado have a significant share of those operations, with Colombia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, NYU Langone at One Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue, a total of 700,000 square feet of health care operations. 
Ultimately, the key to our market is jobs, specifically office using jobs. For the first 6 months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high. At 5%, the city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. 
Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to the Verizon strike. 2 months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.
Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well positioned. On the office side, we have 8 trophy buildings that command $100 plus rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West side, including Penn Plaza and Chelsea, where tenants increasingly want to be. We have completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last 3 years totaling 6.5 million square feet, ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopments in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet.
On the street retail side, our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the Bowtie in Times Square, Madison Avenue, SoHo and 34th Street. 
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96% in 544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activity, some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67, representing mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue, which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redeveloped asset. The balance of our leasing activity this quarter, some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of 2 leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island city. These leases at starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect a rapidly changing Long Island city landscape, representing mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place, the yield on our investment in this building is now 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the re-leasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.
For the first 6 months of the year, we closed 6 of Crain's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue; Facebook and AOL, Verizon at 770 Broadway; Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue; and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. 
I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio. We continue to see that in our ability to make more than our fair share of deals of $100 plus per square foot. In the second quarter, we signed 3 such leases, a total of 34,500 square feet at the average starting rents of $143 per foot. Year-to-date, we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet. 
In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity and 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the 4 Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search, the 4 Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue as the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly 6 decades at the Seagram’s building. The new restaurant, when it opens in late 2017, will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program, a clear sign of our success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue. 
At 692 Broadway, AOL signed a 10,000 square foot lease for a new experiential concept, a studio space for the Huffington Post live interview series. And at 11 Penn Plaza, MSG Networks renewed some [indiscernible]  square feet of studio space on the ground floor and lower level. Our largest and best in class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago. In June, we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors. It's a wow. Our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair spanning over 5,000 square feet, which also serves as a 200-plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events, a shared lounge at the top of the stairs, an outdoor green space and a giant food hall, all have received rave reviews from our tenants and they complete the building's transition from showroom space to what Crain's Chicago called a top destination for technology tenants and Chicago Tribune referred to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool, and we are not done yet. Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and its daily population of over 25,000 as well as a transit stop directly into the building, we're now exploring opening up a retail artisanal market featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our website at vno.com and click on to theMART to see the images of this transformation or even better yet, ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. 
ConAgra and Allstate have now moved into the building with Beam Suntory to follow in the fall. 
For the first 6 months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8%. And we are continuing the transformation of this asset by converting at year-end an additional 80,000 square feet of tradeshow space on the eighth floor to additional office space. TheMART's same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash. 
Turning now to San Francisco. In the second quarter, Bank of America expanded its presence in 555 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week, after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across 2 floors with McKinsey and Company, the renowned consulting firm, which is one of our long standing tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot, we believe these 2 tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town, reaffirm the building's status as the premier office building in San Francisco. But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off a redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrade to tenant amenity spaces and of course, multiple new food offerings. 
The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1%, reflecting the space that we recently got back when BOA vacated its original banking cube. We are now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the cube and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.
Overall for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP, 2.9% [ph] cash. These same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania where, as Steve mentioned, business has been very weak, reflecting the down cycle in the New York Hotel business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.
To conclude my remarks, let me say, we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of these reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years, we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over 1 million square feet of leases in active dialogue.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington."

The Washington D.C. metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly, for our business, 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services, including tech-related and stem sectors. 
Unemployment in the D.C. region has continued downward, is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country. In the second quarter, both Downtown D.C. and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in D.C.  Year-to-date, the numbers are showing slow but steady absorption. 
In residential, the D.C. metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption. Notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop, the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom. 
Let me review our second quarter leasing and occupancy metrics and please note all of these exclude Skyline property. We completed 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-markets were flattish, negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3%, down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. 
Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is 2 GSA tenants who vacated, both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants, 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
And finally, residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%. 
In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June, we opened the Bartlett, our new 699 unit apartment building in Pentagon City. Located directly atop a new 40,000 square feet Whole Foods, this 23-story building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan D.C. area. When surveyed, 67% of our residents reported they selected the Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package, consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, validating our intense focus on the tenant experience.
The market response to the Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renter's moved in on June 2 and through yesterday, we have leased 314 units, that's 45% of the building already. With this philosophy and rents that are higher than we projected, we are very pleased with our performance to-date. 
Meanwhile, in Crystal City, WeWork opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into a WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and is invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this venture.
The Bartlett and WeLive bring our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro served in Georgetown and close in Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned, in July, we received approvals to develop the next phase of the metropolitan park block, a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature [indiscernible]  style architecture coupled with Vornado's signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett, will have commanding views of D.C. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.
Including this new project, we can build almost 5,600 additional apartments in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select teardowns of aging office buildings. 
In Downtown D.C, at the corner of 17th and M streets, we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building, 1700M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right.

So I'll give you an example. I mean, we've been -- we're thrilled with this Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it you ought to make a trip down there and take a look. So it's a -- it's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well-received, I think, done  in the Washington District in years and years and years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a, give or take, a 7 and the value of that building, if you value the marketplace for first class apartment and brand new product, is X. If you divide those 2 numbers, there is a very satisfactory return on that capital. By the way, we built that building free and clear. We didn't use any debt to build that building. So the long and the short of it is, and I think I said in my prepared remarks, that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings. We want to build the next one immediately, the one after that quickly and more and more and more. So we think that, that's a very interesting business. Now we -- and we're excited about it. So we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly, we have the very scarce, very important land holdings in and around the Pentagon City and in Crystal City. So if you don't have the land, you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific, very satisfactory. And we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we are extremely optimistic about development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City. I don't think I was bashful in my opening remarks. Now I look at this all differently. I -- if we do separate -- and by the way, we have sort of -- that's the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that, I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington, call it whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it as if we're just moving from one pocket to the other. It will be well capitalized with enough capital. I'm talking about Washington-co or the SpinCo to complete its development and complete its mission, and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think that our company will do both. If we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its development initiative for sure."

First off, we're very, very happy with where we are -- where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last 3, 4 years to get here. So our debt is very low. When Steve Theriot went through some of the statistics, he just said casually, well, our debt is 25%. Well, 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great. Our liquidity is superb, the best in the business. And so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that, we -- evidenced by our calling a series of preferreds yesterday that, we think, that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. It doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view, but it certainly increases our earnings. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, I said over the last better part of 1.5 years maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high, that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny. And that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing for first-quality assets that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market. There hasn't been a hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date, and the reason is that hotel business, as we've discussed already, is very soft. Obviously, the condo -- well, not obviously, but factually, the condo market is also soft -- not our condo, of course, but other people's condos. That's sort of a joke. But it's really not a joke, it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently -- that first-class properties are currently offered. And so I think that's where we are. Now these markets are volatile, they can change. We are ready for whatever happens. And I think there you have it, my friend."

We're not in the hope business, we're in the realistic business. And so we believe rents have gotten to the point where they are too high, and retailers are not comfortable paying those rents. So that's step one. The second part of it is our retail portfolio is pretty full -- very full, actually. We completed the last 2 big deals in town: The Victoria's Secret, huge megadeal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch megadeal on Upper Fifth as well. So we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin. So 4 years ago or 5 years ago, there might have been 3 or 4 or more retailers bidding for a particular prime space on a prime street. Right now, there's barely 1 or 2. And they're difficult to close because people -- retailers are concerned. Retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high. We're aware of that, and obviously, we're in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the street are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is the volumes are fine, but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be, I believe, the strongest, in my opinion -- the strongest market in the city. SoHo and Broadway are softish. 34th Street is doing fine.

So if you take those buildings and look at what we can build as a result of the Crystal City sector plan, we have almost 2 million square feet on that 500,000 plus square feet of what's built at the moment. And each of those sites could handle, ultimately, up to 1,000 apartment units. So I think, we think, that it is -- it makes all good economic sense.

So the oldest buildings are 40 years old, something like that, office buildings. And we have worked with the government powers that be so that in general, we can take down an older building and we build a building, which is 150% the size of that or something like that, okay? So the financial analysis goes like this. Do you take this 40-year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to let it with the understanding that, that capital will have to be amortized over, pick a number, a 10-year lease and at the end of that 10-year lease, that 40 year-old building is now 50 years old. So that's one column of numbers and concept. The second column is you take it down, build a brand new residential building, which will have -- which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just a matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand new first-class residential product is a very, very profitable and good trade. In addition to that, the -- when you get thousands of units in a tight cluster, you get a community and that creates more value. And we know how to create that community and amenitize it and make it so that people will consider this a very, very fine place to live, thinking about where it is, where it's located to, where jobs are, the metro access of it. And by the way, it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall, which is 1 of the top 10 malls in the country, and the Whole Foods, et cetera.

So we've got $1 billion Macy's and Madison Square Garden and we sit on top of the Station. We don't sit 4 blocks away and you have to walk to it in the rain, we sit on top of it. So the basic -- and by the way, the basis that we have in our buildings is you go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary. So you have all that as a backdrop. Now the way we look at it, let's take and cut it into bite-size pieces. So take 1 Penn and 2 Penn, which together are 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published. You know what they are. They -- the first digit is a 5, and we believe that notwithstanding anything else, we can transform those buildings in this marketplace, so that the average starting rent will be higher. I don't want to get into math now, but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's a capital program, and we're going to do that and that's actually the #1 priority of what we're about. And then there's peripheral development. The retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary. And then we've got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have, I think, very intelligently delayed up until now. And so you know where you have it. We do is we take -- we leg into the project piece by piece. Now with respect to the overall amount of capital that we will be committing to this district, it's 8 million, 9 million feet.

If you put up 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 square foot big office building and you catch a weak market, the building either stays vacant for year after year after year. By the way, there's dozens of example of that in the Washington region, or you have to take the price down to a number, which marks it a huge loss. Residential development is different than that, and that is if for a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side of the light you sign a long-term lease and you're locked in to that price, good or bad, for a very long time. In the residential business, the rents will fluctuate with the market, and so over time, you're able to get what the market is -- the market thinks is the fair rent. So they're very different. We will be aggressive in building on the land that we already own there. That's our business plan."

We also have a residential portfolio in Manhattan, which is performing quite well and that is a business with the correct entry point that we would invest in, although we do not have anywhere near the scale in that business that we have in office and it retail.

Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south,",982,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. 
Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south, our Hotel Pennsylvania included, suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for Farley and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza district in the very center of the new West Side are the next big thing, actually, really big thing for our company. 
We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development in progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every 4 days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue, which will be the new home of a 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our High Line project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and at 606 Broadway construction has begun. 
In Washington, at Pentagon City, the Whole Foods and the 699 unit apartment have opened, achieving an extraordinary 45% lease up in just the first 2 months, way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City, WeWork WeLive has also opened, achieving 80% occupancy of the 2/3 of the units that are open. 
The success of the apartments validates our plan to emphasize residential newbuilds on our nearby vacant land inventory and on select sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Over time, we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to the apartments immediately. 
So in Crystal City, Pentagon City, our business plan is residential heavy and newbuild heavy, all while we continue to grow our office income. 
A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter, the financing markets have settled down. We are in a borrower's market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher, however, is the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has gapped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, new hotels, and speculative development in New York, which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us. 
In the transactions market after a record-breaking year in 2015, volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors: Volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high-quality product, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high-quality office retail and multifamily product, though bidding pools have somewhat bid. Capital continues to aggressively pursue in New York, which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the U.S. and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue and believe this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York. 
A couple of comps that are worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway, a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway, a couple of blocks from our Penn plaza holdings went under contract to a private foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilized yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located and much higher quality.
As a retail comp, 155 Mercer Street, a retail condo in SoHo occupied by Dolce and Gabbana recently went under contract to a private investor group for $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. 
Finally, pricing in San Francisco continues to set records, 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square foot new building near Transbay Center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square foot. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco, 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark. 
In May, we completed a $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million, of which $159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and $43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The tax gain was $90 million, we continue to manage and lease the property.
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the second quarter, we leased 1,025,000 square feet in 97 transactions. In New York, we leased 544,000 square feet of office space, including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island city. The average starting rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island city was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. 
In Washington, we leased 369,000 square feet, but mark-to-markets excluding Skyline were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash.
Yesterday, we called for redemption on our 6 7/8  Series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded out of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activities."
312648,318294855,1022309,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share",850,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share as compared to $1.26 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we previewed on last quarter's call, this quarter -- this year's second quarter has some accounting noise, which masks the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me take you through the math. In our New York business, the quarter's results include $7.9 million of noncash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight-line rent receivables triggered by our early termination of New York office leases, primarily J.Crew and Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One at 90 Park Avenue, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable reduces our GAAP earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future period earnings. 
Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year second quarter, remember that the prior year's second quarter included $5.4 million of noncash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison, again, to clear out space for higher-paying tenants. 
In addition, as David will explain shortly, the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by $5.1 million. The punchline is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison of growth of our New York core earnings by $18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items, New York's earnings grew by $28.2 million or 11.1%. 
We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me comment on our fad ratio, which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last 2 years is occurring ahead of the commencement of the $216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8-K dated June 7, 2016. 
Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter, in addition to the $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned, we completed a $273 million refinancing of the Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington D.C. office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as a fixed rate of 3.65% is interest-only for the first 2 years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 3. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%, $293 million mortgage. 
Also in the quarter, at 280 Park Avenue, the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture, we completed a $900 million refinancing. The 3-year loan with 4, 1-year options is interest-only at LIBOR plus 2% -- 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $725 million mortgage.
We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's crossroads, Virginia. The loan is recoursed only to these Skyline properties. 
In the second quarter, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default, causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental default rate of interest. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we accrued $2.7 million of default interest expense. 
Excluding Skyline, our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $593.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million, 5.57% Mart loan, which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. 
Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $75.6 million. 
Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed-rate debt accounted for 73% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and floating rate debt accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years. Debt-to-enterprise value is 24%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.2x including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys""R""Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have $4.3 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum."
312648,318294855,1022309,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you.

I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprise Brexit vote. Despite the disruptive potential of these 2 events, the stock market has been resilient. While many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets as ""Moving sideways"" the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing has at first 6 months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet comparable to 10-year averages, although activity was largely driven by renewals. Importantly, sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in 8 years. 
On prior calls, we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of the TAMI sector making the city less reliant on the traditional financial services sector. Interestingly, this year, we have seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the health care sector, which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services. Just recently, NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building, which is less than 15 years old, had been occupied by a prominent law firm. 
While not typically considered a large occupier of office space, over the last 5 years, some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined health care and education sectors. And we at Vornado have a significant share of those operations, with Colombia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, NYU Langone at One Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue, a total of 700,000 square feet of health care operations. 
Ultimately, the key to our market is jobs, specifically office using jobs. For the first 6 months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high. At 5%, the city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. 
Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to the Verizon strike. 2 months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.
Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well positioned. On the office side, we have 8 trophy buildings that command $100 plus rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West side, including Penn Plaza and Chelsea, where tenants increasingly want to be. We have completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last 3 years totaling 6.5 million square feet, ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopments in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet.
On the street retail side, our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the Bowtie in Times Square, Madison Avenue, SoHo and 34th Street. 
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96% in 544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activity, some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67, representing mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue, which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redeveloped asset. The balance of our leasing activity this quarter, some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of 2 leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island city. These leases at starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect a rapidly changing Long Island city landscape, representing mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place, the yield on our investment in this building is now 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the re-leasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.
For the first 6 months of the year, we closed 6 of Crain's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue; Facebook and AOL, Verizon at 770 Broadway; Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue; and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. 
I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio. We continue to see that in our ability to make more than our fair share of deals of $100 plus per square foot. In the second quarter, we signed 3 such leases, a total of 34,500 square feet at the average starting rents of $143 per foot. Year-to-date, we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet. 
In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity and 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the 4 Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search, the 4 Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue as the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly 6 decades at the Seagram’s building. The new restaurant, when it opens in late 2017, will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program, a clear sign of our success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue. 
At 692 Broadway, AOL signed a 10,000 square foot lease for a new experiential concept, a studio space for the Huffington Post live interview series. And at 11 Penn Plaza, MSG Networks renewed some [indiscernible]  square feet of studio space on the ground floor and lower level. Our largest and best in class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago. In June, we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors. It's a wow. Our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair spanning over 5,000 square feet, which also serves as a 200-plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events, a shared lounge at the top of the stairs, an outdoor green space and a giant food hall, all have received rave reviews from our tenants and they complete the building's transition from showroom space to what Crain's Chicago called a top destination for technology tenants and Chicago Tribune referred to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool, and we are not done yet. Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and its daily population of over 25,000 as well as a transit stop directly into the building, we're now exploring opening up a retail artisanal market featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our website at vno.com and click on to theMART to see the images of this transformation or even better yet, ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. 
ConAgra and Allstate have now moved into the building with Beam Suntory to follow in the fall. 
For the first 6 months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8%. And we are continuing the transformation of this asset by converting at year-end an additional 80,000 square feet of tradeshow space on the eighth floor to additional office space. TheMART's same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash. 
Turning now to San Francisco. In the second quarter, Bank of America expanded its presence in 555 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week, after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across 2 floors with McKinsey and Company, the renowned consulting firm, which is one of our long standing tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot, we believe these 2 tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town, reaffirm the building's status as the premier office building in San Francisco. But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off a redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrade to tenant amenity spaces and of course, multiple new food offerings. 
The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1%, reflecting the space that we recently got back when BOA vacated its original banking cube. We are now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the cube and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.
Overall for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP, 2.9% [ph] cash. These same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania where, as Steve mentioned, business has been very weak, reflecting the down cycle in the New York Hotel business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.
To conclude my remarks, let me say, we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of these reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years, we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over 1 million square feet of leases in active dialogue.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington."

Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importa",741,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with a few comments on the D.C. market. The Washington D.C. metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly, for our business, 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services, including tech-related and stem sectors. 
Unemployment in the D.C. region has continued downward, is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country. In the second quarter, both Downtown D.C. and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in D.C.  Year-to-date, the numbers are showing slow but steady absorption. 
In residential, the D.C. metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption. Notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop, the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom. 
Let me review our second quarter leasing and occupancy metrics and please note all of these exclude Skyline property. We completed 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-markets were flattish, negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3%, down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. 
Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is 2 GSA tenants who vacated, both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants, 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
And finally, residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%. 
In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June, we opened the Bartlett, our new 699 unit apartment building in Pentagon City. Located directly atop a new 40,000 square feet Whole Foods, this 23-story building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan D.C. area. When surveyed, 67% of our residents reported they selected the Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package, consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, validating our intense focus on the tenant experience.
The market response to the Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renter's moved in on June 2 and through yesterday, we have leased 314 units, that's 45% of the building already. With this philosophy and rents that are higher than we projected, we are very pleased with our performance to-date. 
Meanwhile, in Crystal City, WeWork opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into a WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and is invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this venture.
The Bartlett and WeLive bring our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro served in Georgetown and close in Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned, in July, we received approvals to develop the next phase of the metropolitan park block, a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature [indiscernible]  style architecture coupled with Vornado's signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett, will have commanding views of D.C. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.
Including this new project, we can build almost 5,600 additional apartments in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select teardowns of aging office buildings. 
In Downtown D.C, at the corner of 17th and M streets, we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building, 1700M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right. 
I thank you and I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

Our options are do nothing; leave those various series in place; pay them off, which would then change the complexion of our liquidity a little bit or maybe even more than a little bit; or refinance them at lower rates as perpetual preferred.

So I'll give you an example. I mean, we've been -- we're thrilled with this Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it you ought to make a trip down there and take a look. So it's a -- it's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well-received, I think, done  in the Washington District in years and years and years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a, give or take, a 7 and the value of that building, if you value the marketplace for first class apartment and brand new product, is X. If you divide those 2 numbers, there is a very satisfactory return on that capital. By the way, we built that building free and clear. We didn't use any debt to build that building. So the long and the short of it is, and I think I said in my prepared remarks, that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings. We want to build the next one immediately, the one after that quickly and more and more and more. So we think that, that's a very interesting business. Now we -- and we're excited about it. So we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly, we have the very scarce, very important land holdings in and around the Pentagon City and in Crystal City. So if you don't have the land, you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific, very satisfactory. And we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we are extremely optimistic about development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City. I don't think I was bashful in my opening remarks. Now I look at this all differently. I -- if we do separate -- and by the way, we have sort of -- that's the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that, I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington, call it whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it as if we're just moving from one pocket to the other. It will be well capitalized with enough capital. I'm talking about Washington-co or the SpinCo to complete its development and complete its mission, and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think that our company will do both. If we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its development initiative for sure."

First off, we're very, very happy with where we are -- where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last 3, 4 years to get here. So our debt is very low. When Steve Theriot went through some of the statistics, he just said casually, well, our debt is 25%. Well, 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great. Our liquidity is superb, the best in the business. And so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that, we -- evidenced by our calling a series of preferreds yesterday that, we think, that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. It doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view, but it certainly increases our earnings. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, I said over the last better part of 1.5 years maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high, that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny. And that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing for first-quality assets that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market. There hasn't been a hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date, and the reason is that hotel business, as we've discussed already, is very soft. Obviously, the condo -- well, not obviously, but factually, the condo market is also soft -- not our condo, of course, but other people's condos. That's sort of a joke. But it's really not a joke, it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently -- that first-class properties are currently offered.

We're not in the hope business, we're in the realistic business. And so we believe rents have gotten to the point where they are too high, and retailers are not comfortable paying those rents. So that's step one. The second part of it is our retail portfolio is pretty full -- very full, actually. We completed the last 2 big deals in town: The Victoria's Secret, huge megadeal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch megadeal on Upper Fifth as well. So we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin. So 4 years ago or 5 years ago, there might have been 3 or 4 or more retailers bidding for a particular prime space on a prime street. Right now, there's barely 1 or 2. And they're difficult to close because people -- retailers are concerned. Retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high. We're aware of that, and obviously, we're in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the street are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is the volumes are fine, but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be, I believe, the strongest, in my opinion -- the strongest market in the city. SoHo and Broadway are softish. 34th Street is doing fine.

And each of those sites could handle, ultimately, up to 1,000 apartment units. So I think, we think, that it is -- it makes all good economic sense.

So the oldest buildings are 40 years old, something like that, office buildings. And we have worked with the government powers that be so that in general, we can take down an older building and we build a building, which is 150% the size of that or something like that, okay? So the financial analysis goes like this. Do you take this 40-year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to let it with the understanding that, that capital will have to be amortized over, pick a number, a 10-year lease and at the end of that 10-year lease, that 40 year-old building is now 50 years old. So that's one column of numbers and concept. The second column is you take it down, build a brand new residential building, which will have -- which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just a matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand new first-class residential product is a very, very profitable and good trade. In addition to that, the -- when you get thousands of units in a tight cluster, you get a community and that creates more value. And we know how to create that community and amenitize it and make it so that people will consider this a very, very fine place to live, thinking about where it is, where it's located to, where jobs are, the metro access of it. And by the way, it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall, which is 1 of the top 10 malls in the country, and the Whole Foods, et cetera.

So we've got $1 billion Macy's and Madison Square Garden and we sit on top of the Station. We don't sit 4 blocks away and you have to walk to it in the rain, we sit on top of it. So the basic -- and by the way, the basis that we have in our buildings is you go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary. So you have all that as a backdrop. Now the way we look at it, let's take and cut it into bite-size pieces. So take 1 Penn and 2 Penn, which together are 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published. You know what they are. They -- the first digit is a 5, and we believe that notwithstanding anything else, we can transform those buildings in this marketplace, so that the average starting rent will be higher. I don't want to get into math now, but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's a capital program, and we're going to do that and that's actually the #1 priority of what we're about. And then there's peripheral development. The retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary. And then we've got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have, I think, very intelligently delayed up until now. And so you know where you have it. We do is we take -- we leg into the project piece by piece. Now with respect to the overall amount of capital that we will be committing to this district, it's 8 million, 9 million feet.  It's huge, it's enormous, it all has very large paybacks and the most important part of it is Vornado is a fortress, financially, and has the capital ability to finance all this.

So at 220 Central Park South, which you seem to be especially interested in, we have the best site, we have the best project, we have the best design, et cetera. But as importantly, we bring a 2% cost of capital to that project. We are competing against people up and down the block, in fact, all over the place, that are paying 12% and 15% for money. As you can imagine, it's not a fair fight, okay? In Crystal City and Pentagon City, my thinking is not dissimilar to that. We own great land parcels and so I look upon that right now as being a sub-cost. We have the capital to build and develop, and this is different than office buildings. If you put up 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 square foot big office building and you catch a weak market, the building either stays vacant for year after year after year. By the way, there's dozens of example of that in the Washington region, or you have to take the price down to a number, which marks it a huge loss. Residential development is different than that, and that is if for a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side of the light you sign a long-term lease and you're locked in to that price, good or bad, for a very long time.

As I've said before, the most important metri",1393,"Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.
A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most important metric we look at are employment numbers, in particular, office using jobs. Private sector employment is up about 80,000 jobs for the trailing 12 months and at 3,773,000 jobs is at an all-time high. Office using employment is also up 14,000 jobs year-over-year and had 1,373,000 jobs, again, it is an all-time high. While this rate of growth for office sector jobs is less than the 35,000 average annual increase of the past 6 years since the recovery kicked in, we are still seeing good office job growth later in the cycle, increasing at a bit over 1% per annum. Most of the brokerage guys has reported modestly increasing space availability levels, both for the quarter and the year-to-date of about 50 basis points. No big deal. Asking rents remain at/or near-record levels and leasing activity for the first 9 months at over 27 million square feet is up about 4% from last year and on par with 10-year averages. What we have seen is a shifting of tenant demand away from commoditized buildings, which are not leasing well to new and updated buildings, which are seeing good activity as tenants seek more modern and efficient space. We anticipated this trend early, having completed 6.5 million square feet of high-quality building repositionings in the last 4 years alone. Our fleet is in great shape.
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. As expected, our occupancy at the end of the third quarter fell slightly by 50 basis points to 95.5%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Customs Service vacating nearly 150,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza for a long planned return to the World Trade Center. We have already leased about 50,000 square feet of that space and have a strong pipeline to fill out the remainder.
For the quarter, we leased 335,000 square feet and 40 transactions at average starting rents of $68.11, representing mark-to-market of 7.1% GAAP and 6.2% cash. About 40% of leasing activity was in Penn Plaza. Let me remind you that this reduced level of activity is a reflection of the fact that during the past 3 years: 2013, '14 and '15, we leased the better part of 9 million square feet handling our major future expirations.
A couple of examples. In 11 Penn Plaza, we entered into long-term renewals with AMC Network and Macy's for an aggregate of 975,000 square feet at Two Penn Plaza, we renewed MSG for 325,000 square feet. And when we knew we would have space coming back to us, we completed headquartered leases with Neuberger Berman for over 400,000 square feet in 1290 Sixth Avenue and with Amazon for 470,000 square feet at 7 West 34th Street, all space that was otherwise coming back to us in the 2017, 2018 period of time. We remain basically full and our expirations are modest with just 113,000 square feet of leases expiring for the balance of this year and only 600,000 square feet in all of 2017, but no one tenant representing more than 75,000 square feet. We have a robust pipeline including more than 560,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and another 700,000 square feet in active discussions.
Last month, a joint venture of Vornado and related companies, a national marriage teaming up the largest owners in Penn Plaza and Hudson Yards, was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic McKinley White Design Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan train hall serving Long Island Railroad and Amtrak passengers, which will be constructed by Skanska. As Governor Cuomo described last month, the great -- the train hall will be a grand civic space at 250,000 square feet, larger than the main hall at Grand Central, the train hall will increase the floor space for the commuting public by over 50%. Over 90 feet above the main train passenger level there'll be a grand skylight supported by historic trusses to allow light to stream into the train hall. The Vornado-related joint venture will acquire approximately 850,000 rentable square feet in the building to be developed into creative office space and ancillary train hall retail for an upfront payment of $230 million. The following building adds to our growing portfolio of new office developments on the Westside, including 61 Ninth, 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh and 85 Tenth Avenue. The interior of the original Farley building, a postal facility, was built as a warehouse with great 17-plus foot floor to floor ceiling heights and floor place averaging over 200,000 rentable square feet. It has the same spectacular bones as our 770 Broadway here in New York and theMART in Chicago, both of which have proven to be best-in-class creative space for a creative office class tenants such as Facebook and Google. We are confident that this building also will contribute to the ongoing repositioning of our Penn Plaza portfolio as a hub for high-quality TAMI tenants seeking to locate via the most important transportation hub in New York. Governor Cuomo and his team deserve enormous credit for advancing this important project. We are proud to have been designated and look forward to working with the state and the railroads to deliver the governor's vision of a grand gateway to New York City.
Turning now to our premier street retail portfolio. During the third quarter, we leased 7,500 square feet with strong positive mark-to-market's of 69.2% GAAP and 53.4% cash. Occupancy ticked up 180 basis points to 96.7%. Ed Hogan, who runs our retail leasing machine in New York, would tell you that over the last couple of months, we had seen retail leasing activity increased for the entry of some new tenants into the market and interest from cosmetics tenants, intimate apparel and food retailers.
As Steve mentioned, we invite you to visit our 640 Fifth Avenue property, which has last week, Victoria's Secret opened their 4 levels stunning new 64,000-square-foot flagship store. To enable the Victoria's Secret to complete its spin out and open to the important holiday season, we completely restacked and repositioned the former H&M space in record time working 3 shifts a day and delivering the space to Victoria's Secret in February.
At the adjacent 3,000-square-foot store with 25 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, Nespresso last week opened a pop-up store for the holiday season, and we have a long-term lease out for the space with a tenant, which will open its first flagship retail store in New York.
At theMART in Chicago, same-store numbers for the third quarter were a very strong positive 12.4% GAAP and 5.5% cash. Great tenants continue to be attracted to the innovation-focused space at theMART, and we're proud of the quality of the 2 tenants we added in the third quarter, Catalog and Caterpillar. Adding these household names to an already blue-chip roster continues to reinforce the preeminence of this unique asset. We leased 20,000 square feet of office space, at average starting rents of $47.46, representing mark-to-market's of 58.2% cash. This leases where our occupancy up by 40 basis points to 98.2%.
In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street, we leased 72,000 square feet this quarter, including a 54,000-square-foot renewal lease with McKinsey & Company. With average starting rents of around $90 per square feet, we believe the building is positioned as the premier office building in San Francisco is clear. Our amenity rich redevelopment of the  Concourse level should be completed around year-end, and we're also making very good progress with potential tenants for the former Bank of America banking hall that we call The Queue.
Overall, for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with a same-store increase of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash or an even stronger 6.5% cap and 11.7% cash, excluding The Hotel Pennsylvania, which really tells a true history. The hotel business in New York continues to feel the impact of oversupply in the market on both occupancy and pricing.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Theriot."

Our Fed ratio will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as a result of the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity in the last 2 years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our fed ratio will return to its normal loss level in the mid-80s by the end of 2017.
As David noted, our New York business had a strong quarter with same-store increases of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, it is an even stronger 6.5% GAAP and 11.7% cash.
On to our Washington business. As noted on Page 48 of our Form 10-Q, we reaffirmed our guidance for our New York business for the full year 2016, I'm sorry, Washington -- our Washington business for the full year 2016 . Within that guidance, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance for core operations of flat to up $4 million. The leasing pace at the Bartlett is running at an incredible 60 units per month. Since we opened the rental office in June of this year, we have leased over 65% of the units of this 699 unit project, a big testament to the quality of the development and the competitiveness of the product. We have leased 455 units and the rental office just opened 5 months ago, just incredible. We leased 177,000 square feet of office space in Washington, excluding Skyline, with mark-to-markets of negative 4.8% GAAP and negative 10.3% cash. Quarter and occupancy of the Washington portfolio, excluding Skyline, was 91.1%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter.
Now to capital markets activity in the quarter. We completed a 5-year, $675 million refinancing of theMART at a 2.7% fixed rate. This loan replaces the 5.75% -- $555 million mortgage that was scheduled to mature in December. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6 and 7/8 percent series J preferred shares at par or 400 -- $246.3 million in the aggregate, which will result in savings of $17 million or $0.08 per share per year. We have virtually no remaining consolidated debt maturities in 2016 and our 2017 maturities are $360 million. Our sale segment debt maturities is $33 million for the remainder of 2016 and $89 million for 2017.
Excluding Skyline and the financing for our 220 Central Park South project, which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average weight of 3.81% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years.
Debt-to-enterprise value was 26%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.5x, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys ""R"" Us, debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.4x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash to marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.
I will now turn the call back to Steve."

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin transaction. A few years ago, we response to a chronically undervalued stock price ended admittedly too complex and diffuse collection of assets and businesses. We began a program to simplify and focus the company, all with the objective of daylighting our treasure trove of assets and creating value. As I said at that time, everything was on the table and that we would leave no stone unturned. We have since exited business lines and none core investments gotten out of the mall business, sold-out of the showroom business retaining, of course, the giant 3.7 million square foot Chicago Mart building. We spun off our shopping center business into Urban Edge Properties, all told, this activity totaled $9.1 billion. Of course, along the way, we acquired and developed assets into our core, all the while upgrading the mix and quality of our portfolio.
Last evening, we announced another major milestone. The spinning off of our Washington, D.C. business and simultaneous merger with The JBG Companies and what is known in the trade as a tax-free spin merge transaction or technically, a reverse morse trust. A little history here, we acquired our Washington business in 2002 at the right time in the cycle and at a great price. We have since built through acquisition and development to be the largest owner in the region. In 2011, we suffered a double whammy when the Department of Defense and related contractors begun vacating what would total 2.5 million square feet under the BRAC statue just as the Washington office market was solid. At the nadir, we suffered a $70 million hit to annual income. Even though our flagship New York business powered through and its growth well exceeded the hit from Washington, our stock price has suffered. What to do? For various reasons, selling the Washington business was not an option nor that we want to sell it at the bottom. Some would say that by not selling, we are actually buying and that's sort of true. We do like the Washington market place, and we do like our assets in Washington, especially at that price. So no sell but we did believe the best strategy was to separate Washington and New York for reasons that I will speak about in a minute. The tax-free spin-off was the perfect solution. Spinning our Washington business as is would have been just an okay execution but combining it with the market leader, JBG, would be a blockbuster. At that point, we initiated an approach to JBG and began a courtship.
3 things happened: One, we got to know each other very well; two, the JBG gang began to appreciate that the permanent capital and scale of the public company format maybe an even better business model than their private fund model; and three, I decided at that time not to proceed. I simply couldn't get comfortable with serving 2 masters, their private limited partners and our public shareholders. This time around, we have it exactly correct. There will be no new funds and the existing funds will run off. We all, management, the board and shareholders will all worship at the order of stock price, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
JBG having caught the bug pursued an IPO, pursued a merger with several other already public candidates and finally made a deal with NY RT, which I believe everyone on the call is probably familiar with. Maybe the JBG guys stubbed their toes on the NY RT deal, maybe not, whatever. There were lessons learned there and these guys are very fast learners. But I can assure you that the JBG team are great real estaters and great moneymakers and after all, that's what I'm after. I cannot emphasize enough the capability of the 150 person JBG team. This is the real prize in this deal. Key business terms and important information regarding our JBG SMITH transaction are available in the press release and investor presentation on our website at www.vno.com. A couple of points before Michael takes you through the investor deck. Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the combined company. JBG limited partners are expected to own approximately 20% and JV management is expected to own approximately 6%, all of those percentages being subject to closing adjustments. The combined company will be led by JBG's senior management team. Critically, management's interest will be perfectly aligned with shareholder's interest. They will be huge equity holders of restricted stock and units with appropriate vesting and lock-up periods. Management will certainly be eating its own cooking. We very carefully selected, which JBG assets would be included, always with an eye towards future growth. Valuations would determine fairly and absolutely symmetrically.
JBG's SMITH Board of Trustees will consists of 12 members, a majority of whom will be independent. Vornado and JBG will each designate 6 trustees. I will be Chairman of the Board. Matt Kelly will be Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. We expect to file our Form-10 in December, and we expect to complete the distribution and combination in the second quarter of 2017. Vornado's board has already approved the transaction and JBG's investors have consented. This is a great deal for Vornado. This is a great deal for Vornado and its shareholders. It was very carefully constructed. It is transformative and it accomplishes many of our most important goals. It creates 2 highly focused pure plays each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card, and each of the 2 will be the largest and the leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York or Washington or both as they choose, no bundling here.
The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than 4 times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York's treasured trove of assets and superior financial performance. Importantly, it is the big fix for Washington. JBG SMITH will be the market leading power house with unrivaled portfolio of substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG SMITH has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the country and the math works. At its simplest, pure-play New York, unburdened by Washington, has the trade much better. And Washington with JBG management has to perform and trade much better. I'll say it again. At its simplest, pure New York unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better, and Washington, with JBG management, has to perform and trade much better. Simply stated, that's why this is a great deal.
Now I'll turn it over to Michael who will take you through the investor presentation."

Turning now to the slide deck we posted on our website last night. There's a lot of detail in there. We won't review all of it on this call, but I'm going to take you through the highlights. Starting on Page 1.
I want to start by reiterating that this transaction is a continuation of the strategy Vornado began several years ago to simplify and focus our business. When all is said and done, we would have driven significant shareholder value by creating 3 best-in-class, pure-play, publicly traded REITs. Urban Edge with its growth-oriented focus and portfolio of retail assets and high barrier centers, a Highly focused New York City-centric Vornado with premier office assets and the only publicly investable, high street retail portfolio at significant scale and JBG SMITH, which will be the largest, pure-play and soon-to-be power house Washington, D.C. real estate company.
Page 2 provides an overview of the transaction. Vornado is spinning off its Washington, D.C. business and JBG is merging in its operating company and a portfolio of selected assets. It's a marriage of the 2 largest and most well respected real estate organization from the D.C. market, the product of which will be the market-leading pure-play D.C. real estate company. The combined transaction value is $8.4 billion. Much likely to set up Urban Edge, JBG SMITH will be well-capitalized with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet designed to execute on its business plan. As Steve said earlier, Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74%, JBG's current limited partners, approximately 20% and JBG management, approximately 6%. We'll talk more about how we derived these percentages in a moment.
And as we'll review shortly, we've taken steps to totally align the interest of JBG SMITH management and its shareholders. In addition, while this deal was motivated by strategic considerations about the opportunities in Washington, D.C. there will be significant cost synergies totaling about $35 million before accounting for public company costs from combining complementary portfolios and platforms. Creating an overhead cost structure inline with best-in-class peers. As for Vornado RemainCo, it will be the premier, pure-play New York city real estate company. We expect to be aggregate of Vornado RemainCo and JBG SMITH dividends will be at least equal to Vornado's current dividend. Finally, we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Page 3 shows you the statistics and makeup of the combined portfolio from this transaction. The asset quality and our urban intel concentration of the 79 asset operating portfolio and almost 20 million-square-foot development pipeline will stand head and shareholders above its competitors. The combined portfolio is diversified in terms of property asset classes and also geographies in Metro D.C. region, where we'll have a significant presence in the best submarkets: Downtown D.C, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Reston and the Cessna. JBG Smith will be in an excellent position to drive outsized returns and value overtime with its unmatched portfolio.
Steve covered the strategic rationale for the transaction at the outset so let's move to Page 5. This page provides an overview of the thought and strategy that went into selecting the JBG assets to merge with the Vornado Charles E. Smith portfolio and position the combined company for outsize growth. We strategically selected the best assets from the larger JBG pool of assets to complement the Vornado D.C. portfolio. Our objective was to create a combined portfolio with the unique profile by selecting strategic, high quality assets, both operating and land, with high-growth potential that reinforce key attributes, including: One, critical mass and core and metro serve markets; two, concentrations in complementary submarkets, particularly in mixed-use environments; three, it enhanced diversification; and four, strong value add opportunities. And we deliberately excluded assets that did not fit these objectives such as those in none metro served areas, highly leveraged GSA-leased buildings, near-term sale candidates and hotels, condominiums and townhouses. These assets will be sold as part of the national wind down of legacy JBG funds.
Now let's move to the methodology we used to value the assets to be merged and the resulting ownership levels, which are the subject to Page 6. We vigorously underwrote and reviewed comps on each other's assets to arrive at fair market values for each side. As Steve said, asset pricing was done fairly and symmetrically with the net result being applied with an average cap rate of 5.1% on each side of its operating assets. For the nonoperating assets, including under construction, development and land assets, we used to consist and return on cost on per pound methodology. Finally, to arrive at the value for each management company, we used a combination of valuation approaches, including multiples on present and transactions and DCF analysis. The result is the Vornado's management company's being contributed at $80 million and JBG's companies being contributed at $335 million. A reflection of the fact that JBG generates 4 to 5 times more than third-party fees in Vornado D.C.'s management company. The bottom line is that Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of new company and JBG's management and LPs will own 26%.
Moving on to Page 7. It was critical to us that the transaction ensured total alignment of management interests with those of JBG SMITH shareholders. As Steve mentioned earlier, JBG SMITH will not raise new private investment funds. The JBG legacy funds are fully invested, no longer on acquisition mode and will be wind down. The only thing that matters is the shareholders. Importantly, the vast majority of the management team's network will be tied up in JBG SMITH stock. JBG management own approximately 6% of the combined company, putting it in the top decile of the companies. Of the JBG management company shares, 50% will vest immediately and be locked up for 3 years and 50% will vest over Month's 31 to 60 and be locked up until the end of the fifth year. The management team will not receive promotes on contributed assets but will continue receiving promotes they're entitled to on legacy fund assets as the funds are wound down.
Finally, we are also instituting a $100 million formation equity grant award for a broad group of JBG's Smith employees that is entirely performance-based to align interest deeper into the organization. To be clear, this award only becomes in the money if the stock goes up and is only worth $100 million if the stock doubles.
Let me move on to process and timing on Page 8. We expect to file the Form 10 by the end of this year and complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of customary third-party consents and Hard-Scott Rodino. There's no shareholder vote required on the Vornado side and JBG has already received all their investor approvals for the transaction, so closing is just a matter of time. The pro rata distribution ratio for Vornado shareholders will be 1:2, so investors will receive 1 share of JBG Smith for every 2 shares of Vornado stock they own. Vornado will provide interim support services in areas such as IT, tax and SEC reporting pursuant to a transition services agreement.
Before turning over to Matt, to discuss the prospects for JBG Smith, let's first take a quick look at the post-spin Vornado. Pages 9 through 17 cover Vornado RemainCo, which is really the main event. With the separation of D.C, Vornado RemainCo will be the premier pure-play New York City REIT for the portfolio of irreplaceable, best-in-class office and high street retail assets in one of the best markets in the world and one where we're a clear leader. Upon completion of this transaction, 99% of our EBITDA, will from our core New York real estate segment, including theMART and the 555 California. New York City, who itself account for 88% of our EBITDA after the spin-off, up from 70% today. All in all, it's a world-class business. Having divested non-core assets and now at this latest step, we hope investors will be better able to appreciate what a powerhouse our New York business is. We don't have time to cover every page in this section but the images and financial figures clearly demonstrate what a unique collection of assets we have. One, where we spent years curating and which cannot be replicated. In addition, the figure show the impressive growth our New York business has historically delivered both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. The metrics are industry-leading.
So to sum up, as a New York City focused pure-play with a fortress balance sheet, attractive growth opportunities and a deep and experienced management team with a proven track record, Vornado will be well positioned to further enhance shareholder value.
Now let me turn the floor over to Matt Kelly to walk you through JBG SMITH Properties."

I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll do the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.
For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. market for over 5 decades. We're known for our creative dealmaking and capital allocation scales and for our deep bench of development and value creation expertise across product types. While our D.C. market experience and office, residential and retail is unrivaled, we have been trendsetters in our market by mixing uses and projects that deliver the amenities and features that tenant demand. Concentrating in passive growth locations with metro access and deep retail potential had been key drivers of our success. We've been the most active player in the Washington market, and we are the definition of a local sharpshooter. We know our market block by block and see virtually every opportunity in the market.
Since 2000, we have acquired over 19 million square feet and have developed almost 18 million square feet of cross-sell product types. Our team has worked together for an average of 20 years and our leadership spans multiple generations. We have delivered top tier results for our investors with a leverage ROR of over 23% on $3.7 billion of equity deployed in over 250 investments across 9 discretionary funds. None of our funds have lost money even though that we initiated at the high point of the last cycle.
As shown on Page 20, the JBG team will form the senior-most leadership of this combined company. Most of us have spent our entire careers at JBG and have worked together at managing capital on behalf of some of the best-known university and, and foundations in the world.
Before closing, we will hire a CFO from outside of the company with a focus on public market experience. In addition to the JBG team, Mitchell Schear will join our executive committee, and Jim Creedon, Patrick Tyrrell and Laurie Kramer of Vornado will serve in key EVP positions in the new company. As we combined the operating teams of both companies, we will be focused on efficiency, minimizing risks and combining the best from 2 great teams. The Washington Post rated JBG as the #1 ranked large company to work for in our market across all industries and we intend for JBG SMITH to continue in that tradition of first class management and execution. Our team will have strong alignment with investors. We will own roughly 6% of the new company and our investment will represent the vast majority of the net worth of this team.
Let's move to Page 21 and talk about the combined company and why we're so excited about this opportunity. JBG SMITH will be the largest player in our market with some of the business existing assets and a market-leading development pipeline. We will be a powerhouse of a company with unmatched scale and access to growth opportunities. Our proven track record of delivering on mixed-use value creation and infill locations could not be a better match for an opportunity like Crystal City. What many have seen as a challenged office portfolio in a tough market, we see as an opportunity to pick off low-hanging fruit and position Crystal City as a vibrant amenity-rich destination within Washington. Combine this with the best-in-class balance sheet and the momentum of recovery in our market and we couldn't be more excited to get to work executing our vision for this new company.
Before I move on to the highlights of the company and the portfolio, a word about process. What I cover today will be high level. Prior to launch, we will follow-up with a deep dive roadshow to give investors much more granular information and an opportunity to meet us face-to-face. As you can see on Page 22, including assets under construction and near term starts, JBG SMITH will own 14 million square feet of commercial space and almost 6,000 apartment units making us the market-leading player in Washington with some of the best assets in the market.
On Page 23, you'll see that combining our portfolios comes with minimal overlap and creates an ownership profile concentrated in the complementary collection of the most sought after submarkets in the area. Over 98% of the portfolio is within half a mile of the planned or existing metro station. These assets, existing construction and future development have taken years in some cases, well over a decade to assemble, entitle, design and execute. No other player in our market has access to a growth pipeline like this. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of execution, we believe we can turn that into strong income growth and value creation.
Before we talk about future opportunities, I'll spend a minute on the existing portfolio and development assets that have recently delivered or commenced construction, which is summarized on Page 24. The combined portfolio has free rent burn off and signed but not yet commenced leases totaling 590,000 square feet of occupancy. The combined company has 5 recently delivered apartment buildings totaling over 1,400 units at our share with average occupancy of 72% as of September 30. All 5 are on top of or next to a brand-new or planned grocery store and many have additional adjacent small stores. All are metro served and benefit from a rich base of amenities.
As you can see on Page 25, we have 4 trophy quality assets currently under construction totaling over 820,000 square feet. 3 of these are commercial assets, including CEB Tower in Rosslyn and retail projects adjacent to Reston town center and the Fester Road. These assets are 63% preleased with most of the balance of the lease-up consisting of 8 of the top 10 floors of CEB Tower, arguably the best building in the submarket with unobstructive views of the D.C. Mall and monumental core.
The fourth asset is a trophy apartment building facing the main entrance to National's park that will sit amidst the new retail heavy entertainment district between the stadium and the Navy Yard metro station. All of these projects are fully capitalized.
Pages 26 and 27 cover our development pipeline, which includes a range of projects in various states of readiness for construction. Our near-term pipeline consists of 7 projects, of which 5 are mixed-use and 2 are standalone CBD trophy office buildings. By value and scale, roughly half our office and the balance, multifamily and retail. All of these projects are entitled, designed and substantially ready to commence construction. We expect that most, if not all of the retail apartment projects will proceed in the short term. Based on current office market conditions, our bias is to patiently pursue pre-leases before going vertical, and we are currently following that strategy with the office asset listed here. We also intend to capitalize this company in a manner that will enable us to pursue all of these projects while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.
On Page 27, we've laid out a summary of the balance of the future development pipeline of this company. At over 17 million square feet, this is the largest treasure trove of growth opportunities you'll find in any company in our market. This pipeline will enable us to double the size of this company through assets entirely under our control today. I want to be clear on something here. We will not be levering this company to go hog-wild on development We may be new to the public markets, but we are not new to capital allocation and the avoidance of risk. I'll cover that a little more when we talked about the balance sheet but first I want to address Crystal City specifically.
Crystal City is one of the most compelling opportunities in this company's portfolio. Its challenges were tailor-made for our toolkit of deep development expertise, retail experience and our placemaking-driven approach. It has everything going for it, including metro, critical mass, proximity to key demand drivers, views and great access not to mention, a jurisdiction with great schools and low taxes but it lacks a critical mass of amenities. It's existing amenities are compromised, underground retail with not enough anchor space and it lacks sufficient residential density to be a vibrant 24-hour place. It's fix for these deficiencies is exactly the sort of thing we're best to creating and it's the skill set we've perfected throughout our 55-year history. When we've done this elsewhere, as it's taken us years to assemble the critical math to change the neighborhood. With Crystal City, the concentrated ownership is there Day 1. All that it requires is the right plan and sufficient time to implement it. We talked a lot about place making and changing neighborhoods and to some, it sounds like renovating dozens of assets and spending billions of dollars. That's not what we're talking about and that is not what Crystal City needs. Any great neighborhood needs a well-executed retail heart.
What we've done on Page 28 is to overlay the size of all of Crystal City on 3 of the most vibrant districts in our market, one of which we primarily created to show Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest D.C.. As you can see here, and zoomed in on Page 29, the heart of these neighborhoods is typically a very -- is typically very small, just a few blocks. This heart has multiple anchors, plenty of services, banks, dry cleaners et cetera, but it also has a carefully curated mix of amenity retail. Local shops, maker shops, streetscape, parking green space et cetera. It also has enough residential to be a place where its visiting after work hours. It's truly special we'll have 1 or more destination anchors often entertainment-based. The point is that repositioning of large concentration of asset like Crystal City did not require the renovation of the entire place. To the contrary, it only requires the right execution of a relatively small subset of the neighborhood requiring far less capital. Done right, that well-planned heart can drive outside occupancy and rent growth in all of the neighboring uses.
The age of building stock, on Page 28, is included to demonstrate that while all of these submarkets have older building stock in Crystal City, they've all rented a premium because they are great and monetized vibrant places. That's the missing ingredient. We'll have much more detail on our plans for Crystal City down the road, but I want to repeat that it is one of the elements of this new company that we're most excited about.
Now let's talk about capitalization on Page 30. We intend to launch this company with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet with deep capacity to fund future growth without over leveraging the company. In addition to a very manageable debt maturity profile, we will have an appropriately sized credit facility for access to immediate capital and flexibility but our debt financing strategy will not rely on corporate debt. Long-term financing will be done on a nonrecourse basis at the asset level. We will also be aggressive about identifying opportunities to recycle within the portfolio by selling our joint venturing selected assets whose market value exceeds replacement costs and deploying that capital into newer higher growth, internal investments and potential acquisitions.
Finally, on Page 31, a word about our market. Washington's office market has had a rough run for almost a decade. In the office market, our average 5-year net absorption was negative 250,000 square feet versus a 20-year average of positive 3.3 million square feet. Although many private sector players rightsized after sequestration and BRAC, the wreckage in the office market has taken a long time to recover. With much of that tenant rightsizing behind us, and most recently, our best job growth year in a decade, we believe that Washington is poised to grow in the coming years where much of the rest of the country has began to flatten out or even softened. This counter cyclicality is not atypical for our market. We further believe that growth will be concentrated in the places that offer what tenants and consumers want, vibrant retail, services, amenities, walkability and transit.
On the apartment side having the highest median household income in the country and a lower rent share of wallet than other Gateway cities supports much of the strong apartment absorption we've seen in spite of high levels of supply. When for-sale housing is added to the mix, our total housing units had actually been in line with demand. So this outcome has not been surprising. All of these translated to conclude that Washington has a healthy base, from which to grow in the coming years, especially in infill submarkets that offer what tenants demand. As I said before, we look forward to meeting with investors prior to launch to provide a deep dive review of the portfolio and our strategy. We're very excited about this opportunity and we believe this powerhouse of the company will be an incredible platform to deliver strong shareholder value over time.
Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap up."

Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursue -- we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG in its current state, has been a bit of somewhere in the mid-40s that after all expenses and what-have-you. That's what's come to the bottom line of the current JBG. We are -- our advisers and our exploration into the comps is that these companies and trade for between 9x and 10x. So If you take the midpoint on that, that means, let's say, call it, $45 million of EBITDA coming out of a JBG would be worth somewhere $400 million, maybe a little bit higher. And the reason may be a little bit higher is because of that premier company and its marketplace and it would probably sell for a premium. So if the JBG Partners were to sell this company in it's current incarnation, as a going concern, as the market by of that is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million, that's one.  Number 2, that's approximately the number or in a range of what we were talking about when we engaged with JBG a couple of years ago, and that's even less than the number that the -- was negotiated in the famous or infamous NYRT transaction. So I would have to say that. So our number was $335 million. That's not in cash. That is in script. And so the value of that, that was -- what happens is beginning as a percentage of the company and shares and those shares will fluctuate so if they fluctuate down and when we fluctuate, whatever. Now we also valued our management company at $80 million. I can tell you that our management company has 0 EBITDA. So the way we looked at it, we paid -- the Vornado shareholder paid a net $335 million less $80 million or $255 million for the JBG platform, the whole shooting match. The team, all their employees and what-have-you. Now I've already talked about what the going concern value of JBG was. Let's talk about what the value would be to us. Well, to us, the net was for $255 million. And we've already said that we're going to run off -- we're not going to do anymore funds, and we're going to run off of the assets that are excluded. Those assets that are excluded have a free string, which is pretty substantial and the discount value of that is somewhere between $175 million, maybe even up to $200 million, depending upon the discount rate you used. So now we get that our $335 million goes down to $255 million because of the value of our management company and then goes down to -- let's use a number of $175 million, $180 million, so it goes down to $60 million, $70 million is the net cost of this whole platform to us. But that's not the end of the story. By combining the JBG platform and the Vornado existing platform, there are synergies. Those synergies are, we believe, growth $35-ish million, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. And then that doesn't -- you have to deduct from that the cost of being a separate public company, which we're guesstimating at, call it, somewhere between $12 million, $15 million. So maybe, Michael, is telling he think it's less -- so maybe we think the net synergies of combining the 2 companies are pick a number $20 million to $25 million, less than it would be, okay. Well, that has a value and that is very favorable compared to the net $60 million, $70 million price buying this platform. So that's the math, which is you can tell, I think, from a fairly detailed? Was very carefully analyzed and thought about. Now let's go to the last point. Would you rather own the company with the JBG combined, that would be worth less, let's say, $50 million as a quarter of Vornado shares, 25 shares, would you rather have the combined company with it assets, it's opportunities of the future and the leading management platform in the marketplace and even if we push you a quarter of $0.30 to do that and the answer is, of course, it would, okay. So I think, Steve, that's a long-winded answer to your question."

So we have, first of all, this big, really big. Second of all, it's in the best submarkets in depth. The third thing is that this is an opportunity to create new buildings at outsize returns, which are substantially better than you could buy a similar building in a similar location on a return basis, which means that there is a profit to a big property in this land as you develop it over time. Now there's a trend going on in the world today. A, new buildings are much more valuable than old buildings. B, there's obsolescence in real estate so that when you're building a new building, you can make a state-of-the-art what the customer wants, whether it's an office building or a residential building. And 3, the capital, maintenance capital for a new building is like almost 0 for the first 10 years or so as opposed to an older building.

If you think about some of the challenges that REITs have gone through recently we are you either had companies with large scale development but really did or every year it's and select leases are going to come but not we have to wait in the following year, have you sort of think about managing the Street's expectations for earnings growth or NAV growth?

And we understand the importance of avoiding surprises. We understand the importance of frankly not overpromising. And as you said at the very beginning of your question, we are going to be very prudent as to what we've developed and when we develop it but when you talk about existing assets and their performance, you really can't talk about that separate and in distant from the development because a lot of what they do and in particular, if you look at Crystal City, a lot of what we will do is predicated on improving that as a place.

But what's been included here is basically a concentration on 2 nodes but in the greater Reston submarket. One is of the side of the Wheeling Avenue metro stop, and that's a mixed-use project, retail heavy, grocery anchored, lots of apartment, right in the strike zone of what we do. And then the one you just described, which is the summit office buildings in Reston Town Center, West RTT West, to some of you may recognize, that was a former Reston executive the center, which we actually acquired from Vornado. That is not only an existing office building, but you'll see in the presentation, it is also one of the new development projects. That is an asset where we are delivering retail. It is within on Page 25, it's about 40,000 square feet of ground floors, small store retail, that is designed to a monetizable's buildings. That asset fits right in between Boston properties, Reston Town Center and the exit platform to the new under construction metro station. And so it is right in the footpath connecting those 2 and that retail, we believe, will be phenomenally successful. It has already been successful in enabling us to lease that building. This is against a backdrop of Northern Virginia suburban office. It's enabled us to lease that building with the retail only roughly half preleased and not yet delivered. So lease of that building fully and that rent that exceed where they were when we acquired it by 20%. That's against the backdrop of the market that has been flat and that has as you heard me articulate earlier, had negative net absorption.

So I'll go back, and I'll tell you, back in 1990, as we looked at office sector jobs, one out of every 2 of the sector job at the time was financial services-related. As we look at the city today, that number today is less than 1 out of every 3, so a lot of those has been published about the lack of growth in financial services.

I also just to reemphasize what I said and that is we are a mature recovery. We have seen office sector job come down from the peak that we saw over the 2011 to basically '14, '15 period of time. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still seeing very good office sector job growth somewhere around 14,000, 15,000 jobs, which translates into about 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of absorption. So continue entrance, I will tell you, we are continuing to see a pretty good growth."

I don't have an exact percentage for you as to what's ready to go on the $17 million right now that we try to articulate that in the near-term development pipeline. All of that is ready to go. There is a large proportion of the $17 million that is matter of right, which is to say that it is consistent with underlying zoning. But in many of the jurisdictions in Washington, in order to be able to pull a building permit, you have to do a lot of work and get something closer to the start line. Some of those assets are. Some of them are not. We will go through in detail in buckets of those things so that investors will have a lot of transparency as to what's in that. On your first question about how we will capitalize at debt, we intend to be stingy with the equity of this company. And only when we are trading at what we think are very attractive values, ideally premiums to net asset value, will issuing equity even be considered a possibility for us. When it comes to flexibility and how we finance things, there are a number of assets in this portfolio that if we believe we can recycle within the portfolio by selling assets, it's values has dramatically exceed replacement costs, we will do that. And deploy that capital into net new value creation opportunities, in particular when the deals on costs are high, and when we look at deals on costs, we don't look at yield and cost from the standpoint of incremental cost only. We look at yields on customer the standpoint of what is our land actually worth and what is the yield on cost for the new project inclusive of that land value. Because if that doesn't pencil, then it points more toward simply saline your segment. And that's a well traveled path for us as well as the when it comes to capital sources, I felt about project level leverage, and in the recourse asset level financing, we also have leverage of our third-party capital business, a ton of relationships that we have cultivated over decades of prospective joint venture partners. Many of them will be much happier that we are in a permanent capital structure than in a finite life vehicle. Because many of the best partners out there want a partner who would hang around with them potentially forever the best the plan and not have an artificial eye with that exit post imposed upon them the virtue of a fund life. Those partners are folks that can be selectively resources and capital providers oftentimes when the REIT market or not the most efficient source of capital to fund new opportunities. We will have to weigh that against how much of an asset we want to own, how much of the big we want to own in a project versus how much do we want to share with an investment partner and frankly, are we getting enough out of the deal with that partner to where it doing that. But that analysis is one that is really forms a bedrock of how and when we have decided to do everything that we've done throughout our history and that will be changing in this new construct."

With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most import",1393,"Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.
A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most important metric we look at are employment numbers, in particular, office using jobs. Private sector employment is up about 80,000 jobs for the trailing 12 months and at 3,773,000 jobs is at an all-time high. Office using employment is also up 14,000 jobs year-over-year and had 1,373,000 jobs, again, it is an all-time high. While this rate of growth for office sector jobs is less than the 35,000 average annual increase over the past 6 years since the recovery kicked in, we are still seeing good office job growth later in the cycle, increasing at a bit over 1% per annum. Most of the brokerage houses have reported modestly increasing space availability levels, both for the quarter and the year-to-date of about 50 basis points. No big deal. Asking rents remain at/or near-record levels and leasing activity for the first 9 months at over 27 million square feet is up about 4% from last year and on par with 10-year averages. What we have seen is a shifting of tenant demand away from commoditized buildings, which are not leasing well to new and updated buildings, which are seeing good activity as tenants seek more modern and efficient space. We anticipated this trend early, having completed 6.5 million square feet of high-quality building repositionings in the last 4 years alone. Our fleet is in great shape.
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. As expected, our occupancy at the end of the third quarter fell slightly by 50 basis points to 95.5%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Customs Service vacating nearly 150,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza for a long planned return to the World Trade Center. We have already leased about 50,000 square feet of that space and have a strong pipeline to fill out the remainder.
For the quarter, we leased 335,000 square feet and 40 transactions at average starting rents of $68.11, representing mark-to-market of 7.1% GAAP and 6.2% cash. About 40% of leasing activity was in Penn Plaza. Let me remind you that this reduced level of activity is a reflection of the fact that during the past 3 years: 2013, '14 and '15, we leased the better part of 9 million square feet handling our major future expirations.
A couple of examples. In 11 Penn Plaza, we entered into long-term renewals with AMC Network and Macy's for an aggregate of 975,000 square feet. At Two Penn Plaza, we renewed MSG for 325,000 square feet. And where we knew we would have space coming back to us, we completed headquarter leases with Neuberger Berman for over 400,000 square feet in 1290 Sixth Avenue and with Amazon for 470,000 square feet at 7 West 34th Street, all space that was otherwise coming back to us in the 2017, 2018 period of time. We remain basically full and our expirations are modest with just 113,000 square feet of leases expiring for the balance of this year and only 600,000 square feet in all of 2017, with no one tenant representing more than 75,000 square feet. We have a robust pipeline including more than 560,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and another 700,000 square feet in active discussions.
Last month, a joint venture of Vornado and the related companies, a natural marriage teaming up the largest owners in Penn Plaza and Hudson Yards, was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic McKinley White Design Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan train hall serving Long Island Railroad and Amtrak passengers, which will be constructed by Skanska. As Governor Cuomo described last month, the great -- the train hall will be a grand civic space at 250,000 square feet, larger than the main hall at Grand Central, the train hall will increase the floor space for the commuting public by over 50%. Over 90 feet above the main train passenger level there'll be a grand skylight supported by historic trusses to allow light to stream into the train hall. The Vornado-related joint venture will acquire approximately 850,000 rentable square feet in the building to be developed into creative office space and ancillary train hall retail for an upfront payment of $230 million. The Farley building adds to our growing portfolio of new office developments on the Westside, including 61 Ninth, 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh and 85 Tenth Avenue. The interior of the original Farley building, a postal facility, was built as a warehouse with great 17-plus foot floor-to-floor ceiling heights and floor place averaging over 200,000 rentable square feet. It has the same spectacular bones as our 770 Broadway here in New York and theMART in Chicago, both of which have proven to be best-in-class creative space for a creative office class tenants such as Facebook and Google. We are confident that this building also will contribute to the ongoing repositioning of our Penn Plaza portfolio as a hub for high-quality TAMI tenants seeking to locate via the most important transportation hub in New York. Governor Cuomo and his team deserve enormous credit for advancing this important project. We are proud to have been designated and look forward to working with the state and the railroads to deliver the governor's vision of a grand gateway to New York City.
Turning now to our premier street retail portfolio. During the third quarter, we leased 7,500 square feet with strong positive mark-to-market's of 69.2% GAAP and 53.4% cash. Occupancy ticked up 180 basis points to 96.7%. Ed Hogan, who runs our retail leasing machine in New York, would tell you that over the last couple of months, we have seen retail leasing activity increase with the entry of some new tenants into the market and interest from cosmetics tenants, intimate apparel and food retailers.
As Steve mentioned, we invite you to visit our 640 Fifth Avenue property, where just last week, Victoria's Secret opened their 4 levels stunning new 64,000-square-foot flagship store. To enable to Victoria's Secret to complete its fit out and open for the important holiday season, we completely restacked and repositioned the former H&M space in record time working 3 shifts a day and delivering the space to Victoria's Secret in February.
At the adjacent 3,000-square-foot store with 25 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, Nespresso last week opened a pop-up store for the holiday season, and we have a long-term lease out for the space with a tenant, which will open its first flagship retail store in New York.
At theMART in Chicago, same-store numbers for the third quarter were a very strong positive 12.4% GAAP and 5.5% cash. Great tenants continue to be attracted to the innovation-focused space at theMART, and we're proud of the quality of the 2 tenants we added in the third quarter, Kellogg and Caterpillar. Adding these household names to an already blue-chip roster continues to reinforce the preeminence of this unique asset. We leased 20,000 square feet of office space, at average starting rents of $47.46, representing mark-to-market's of 58.2% cash. This leases brought our occupancy up by 40 basis points to 98.2%.
In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street, we leased 72,000 square feet this quarter, including a 54,000-square-foot renewal lease with McKinsey & Company. With average starting rents of around $90 per square feet, we believe the building is positioned as the premier office building in San Francisco is clear. Our amenity-rich redevelopment of the  concourse level should be completed around year-end, and we're also making very good progress with potential tenants for the former Bank of America banking hall that we call the cube.
Overall, for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with a same-store increase of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash or an even stronger 6.5% cap and 11.7% cash, excluding The Hotel Pennsylvania, which really tells a truer history. The hotel business in New York continues to feel the impact of oversupply in the market on both occupancy and pricing.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Theriot."

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136",689,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136.2 million or $0.72 per share. After adjusting for net gains and other items that affect comparability in both periods, adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter is $0.39 or $0.02 above the prior year's third quarter.
FFO, as adjusted, which we formerly called comparable FFO, was $1.24 per share for the third quarter or $0.03 above the prior year's third quarter. See Page 39 of our Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of FFO and FFO as adjusted.
Our Fed ratio exceeded 100% in the first and second quarters and is 95.5% for the third quarter. Our Fed ratio will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as a result of the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity in the last 2 years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our fed ratio will return to its normal loss level in the mid-80s by the end of 2017.
As David noted, our New York business had a strong quarter with same-store increases of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, it is an even stronger 6.5% GAAP and 11.7% cash.
On to our Washington business. As noted on Page 48 of our Form 10-Q, we reaffirmed our guidance for our New York business for the full year 2016, I'm sorry, Washington -- our Washington business for the full year 2016. Within that guidance, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance for core operations of flat to up $4 million. The leasing pace at the Bartlett is running at an incredible 60 units per month. Since we opened the rental office in June of this year, we have leased over 65% of the units of this 699 unit project, a big testament to the quality of the development and the competitiveness of the product. We have leased 455 units and the rental office just opened 5 months ago, just incredible. We leased 177,000 square feet of office space in Washington, excluding Skyline, with mark-to-markets of negative 4.8% GAAP and negative 10.3% cash. Quarter end occupancy of the Washington portfolio, excluding Skyline, was 91.1%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter.
Now to capital markets activity in the quarter. We completed a 5-year, $675 million refinancing of theMART at a 2.7% fixed rate. This loan replaces the 5.75% $555 million mortgage that was scheduled to mature in December. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% series J preferred shares at par or 400 -- $246.3 million in the aggregate, which will result in savings of $17 million or $0.08 per share per year. We have virtually no remaining consolidated debt maturities in 2016 and our 2017 maturities are $360 million. Our share of partially owned entities debt maturities is $33 million for the remainder of 2016 and $89 million for 2017.
Excluding Skyline and the financing for our 220 Central Park South project, which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.81% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years.
Debt-to-enterprise value was 26%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.5x, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys ""R"" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.4x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.
I will now turn the call back to Steve."

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction.

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction. A few years ago, in response to a chronically undervalued stock price and under admittedly too complex and diffuse collection of assets and businesses we began a program to simplify and focus the company, all with an objective of daylighting our treasure trove of assets and creating value. As I said at that time, everything was on the table and that we would leave no stone unturned. We have since exited business lines and none core investments, gotten out of the mall business, sold-out of the showroom business retaining, of course, the giant 3.7 million square foot Chicago Mart building. We spun off our shopping center business into Urban Edge Properties, all told, this activity totaled $9.1 billion. Of course, along the way, we acquired and developed assets into our core, all the while upgrading the mix and quality of our portfolio.
Last evening, we announced another major milestone. The spinning off of our Washington, D.C. business and simultaneous merger with The JBG Companies and what is known in the trade as a tax-free spin merge transaction or technically, a  Reverse Morris Trust. A little history here, we acquired our Washington business in 2002 at the right time in the cycle and at a great price. We have since built it through acquisition and development to be the largest owner in the region. In 2011, we suffered a double whammy when the Department of Defense and related contractors began vacating what would total 2.5 million square feet under the BRAC statue just as the Washington office market was softening. At the nadir, we suffered a $70 million hit to annual income. Even though our flagship New York business powered through and its growth well exceeded the hit from Washington, our stock price has suffered. What to do? For various reasons, selling the Washington business was not an option nor that we want to sell it at the bottom. Some would say that by not selling, we are actually buying and that's sort of true. We do like the Washington market place, and we do like our assets in Washington, especially at that price. So no sell but we did believe the best strategy was to separate Washington and New York for reasons that I will speak about in a minute. The tax-free spin-off was the perfect solution. Spinning our Washington business as is would have been just an okay execution but combining it with the market leader, JBG, would be a blockbuster. At that point, we initiated an approach to JBG and began a courtship.
3 things happened: One, we got to know each other very well; two, the JBG gang began to appreciate that the permanent capital and scale of the public company format maybe an even better business model than their private fund model; and three, I decided at that time not to proceed. I simply couldn't get comfortable with serving 2 masters, their private limited partners and our public shareholders. This time around, we have it exactly correct. There will be no new funds and the existing funds will run off. We all, management, the board and shareholders will all worship at the alter of stock price, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
JBG having caught the bug pursued an IPO, pursued a merger with several other already public candidates and finally made a deal with NYRT, which I believe everyone on the call is probably familiar with. Maybe the JBG guys stubbed their toes on the NYRT deal, maybe not, whatever. There were lessons learned there and these guys are very fast learners. But I can assure you that the JBG team are great real estaters and great moneymakers and after all, that's what I'm after. I cannot emphasize enough the capability of the 150 person JBG team. This is the real prize in this deal. Key business terms and important information regarding our JBG SMITH transaction are available in the press release and investor presentation on our website at www.vno.com. A couple of points before Michael takes you through the investor deck. Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the combined company. JBG limited partners are expected to own approximately 20% and JV management is expected to own approximately 6%, all of those percentages being subject to closing adjustments. The combined company will be led by JBG's senior management team. Critically, management's interest will be perfectly aligned with shareholder's interest. They will be huge equity holders of restricted stock and units with appropriate vesting and lock-up periods. Management will certainly be eating its own cooking. We very carefully selected, which JBG assets would be included, always with an eye towards future growth. Valuations were determined fairly and absolutely symmetrically.
JBG's SMITH Board of Trustees will consists of 12 members, a majority of whom will be independent. Vornado and JBG will each designate 6 trustees. I will be Chairman of the Board. Matt Kelly will be Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. We expect to file our Form-10 in December, and we expect to complete the distribution and combination in the second quarter of 2017. Vornado's board has already approved the transaction and JBG's investors have consented. This is a great deal for Vornado. This is a great deal for Vornado and its shareholders. It was very carefully constructed. It is transformative and it accomplishes many of our most important goals. It creates 2 highly focused pure plays each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card, and each of the 2 will be the largest and the leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York or Washington or both as they choose, no bundling here.
The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than 4 times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York's treasured trove of assets and superior financial performance. Importantly, it is the big fix for Washington. JBG SMITH will be the market leading power house with unrivaled portfolio of substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG SMITH has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the country and the math works. At its simplest, pure-play New York, unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better. And Washington with JBG management has to perform and trade much better. I'll say it again. At its simplest, pure New York unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better, and Washington, with JBG management, has to perform and trade much better. Simply stated, that's why this is a great deal.
Now I'll turn it over to Michael who will take you through the investor presentation."

Turning now to the slide deck we posted on our website last night. There's a lot of detail in there. We won't review all of it on this call, but I'm going to take you through the highlights. Starting on Page 1.
I want to start by reiterating that this transaction is a continuation of the strategy Vornado began several years ago to simplify and focus our business. When all is said and done, we will have driven significant shareholder value by creating 3 best-in-class, pure-play, publicly traded REITs. Urban Edge with its growth-oriented focus and portfolio of retail assets and high barrier centers, a highly focused New York City-centric Vornado with premier office assets and the only publicly investable, high street retail portfolio of significant scale and JBG SMITH, which will be the largest, pure-play and soon-to-be power house Washington, D.C. real estate company.
Page 2 provides an overview of the transaction. Vornado is spinning off its Washington, D.C. business and JBG is merging in its operating company and a portfolio of selected assets. It's a marriage of the 2 largest and most well respected real estate organization from the D.C. market, the product of which will be the market-leading pure-play D.C. real estate company. The combined transaction value is $8.4 billion. Much likely to set up Urban Edge, JBG SMITH will be well-capitalized with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet designed to execute on its business plan. As Steve said earlier, Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74%, JBG's current limited partners, approximately 20% and JBG management, approximately 6%. We'll talk more about how we derived these percentages in a moment.
And as we'll review shortly, we've taken steps to totally align the interest of JBG SMITH management and its shareholders. In addition, while this deal was motivated by strategic considerations about the opportunities in Washington, D.C. there will be significant cost synergies totaling about $35 million before accounting for public company costs from combining complementary portfolios and platforms. Creating an overhead cost structure inline with best-in-class peers. As for Vornado RemainCo, it will be the premier, pure-play New York city real estate company. We expect to be aggregate of Vornado RemainCo and JBG SMITH dividends will be at least equal to Vornado's current dividend. Finally, we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Page 3 shows you the statistics and makeup of the combined portfolio from this transaction. The asset quality and our urban intel concentration of the 79 asset operating portfolio and almost 20 million-square-foot development pipeline will stand head and shoulders above its competitors. The combined portfolio is diversified in terms of property asset classes and also geographies in the Metro D.C. region, where we'll have a significant presence in the best submarkets: Downtown D.C, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Reston and Bethesda. JBG SMITH will be in an excellent position to drive outsized returns and value overtime with its unmatched portfolio.
Steve covered the strategic rationale for the transaction at the outset, so let's move to Page 5. This page provides an overview of the thought and strategy that went into selecting the JBG assets to merge with the Vornado Charles E. Smith portfolio and position the combined company for outsized growth. We strategically selected the best assets from the larger JBG pool of assets to complement the Vornado D.C. portfolio. Our objective was to create a combined portfolio with the unique profile by selecting strategic, high quality assets, both operating and land, with high-growth potential that reinforce key attributes, including: One, critical mass in core and metro serve markets; two, concentrations in complementary submarkets, particularly in mixed-use environments; three, it enhanced diversification; and four, strong value add opportunities. And we deliberately excluded assets that did not fit these objectives such as those in nonmetro served areas, highly leveraged GSA-leased buildings, near-term sale candidates and hotels, condominiums and townhouses. These assets will be sold as part of the natural wind down of legacy JBG funds.
Now let's move to the methodology we used to value the assets to be merged and the resulting ownership levels, which are the subject of Page 6. We vigorously underwrote and reviewed comps on each other's assets to arrive at fair market values for each side. As Steve said, asset pricing was done fairly and symmetrically with the net result being an implied weighted average cap rate of 5.1% on each sides operating assets. For the nonoperating assets, including under construction, development and land assets, we used a consistent return on cost and per pound methodology. Finally, to arrive at a value for each management company, we used a combination of valuation approaches, including multiples on precedent transactions and DCF analysis. The result is that Vornado's management company is being contributed at $80 million and JBG's companies being contributed at $335 million. A reflection of the fact that JBG generates 4 to 5 times more in third-party fees than Vornado D.C.'s management company. The bottom line is that Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the new company and JBG's management and LPs will own 26%.
Moving on to Page 7. It was critical to us that the transaction ensured total alignment of management interest with those of JBG SMITH shareholders. As Steve mentioned earlier, JBG SMITH will not raise new private investment funds. The JBG legacy funds are fully invested, no longer in acquisition mode and will be wind down. The only thing that matters is the shareholders. Importantly, the vast majority of the management team's network will be tied up in JBG SMITH stock. JBG management own approximately 6% of the combined company, putting it in the top decile of the companies. Of the JBG management company shares, 50% will vest immediately and be locked up for 3 years and 50% will vest over month's 31 to 60 and be locked up until the end of the fifth year. The management team will not receive promotes on contributed assets but will continue receiving promotes they're entitled to on legacy fund assets as the funds are wind down.
Finally, we are also instituting a $100 million formation equity grant award for a broad group of JBG's SMITH employees that is entirely performance-based to align interest deeper into the organization. To be clear, this award only becomes in the money if the stock goes up and is only worth $100 million if the stock doubles.
Let me move on to process and timing on Page 8. We expect to file the Form 10 by the end of this year, we'll complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of customary third-party consents and Hart–Scott–Rodino. There's no shareholder vote required on the Vornado side and JBG has already received all their investor approvals for the transaction, so closing is just a matter of time. The pro rata distribution ratio for Vornado shareholders will be 1:2, so investors will receive 1 share of JBG SMITH for every 2 shares of Vornado stock they own. Vornado will provide interim support services in areas such as IT, tax and SEC reporting pursuant to a transition services agreement.
Before turning over it to Matt, to discuss the prospects for JBG SMITH, let's first take a quick look at the post-spin Vornado. Pages 9 through 17 cover Vornado RemainCo, which is really the main event. With the separation of D.C, Vornado RemainCo will be the premier pure-play New York City REIT with a portfolio of irreplaceable, best-in-class office and high street retail assets in one of the best markets in the world and one where we're a clear leader. Upon completion of this transaction, 99% of our EBITDA, will come from our core New York real estate segment, including theMART and the 555 California. New York City, will itself account for 88% of our EBITDA after the spin-off, up from 70% today. All-in-all, it's a world-class business. Having divested non-core assets and now with this latest step, we hope investors will be better able to appreciate what a powerhouse our New York business is. We don't have time to cover every page in this section but the images and financial figures clearly demonstrate what a unique collection of assets we have, one we've spent years curating and which cannot be replicated. In addition, the figure show the impressive growth our New York business has historically delivered both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. The metrics are industry-leading.
So to sum up, as a New York City focused pure-play with a fortress balance sheet, attractive growth opportunities and a deep and experienced management team with a proven track record, Vornado will be well positioned to further enhance shareholder value.
Now let me turn the floor over to Matt Kelly to walk you through JBG SMITH Properties."

I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. m",2204,"Thanks, Michael and Steve, and thanks to you, all, for joining the call. I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.
For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. market for over 5 decades. We're known for our creative dealmaking and capital allocation skills and for our deep bench of development and value creation expertise across product types. While our D.C. market experience and office, residential and retail is unrivaled, we have been trendsetters in our market by mixing uses and projects that deliver the amenities and features that tenants demand. Concentrating in passive growth locations with metro access and deep retail potential have been key drivers of our success. We've been the most active player in the Washington market, and we are the definition of a local sharpshooter. We know our market block by block and see virtually every opportunity in the market.
Since 2000, we have acquired over 19 million square feet and have developed almost 18 million square feet of cross-sell product types. Our team has worked together for an average of 20 years and our leadership spans multiple generations. We have delivered top tier results for our investors with a leverage ROR of over 23% on $3.7 billion of equity deployed in over 250 investments across 9 discretionary funds. None of our funds have lost money even those that we initiated at the high point of the last cycle.
As shown on Page 20, the JBG team will form the senior-most leadership of this combined company. Most of us have spent our entire careers at JBG and have worked together managing capital on behalf of some of the best-known university endowments and foundations in the world.
Before closing, we will hire a CFO from outside the company with a focus on public market experience. In addition to the JBG team, Mitchell Schear will join our executive committee, and Jim Creedon, Patrick Tyrrell and Laurie Kramer of Vornado will serve in key EVP positions in the new company. As we combine the operating teams of both companies, we will be focused on efficiency, minimizing risk and combining the best from 2 great teams. The Washington Post rated JBG the #1 ranked large company to work for in our market across all industries and we intend for JBG SMITH to continue in that tradition of first class management and execution. Our team will have strong alignment with investors. We will own roughly 6% of the new company and our investment will represent the vast majority of the net worth of this team.
Let's move to Page 21 and talk about the combined company and why we're so excited about this opportunity. JBG SMITH will be the largest player in our market with some of the best existing assets and a market-leading development pipeline. We will be a powerhouse of a company with unmatched scale and access to growth opportunities. Our proven track record of delivering on mixed-use value creation and infill locations could not be a better match for an opportunity like Crystal City. What many have seen as a challenged office portfolio in a tough market, we see as an opportunity to pick off low-hanging fruit and position Crystal City as a vibrant amenity-rich destination within Washington. Combine this with the best-in-class balance sheet and the momentum of recovery in our market and we couldn't be more excited to get to work executing our vision for this new company.
Before I move on to the highlights of the company and the portfolio, a word about process. What I cover today will be high level. Prior to launch, we will follow-up with a deep dive roadshow to give investors much more granular information and an opportunity to meet us face-to-face. As you can see on Page 22, including assets under construction and near term starts, JBG SMITH will own 14 million square feet of commercial space and almost 6,000 apartment units making us the market-leading player in Washington with some of the best assets in the market.
On Page 23, you'll see that combining our portfolios comes with minimal overlap and creates an ownership profile concentrated in the complementary collection of the most sought after submarkets in the area. Over 98% of the portfolio is within half a mile of the planned or existing metro station. These assets, existing construction and future development have taken years in some cases, well over a decade to assemble, entitle, design and execute. No other player in our market has access to a growth pipeline like this. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of execution, we believe we can turn that into strong income growth and value creation.
Before we talk about future opportunities, I'll spend a minute on the existing portfolio and development assets that have recently delivered or commenced construction, which is summarized on Page 24. The combined portfolio has free rent burn-off and signed but not yet commenced leases totaling 590,000 square feet of occupancy. The combined company has 5 recently delivered apartment buildings totaling over 1,400 units at our share with average occupancy of 72% as of September 30. All 5 are on top of or next to a brand-new or planned grocery store and many have additional adjacent small stores. All are metro served and benefit from a rich base of amenities.
As you can see on Page 25, we have 4 trophy quality assets currently under construction totaling over 820,000 square feet. 3 of these are commercial assets, including CEB Tower in Rosslyn and retail projects adjacent to Reston Town Center and the Fester Road. These assets are 63% preleased with most of the balance of the lease-up consisting of 8 of the top 10 floors of CEB Tower, arguably the best building in the submarket with unobstructive views of the D.C. Mall and monumental core.
The fourth asset is a trophy apartment building facing the main entrance to National's Park that will sit amidst a new retail heavy entertainment district between the stadium and the Navy Yard Metro Station. All of these projects are fully capitalized.
Pages 26 and 27 cover our development pipeline, which includes a range of projects in various states of readiness for construction. Our near-term pipeline consists of 7 projects, of which 5 are mixed-use and 2 are standalone CBD trophy office buildings. By value and scale, roughly half our office and the balance, multifamily and retail. All of these projects are entitled, designed and substantially ready to commence construction. We expect that most, if not all of the retail and apartment projects will proceed in the short term. Based on current office market conditions, our bias is to patiently pursue pre-leases before going vertical, and we are currently following that strategy with the office asset listed here. We also intend to capitalize this company in a manner that will enable us to pursue all of these projects while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.
On Page 27, we've laid out a summary of the balance of the future development pipeline of this company. At over 17 million square feet, this is the largest treasure trove of growth opportunities you'll find in any company in our market. This pipeline will enable us to double the size of this company through assets entirely under our control today. I want to be clear on something here. We will not be levering this company to go hog-wild on development. We may be new to the public markets, but we are not new to capital allocation and the avoidance of risk. I'll cover that a little more when we talk about the balance sheet but first I want to address Crystal City specifically.
Crystal City is one of the most compelling opportunities in this company's portfolio. Its challenges were tailor-made for our toolkit of deep development expertise, retail experience and our placemaking-driven approach. It has everything going for it, including metro, critical mass, proximity to key demand drivers, views and great access not to mention, a jurisdiction with great schools and low taxes but it lacks a critical mass of amenities. It's existing amenities are compromised, underground retail with not enough anchor space and it lacks sufficient residential density to be a vibrant 24-hour place. The fix for these deficiencies is exactly the sort of thing we're best at creating and it's the skill set we've perfected throughout our 55-year history. When we've done this elsewhere, it has taken us years to assemble the critical mass to change a neighborhood. With Crystal City, the concentrated ownership is there Day 1. All that it requires is the right plan and sufficient time to implement it. We talked a lot about placemaking and changing neighborhoods and to some, this sounds like renovating dozens of assets and spending billions of dollars. That's not what we're talking about and that is not what Crystal City needs. Any great neighborhood needs a well-executed retail heart.
What we've done on Page 28 is to overlay the size of all of Crystal City on 3 of the most vibrant high-rent districts in our market, one of which we primarily created the Shaw Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest D.C. As you can see here, and zoomed in on Page 29, the heart of these neighborhoods is typically a very -- is typically very small, just a few blocks. This heart has multiple anchors, plenty of services, banks, dry cleaners et cetera, but it also has a carefully curated mix of amenity retail. Local shops, maker shops, streetscape, parking, green space et cetera. It also has enough residential to be a place worth visiting after work hours. If it's truly special it will have 1 or more destination anchors often entertainment-based. The point is that repositioning a large concentration of asset like Crystal City does not require the renovation of the entire place. To the contrary, it only requires the right execution of a relatively small subset of the neighborhood requiring far less capital. Done right, that well-planned heart can drive outside occupancy and rent growth in all of the neighboring uses.
The age of building stock, on Page 28, is included to demonstrate that while all of these submarkets have older building stock than Crystal City, they all rent at a premium because they are great amnestied vibrant places. That's the missing ingredient. We'll have much more detail on our plans for Crystal City down the road, but I want to repeat that it is one of the elements of this new company that we're most excited about.
Now let's talk about capitalization on Page 30. We intend to launch this company with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet with deep capacity to fund future growth without over leveraging the company. In addition to a very manageable debt maturity profile, we will have an appropriately sized credit facility for access to immediate capital and flexibility but our debt financing strategy will not rely on corporate debt. Long-term financing will be done on a nonrecourse basis at the asset level. We will also be aggressive about identifying opportunities to recycle within the portfolio by selling our joint venturing selected assets whose market value exceeds replacement costs and deploying that capital into newer higher growth, internal investments and potential acquisitions.
Finally, on Page 31, a word about our market. Washington's office market has had a rough run for almost a decade. In the office market, our average 5-year net absorption was negative 250,000 square feet versus a 20-year average of positive 3.3 million square feet. Although many private sector players rightsized after sequestration and BRAC, the wreckage in the office market has taken a long time to recover. With much of that tenant rightsizing behind us, and most recently, our best job growth year in a decade, we believe that Washington is poised to grow in the coming years where much of the rest of the country has began to flatten out or even soften. This counter cyclicality is not atypical for our market. We further believe that growth will be concentrated in the places that offer what tenants and consumers want, vibrant retail, services, amenities, walkability and transit.
On the apartment side having the highest median household income in the country and a lower rent share of wallet than other Gateway cities supports much of the strong apartment absorption we've seen in spite of high levels of supply. When for-sale housing is added to the mix, our total housing units have actually been in line with demand. So this outcome has not been surprising. All of these translate us to conclude that Washington has a healthy base, from which to grow in the coming years, especially in infill submarkets that offer what tenants demand. As I said before, we look forward to meeting with investors prior to launch to provide a deep dive review of the portfolio and our strategy. We're very excited about this opportunity and we believe this powerhouse of the company will be an incredible platform to deliver strong shareholder value over time.
Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap up."

So interestingly, when we spun off Urban Edge, which probably would -- when it's inside, buried inside Vornado, it trades at a discount; outside of Vornado, it sells -- it trades at a premium because the assets and the management are worth it.

So as it gets isolated and as it becomes its own company and as it [indiscernible], we expect investors to appraise it and give it a price which is, dare I say, better than the price that we think it's awarded buried in Vornado.

First of all, it was done very carefully. Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was.

Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG, in its current state, has a EBITDA somewhere in the mid-40s. That's after all expenses or what have you. That's what's come to the bottom line of the current JBG. We are -- our advisers and our exploration into the comps is, is that these companies and trade for between 9x and 10x. So If you take a midpoint on that, that means the, let's say, call it, $45 million of EBITDA coming out of a JBG would be worth somewhere, $400 million, maybe a little bit higher. And the reason maybe a little bit higher is because it's the premier company in its marketplace, and it would probably sell for a premium. So if the JBG partners were to sell this company in it's current incarnation, as the going concern, and we think market value by of that is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million, step one. Step two is, that's approximately the number or in a range of what we were talking about when we engaged with JBG a couple of years ago, and that's even less than the number that the -- was negotiated in the famous or infamous NYRT transaction. So I would have [ph], say that. So our number was $335 million. That's not in cash. That is in script. And so the value of that, that was -- and what happens is they are going to be getting a percentage of the company in shares, and those shares will fluctuate. So if they fluctuate down, that's where they fluctuate and whatever. Now we also valued our management company at $80 million. I can tell you that our management company has 0 EBITDA. So the way we looked at it, we paid a -- the Vornado shareholder paid a net $335 million less $80 million or $255 million for the JBG platform, the whole shooting match: The team, all their employees and what have you. Now I've already talked about what the going concern value of JBG was. Let's talk about what the value would be to us. Well, to us, the net was for $255 million. And we've already said that we're going to run off -- we're not going to do any more funds, and we're going to run off of the assets that were excluded. Those assets that are excluded have a fee stream which is pretty substantial, and the discounted value of that is somewhere between $175 million, maybe even up to $200 million, depending upon the discount rate you use. So now we get that our $335 million goes down to $255 million because of the value of our management company and then goes down to -- let's use a number of $175 million, $180 million. So it goes down to $60 million, $70 million is the net cost of this whole platform to us. But that's not the end of the story. By combining the JBG platform and the Vornado existing platform, there are synergies. Those synergies are, we believe, gross $35-ish million, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. And then that doesn't -- if you have to deduct from that the cost of being a separate public company, which we're guesstimating at, call it, somewhere between $12 million, $15 million. So maybe -- Michael is telling he thinks it's less. But let's say -- so maybe we think the net synergies of combining the 2 companies are, pick a number, $20 million to $25 million less than it would be, okay? Well, that has a value and is very favorable compared to the net $60 million, $70 million price of buying this platform. So that's the math, which is you can tell, I think from Mike fairly detailed remarks, was very carefully analyzed and thought about. Now let's go to the last point. Would you rather own the company with JBG combined, that would be worth less, let's say, $50 million is a $0.25 of Vornado share, $0.25. Would you rather have the combined company with it assets, it's opportunities of the future and the leading management platform in the marketplace, even if it cost you a $0.25 of $0.30 to do that? And the answer is, of course you would, okay? So I think, Steve, that's a long-winded answer to your question."

Second of all, it's in the best submarkets in depth. The third thing is, is that this is an opportunity to create new buildings at outsized returns, which are substantially better than you could buy a similar building in a similar location on a return basis, which means that there is a profit to a big profit in this land as you develop it over time. Now there's a trend going on in the world today. A, new buildings are much more valuable than old buildings. B, there's obsolescence in real estate. So that when you're building a new building, you can make it state of the art, what the customer wants, whether it's an office building or a residential building. And three, the capital, maintenance capital for a new building is like almost 0 for the first 10 years or so as opposed to an older building.

As far as reporting and everything you just described, well, yes, we have been private. We have not been a private sole proprietor with a single investor the way I think a lot of our developer competitors in the market are structured. We have hundreds of investors. We have 9 funds. We do regular quarterly reporting. We are very transparent. We spend a lot of time with our investors. We communicate in a copious fashion. And that's not going to change. We will be supplementing the team with folks who have deep public market expertise in the areas that you described because it's critical that we get that right. And we will. The first part of your question with respect to flexibility, I think there is a misperception that somehow, you can't be nimble if you're in the public markets or that you can't take advantage of opportunities, perhaps, in the same way you might do in private markets. I just don't buy that. I think good real estate decisions are good real estate decisions, whether you're public or private. And I think one of the things of that we have demonstrated in our history, as we have moved from being a syndicator to a fund manager to a fund manager with lots of the joint venture relationships and other things, that in fact, no matter what your capital structure and your legal structure and your ownership structure is, you can still attack and pursue aggressively the best real estate decisions and take advantage of the best opportunities in the market. And that's exactly what we intend to do because that is a big part of our success, and that's not going to be changing, even though our structure will be."

If you think about some of the challenges that REITs have gone through recently, where you've either had companies with large-scale developments that's diluted earnings; or every year, it seems like leases are going to come, but now we have to wait till the following year, how do you sort of think about managing The Street's expectations for earnings growth or NAV growth?

I think as it relates to that, the market is the market. Where we are invested, we believe, in -- this company is in the best places within that market: The submarkets that will outperform and have consistently outperformed. As it relates to managing expectations, we have historically always made an effort to under promise and over deliver. And we understand the importance of avoiding surprises. We understand the importance of, frankly, not overpromising. And as you said at the very beginning of your question, we are going to be very prudent as to what we develop and when we develop it. But when you talk about existing assets and their performance, you really can't talk about that separate and distinct from new developments because a lot of what we do, and in particular if you look at Crystal City, a lot of what we will do is predicated on improving that as a place. And delivering new and different uses to Crystal City, retail and residential in particular, that will turn it into a different place that we believe will actually have as big an impact with respect to the value and the income potential of those new deliveries, as it will on the existing inventory of office supply in that submarket."

The reality is that, that is the by-product of all the work product. And we had a downtown portfolio that's better than JBG's and it's a lower cap rate than that; and Crystal City is more capital-intensive, it's higher. So it just so happened, coincidentally, that's where it came out. And I really mean that. We have a buildup of what your assets go in. Obviously, we'd spent a lot of time crafting which assets we pulled in because we want this company built for success, but it's somewhat coincidental that they end up with the same number. The methodology was consistent in terms of district-to-district and submarket-to-submarket, and it just so happened to end up there. I think we probably have a little more capital intensity on our assets, given Crystal City, than JBG does. And so therefore, they probably have a bit more embedded growth on the other assets. But look, I think the bottom line is you're dealing with 2 parties that are highly sophisticated, that are tough negotiators. We've both been successful for our investors investing.

But what's been included here is basically a concentration on 2 nodes within the greater Reston submarket. One is the -- at the site of the Wheelie Avenue Metro stop. And that's a mixed-use project, retail-heavy, grocery-anchored, lots of apartments, right in the strike zone of what we do. And then the one you just described, which is the Summit office buildings in Reston Town Center West, RTC West, which some of you may recognize. That was a former Reston Executive Center, which we actually acquired from Vornado. That is not only an existing office building, but you'll see in the presentation, it is also one of the new development projects. That is an asset where we are delivering retail, the RTC West retail on Page 25, it's about 40,000 square feet of ground-floor, small-store retail that is designed to amenitize those buildings. That asset sits right in between Boston properties, Reston Town Center and the exit platform to the new under construction Metro station. And so it is right in the footpath connecting those 2, and that retail, we believe, will be phenomenally successful. It has already been successful in enabling us to lease that building. This is against a backdrop of Northern Virginia suburban office. It's enabled us to lease that building with the retail only roughly half preleased and not yet delivered, to lease of that building fully and at rents that exceed where they were when we acquired it by 20%. That's against the backdrop of a market that has been flat and that has, as you heard me articulate earlier, had negative net absorption. And so that is a micro case study of the power of amenities and the power of retail. And that's even before the Metro has shown up."

In fact, above trends from last year. And on average, basically, with kind of 10-year trends. In terms of rents, we have continued to see rents remain stable. I think some of our competitors have said, and I'll echo it, that we've seen moderately increasing concessions. Some of that relates to, in fact, construction cost, so the cost of building space has escalated significantly. So with that, some of the TI packages, in fact, have increased. And then I think most importantly, what I would emphasize is that what we're seeing in New York is a continuing of very, very good diversification of trends in terms of the nature of [indiscernible]. So I'll go back and I'll tell you, back in 1990, as we looked at office sector jobs, 1 out of every 2 office sector jobs at the time was financial services-related. As we look at the city today, that number today is less than 1 out of every 3. So although there's been a lot published about the lack of growth in financial services, in fact, to some extent, a continuing slight loss in financial services jobs, the reality is, as you look at the overall health of the city and the diversification of job growth, I think it's as good as we've ever seen. I also will just reemphasize what I said, and that is we are in a mature recovery. We had seen office sector job come down from the peak that we saw over the 2011 to basically '14, '15 period of time. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still seeing very good office sector job growth, somewhere around 14,000, 15,000 jobs, which translates into about 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of absorption. So continuing trends, I will tell you we are continuing to see pretty good growth."

I don't have an exact percentage for you as to what's ready to go on the $17 million right now that we've tried to articulate that in the near-term development pipeline. All of that is ready to go. There is a large proportion of the $17 million that is matter of right, which is to say that it is consistent with underlying zoning. But in many of the jurisdictions in Washington, in order to be able to pull a building permit, you have to do a lot of work and get something closer to the start line. Some of those assets are, some of them are not. We will go through in detail and bucket those things so that investors will have a lot of transparency as to what's in that. On your first question about how we will capitalize assets, we intend to be stingy with the equity of this company. And only when we are trading at what we think are very attractive values, ideally premiums to net asset value, will issuing equity even be considered a possibility for us. When it comes to flexibility and how we finance things, there are a number of assets in this portfolio, that, if we believe we can recycle within the portfolio by selling assets at values that dramatically exceed replacement costs, we will do that and deploy that capital into net new value creation opportunities, in particular where the yields on costs are high. And when we look at yields on costs, we don't look at yield on cost from the standpoint of incremental cost only. We look at yields on costs from the standpoint of what is our land actually worth and what is the yield on cost for the new project inclusive of that land value. Because if that doesn't pencil, then it points more toward simply selling your land. And that's a well-trodden path for us as well as the thought process. When it comes to capital sources, I've talked about project-level leverage, nonrecourse asset-level financing. We also have, by virtue of our third-party capital business, a ton of relationships that we have cultivated over decades of prospective joint venture partners. Many of them will be much happier that we are in a permanent capital structure than in a finite life vehicle. Because many of the best partners out there want a partner who will hang around with them potentially forever if that's the plan and not have an artificial arbitrary exit date imposed upon them by virtue of a fund life. Those partners are folks that can be selectively resources and capital providers, often at times when the REIT markets are not the most efficient source of capital, to fund new opportunities. We will have to weigh that against how much of an asset we want to own, how much of the VIG [ph] do we want to own in a project versus how much do we want to share with an investment partner. And frankly, are we getting enough out of the deal with that partner to warrant doing that. But that analysis is one that is -- really forms a bedrock of how and when we have decided to do everything that we've done throughout our history. And that won't be changing in this new construct."

Before we begin, I'd like you all to know that our mega 64,000-square-foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue opened a few days ago. I invite everyone to go take a look. It is an amazing retail emporium and the newest jewel in our high street retail crown.

As I've said before, the most import",1393,"Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.
A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most important metric we look at are employment numbers, in particular, office using jobs. Private sector employment is up about 80,000 jobs for the trailing 12 months and at 3,773,000 jobs is at an all-time high. Office using employment is also up 14,000 jobs year-over-year and had 1,373,000 jobs, again, it is an all-time high. While this rate of growth for office sector jobs is less than the 35,000 average annual increase over the past 6 years since the recovery kicked in, we are still seeing good office job growth later in the cycle, increasing at a bit over 1% per annum. Most of the brokerage houses have reported modestly increasing space availability levels, both for the quarter and the year-to-date of about 50 basis points. No big deal. Asking rents remain at/or near-record levels and leasing activity for the first 9 months at over 27 million square feet is up about 4% from last year and on par with 10-year averages. What we have seen is a shifting of tenant demand away from commoditized buildings, which are not leasing well to new and updated buildings, which are seeing good activity as tenants seek more modern and efficient space. We anticipated this trend early, having completed 6.5 million square feet of high-quality building repositionings in the last 4 years alone. Our fleet is in great shape.
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. As expected, our occupancy at the end of the third quarter fell slightly by 50 basis points to 95.5%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Customs Service vacating nearly 150,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza for a long planned return to the World Trade Center. We have already leased about 50,000 square feet of that space and have a strong pipeline to fill out the remainder.
For the quarter, we leased 335,000 square feet and 40 transactions at average starting rents of $68.11, representing mark-to-market of 7.1% GAAP and 6.2% cash. About 40% of leasing activity was in Penn Plaza. Let me remind you that this reduced level of activity is a reflection of the fact that during the past 3 years: 2013, '14 and '15, we leased the better part of 9 million square feet handling our major future expirations.
A couple of examples. In 11 Penn Plaza, we entered into long-term renewals with AMC Network and Macy's for an aggregate of 975,000 square feet. At Two Penn Plaza, we renewed MSG for 325,000 square feet. And where we knew we would have space coming back to us, we completed headquarter leases with Neuberger Berman for over 400,000 square feet in 1290 Sixth Avenue and with Amazon for 470,000 square feet at 7 West 34th Street, all space that was otherwise coming back to us in the 2017, 2018 period of time. We remain basically full and our expirations are modest with just 113,000 square feet of leases expiring for the balance of this year and only 600,000 square feet in all of 2017, with no one tenant representing more than 75,000 square feet. We have a robust pipeline including more than 560,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and another 700,000 square feet in active discussions.
Last month, a joint venture of Vornado and the related companies, a natural marriage teaming up the largest owners in Penn Plaza and Hudson Yards, was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic McKinley White Design Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan train hall serving Long Island Railroad and Amtrak passengers, which will be constructed by Skanska. As Governor Cuomo described last month, the great -- the train hall will be a grand civic space at 250,000 square feet, larger than the main hall at Grand Central, the train hall will increase the floor space for the commuting public by over 50%. Over 90 feet above the main train passenger level there'll be a grand skylight supported by historic trusses to allow light to stream into the train hall. The Vornado-related joint venture will acquire approximately 850,000 rentable square feet in the building to be developed into creative office space and ancillary train hall retail for an upfront payment of $230 million. The Farley building adds to our growing portfolio of new office developments on the Westside, including 61 Ninth, 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh and 85 Tenth Avenue. The interior of the original Farley building, a postal facility, was built as a warehouse with great 17-plus foot floor-to-floor ceiling heights and floor place averaging over 200,000 rentable square feet. It has the same spectacular bones as our 770 Broadway here in New York and theMART in Chicago, both of which have proven to be best-in-class creative space for a creative office class tenants such as Facebook and Google. We are confident that this building also will contribute to the ongoing repositioning of our Penn Plaza portfolio as a hub for high-quality TAMI tenants seeking to locate via the most important transportation hub in New York. Governor Cuomo and his team deserve enormous credit for advancing this important project. We are proud to have been designated and look forward to working with the state and the railroads to deliver the governor's vision of a grand gateway to New York City.
Turning now to our premier street retail portfolio. During the third quarter, we leased 7,500 square feet with strong positive mark-to-market's of 69.2% GAAP and 53.4% cash. Occupancy ticked up 180 basis points to 96.7%. Ed Hogan, who runs our retail leasing machine in New York, would tell you that over the last couple of months, we have seen retail leasing activity increase with the entry of some new tenants into the market and interest from cosmetics tenants, intimate apparel and food retailers.
As Steve mentioned, we invite you to visit our 640 Fifth Avenue property, where just last week, Victoria's Secret opened their 4 levels stunning new 64,000-square-foot flagship store. To enable to Victoria's Secret to complete its fit out and open for the important holiday season, we completely restacked and repositioned the former H&M space in record time working 3 shifts a day and delivering the space to Victoria's Secret in February.
At the adjacent 3,000-square-foot store with 25 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, Nespresso last week opened a pop-up store for the holiday season, and we have a long-term lease out for the space with a tenant, which will open its first flagship retail store in New York.
At theMART in Chicago, same-store numbers for the third quarter were a very strong positive 12.4% GAAP and 5.5% cash. Great tenants continue to be attracted to the innovation-focused space at theMART, and we're proud of the quality of the 2 tenants we added in the third quarter, Kellogg and Caterpillar. Adding these household names to an already blue-chip roster continues to reinforce the preeminence of this unique asset. We leased 20,000 square feet of office space, at average starting rents of $47.46, representing mark-to-market's of 58.2% cash. This leases brought our occupancy up by 40 basis points to 98.2%.
In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street, we leased 72,000 square feet this quarter, including a 54,000-square-foot renewal lease with McKinsey & Company. With average starting rents of around $90 per square feet, we believe the building is positioned as the premier office building in San Francisco is clear. Our amenity-rich redevelopment of the  concourse level should be completed around year-end, and we're also making very good progress with potential tenants for the former Bank of America banking hall that we call the cube.
Overall, for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with a same-store increase of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash or an even stronger 6.5% cap and 11.7% cash, excluding The Hotel Pennsylvania, which really tells a truer history. The hotel business in New York continues to feel the impact of oversupply in the market on both occupancy and pricing.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Theriot."

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136",689,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136.2 million or $0.72 per share. After adjusting for net gains and other items that affect comparability in both periods, adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter is $0.39 or $0.02 above the prior year's third quarter.
FFO, as adjusted, which we formerly called comparable FFO, was $1.24 per share for the third quarter or $0.03 above the prior year's third quarter. See Page 39 of our Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of FFO and FFO as adjusted.
Our Fed ratio exceeded 100% in the first and second quarters and is 95.5% for the third quarter. Our Fed ratio will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as a result of the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity in the last 2 years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our fed ratio will return to its normal loss level in the mid-80s by the end of 2017.
As David noted, our New York business had a strong quarter with same-store increases of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, it is an even stronger 6.5% GAAP and 11.7% cash.
On to our Washington business. As noted on Page 48 of our Form 10-Q, we reaffirmed our guidance for our New York business for the full year 2016, I'm sorry, Washington -- our Washington business for the full year 2016. Within that guidance, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance for core operations of flat to up $4 million. The leasing pace at the Bartlett is running at an incredible 60 units per month. Since we opened the rental office in June of this year, we have leased over 65% of the units of this 699 unit project, a big testament to the quality of the development and the competitiveness of the product. We have leased 455 units and the rental office just opened 5 months ago, just incredible. We leased 177,000 square feet of office space in Washington, excluding Skyline, with mark-to-markets of negative 4.8% GAAP and negative 10.3% cash. Quarter end occupancy of the Washington portfolio, excluding Skyline, was 91.1%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter.
Now to capital markets activity in the quarter. We completed a 5-year, $675 million refinancing of theMART at a 2.7% fixed rate. This loan replaces the 5.75% $555 million mortgage that was scheduled to mature in December. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% series J preferred shares at par or 400 -- $246.3 million in the aggregate, which will result in savings of $17 million or $0.08 per share per year. We have virtually no remaining consolidated debt maturities in 2016 and our 2017 maturities are $360 million. Our share of partially owned entities debt maturities is $33 million for the remainder of 2016 and $89 million for 2017.
Excluding Skyline and the financing for our 220 Central Park South project, which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.81% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years.
Debt-to-enterprise value was 26%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.5x, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys ""R"" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.4x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.
I will now turn the call back to Steve."

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction.

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction. A few years ago, in response to a chronically undervalued stock price and under admittedly too complex and diffuse collection of assets and businesses we began a program to simplify and focus the company, all with an objective of daylighting our treasure trove of assets and creating value. As I said at that time, everything was on the table and that we would leave no stone unturned. We have since exited business lines and none core investments, gotten out of the mall business, sold-out of the showroom business retaining, of course, the giant 3.7 million square foot Chicago Mart building. We spun off our shopping center business into Urban Edge Properties, all told, this activity totaled $9.1 billion. Of course, along the way, we acquired and developed assets into our core, all the while upgrading the mix and quality of our portfolio.
Last evening, we announced another major milestone. The spinning off of our Washington, D.C. business and simultaneous merger with The JBG Companies and what is known in the trade as a tax-free spin merge transaction or technically, a  Reverse Morris Trust. A little history here, we acquired our Washington business in 2002 at the right time in the cycle and at a great price. We have since built it through acquisition and development to be the largest owner in the region. In 2011, we suffered a double whammy when the Department of Defense and related contractors began vacating what would total 2.5 million square feet under the BRAC statue just as the Washington office market was softening. At the nadir, we suffered a $70 million hit to annual income. Even though our flagship New York business powered through and its growth well exceeded the hit from Washington, our stock price has suffered. What to do? For various reasons, selling the Washington business was not an option nor that we want to sell it at the bottom. Some would say that by not selling, we are actually buying and that's sort of true. We do like the Washington market place, and we do like our assets in Washington, especially at that price. So no sell but we did believe the best strategy was to separate Washington and New York for reasons that I will speak about in a minute. The tax-free spin-off was the perfect solution. Spinning our Washington business as is would have been just an okay execution but combining it with the market leader, JBG, would be a blockbuster. At that point, we initiated an approach to JBG and began a courtship.
3 things happened: One, we got to know each other very well; two, the JBG gang began to appreciate that the permanent capital and scale of the public company format maybe an even better business model than their private fund model; and three, I decided at that time not to proceed. I simply couldn't get comfortable with serving 2 masters, their private limited partners and our public shareholders. This time around, we have it exactly correct. There will be no new funds and the existing funds will run off. We all, management, the board and shareholders will all worship at the alter of stock price, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
JBG having caught the bug pursued an IPO, pursued a merger with several other already public candidates and finally made a deal with NYRT, which I believe everyone on the call is probably familiar with. Maybe the JBG guys stubbed their toes on the NYRT deal, maybe not, whatever. There were lessons learned there and these guys are very fast learners. But I can assure you that the JBG team are great real estaters and great moneymakers and after all, that's what I'm after. I cannot emphasize enough the capability of the 150 person JBG team. This is the real prize in this deal. Key business terms and important information regarding our JBG SMITH transaction are available in the press release and investor presentation on our website at www.vno.com. A couple of points before Michael takes you through the investor deck. Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the combined company. JBG limited partners are expected to own approximately 20% and JV management is expected to own approximately 6%, all of those percentages being subject to closing adjustments. The combined company will be led by JBG's senior management team. Critically, management's interest will be perfectly aligned with shareholder's interest. They will be huge equity holders of restricted stock and units with appropriate vesting and lock-up periods. Management will certainly be eating its own cooking. We very carefully selected, which JBG assets would be included, always with an eye towards future growth. Valuations were determined fairly and absolutely symmetrically.
JBG's SMITH Board of Trustees will consists of 12 members, a majority of whom will be independent. Vornado and JBG will each designate 6 trustees. I will be Chairman of the Board. Matt Kelly will be Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. We expect to file our Form-10 in December, and we expect to complete the distribution and combination in the second quarter of 2017. Vornado's board has already approved the transaction and JBG's investors have consented. This is a great deal for Vornado. This is a great deal for Vornado and its shareholders. It was very carefully constructed. It is transformative and it accomplishes many of our most important goals. It creates 2 highly focused pure plays each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card, and each of the 2 will be the largest and the leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York or Washington or both as they choose, no bundling here.
The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than 4 times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York's treasured trove of assets and superior financial performance. Importantly, it is the big fix for Washington. JBG SMITH will be the market leading power house with unrivaled portfolio of substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG SMITH has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the country and the math works. At its simplest, pure-play New York, unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better. And Washington with JBG management has to perform and trade much better. I'll say it again. At its simplest, pure New York unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better, and Washington, with JBG management, has to perform and trade much better. Simply stated, that's why this is a great deal.
Now I'll turn it over to Michael who will take you through the investor presentation."

Turning now to the slide deck we posted on our website last night. There's a lot of detail in there. We won't review all of it on this call, but I'm going to take you through the highlights. Starting on Page 1.
I want to start by reiterating that this transaction is a continuation of the strategy Vornado began several years ago to simplify and focus our business. When all is said and done, we will have driven significant shareholder value by creating 3 best-in-class, pure-play, publicly traded REITs. Urban Edge with its growth-oriented focus and portfolio of retail assets and high barrier centers, a highly focused New York City-centric Vornado with premier office assets and the only publicly investable, high street retail portfolio of significant scale and JBG SMITH, which will be the largest, pure-play and soon-to-be power house Washington, D.C. real estate company.
Page 2 provides an overview of the transaction. Vornado is spinning off its Washington, D.C. business and JBG is merging in its operating company and a portfolio of selected assets. It's a marriage of the 2 largest and most well respected real estate organization from the D.C. market, the product of which will be the market-leading pure-play D.C. real estate company. The combined transaction value is $8.4 billion. Much likely to set up Urban Edge, JBG SMITH will be well-capitalized with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet designed to execute on its business plan. As Steve said earlier, Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74%, JBG's current limited partners, approximately 20% and JBG management, approximately 6%. We'll talk more about how we derived these percentages in a moment.
And as we'll review shortly, we've taken steps to totally align the interest of JBG SMITH management and its shareholders. In addition, while this deal was motivated by strategic considerations about the opportunities in Washington, D.C. there will be significant cost synergies totaling about $35 million before accounting for public company costs from combining complementary portfolios and platforms. Creating an overhead cost structure inline with best-in-class peers. As for Vornado RemainCo, it will be the premier, pure-play New York city real estate company. We expect to be aggregate of Vornado RemainCo and JBG SMITH dividends will be at least equal to Vornado's current dividend. Finally, we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Page 3 shows you the statistics and makeup of the combined portfolio from this transaction. The asset quality and our urban intel concentration of the 79 asset operating portfolio and almost 20 million-square-foot development pipeline will stand head and shoulders above its competitors. The combined portfolio is diversified in terms of property asset classes and also geographies in the Metro D.C. region, where we'll have a significant presence in the best submarkets: Downtown D.C, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Reston and Bethesda. JBG SMITH will be in an excellent position to drive outsized returns and value overtime with its unmatched portfolio.
Steve covered the strategic rationale for the transaction at the outset, so let's move to Page 5. This page provides an overview of the thought and strategy that went into selecting the JBG assets to merge with the Vornado Charles E. Smith portfolio and position the combined company for outsized growth. We strategically selected the best assets from the larger JBG pool of assets to complement the Vornado D.C. portfolio. Our objective was to create a combined portfolio with the unique profile by selecting strategic, high quality assets, both operating and land, with high-growth potential that reinforce key attributes, including: One, critical mass in core and metro serve markets; two, concentrations in complementary submarkets, particularly in mixed-use environments; three, it enhanced diversification; and four, strong value add opportunities. And we deliberately excluded assets that did not fit these objectives such as those in nonmetro served areas, highly leveraged GSA-leased buildings, near-term sale candidates and hotels, condominiums and townhouses. These assets will be sold as part of the natural wind down of legacy JBG funds.
Now let's move to the methodology we used to value the assets to be merged and the resulting ownership levels, which are the subject of Page 6. We vigorously underwrote and reviewed comps on each other's assets to arrive at fair market values for each side. As Steve said, asset pricing was done fairly and symmetrically with the net result being an implied weighted average cap rate of 5.1% on each sides operating assets. For the nonoperating assets, including under construction, development and land assets, we used a consistent return on cost and per pound methodology. Finally, to arrive at a value for each management company, we used a combination of valuation approaches, including multiples on precedent transactions and DCF analysis. The result is that Vornado's management company is being contributed at $80 million and JBG's companies being contributed at $335 million. A reflection of the fact that JBG generates 4 to 5 times more in third-party fees than Vornado D.C.'s management company. The bottom line is that Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the new company and JBG's management and LPs will own 26%.
Moving on to Page 7. It was critical to us that the transaction ensured total alignment of management interest with those of JBG SMITH shareholders. As Steve mentioned earlier, JBG SMITH will not raise new private investment funds. The JBG legacy funds are fully invested, no longer in acquisition mode and will be wind down. The only thing that matters is the shareholders. Importantly, the vast majority of the management team's network will be tied up in JBG SMITH stock. JBG management own approximately 6% of the combined company, putting it in the top decile of the companies. Of the JBG management company shares, 50% will vest immediately and be locked up for 3 years and 50% will vest over month's 31 to 60 and be locked up until the end of the fifth year. The management team will not receive promotes on contributed assets but will continue receiving promotes they're entitled to on legacy fund assets as the funds are wind down.
Finally, we are also instituting a $100 million formation equity grant award for a broad group of JBG's SMITH employees that is entirely performance-based to align interest deeper into the organization. To be clear, this award only becomes in the money if the stock goes up and is only worth $100 million if the stock doubles.
Let me move on to process and timing on Page 8. We expect to file the Form 10 by the end of this year, we'll complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of customary third-party consents and Hart–Scott–Rodino. There's no shareholder vote required on the Vornado side and JBG has already received all their investor approvals for the transaction, so closing is just a matter of time. The pro rata distribution ratio for Vornado shareholders will be 1:2, so investors will receive 1 share of JBG SMITH for every 2 shares of Vornado stock they own. Vornado will provide interim support services in areas such as IT, tax and SEC reporting pursuant to a transition services agreement.
Before turning over it to Matt, to discuss the prospects for JBG SMITH, let's first take a quick look at the post-spin Vornado. Pages 9 through 17 cover Vornado RemainCo, which is really the main event. With the separation of D.C, Vornado RemainCo will be the premier pure-play New York City REIT with a portfolio of irreplaceable, best-in-class office and high street retail assets in one of the best markets in the world and one where we're a clear leader. Upon completion of this transaction, 99% of our EBITDA, will come from our core New York real estate segment, including theMART and the 555 California. New York City, will itself account for 88% of our EBITDA after the spin-off, up from 70% today. All-in-all, it's a world-class business. Having divested non-core assets and now with this latest step, we hope investors will be better able to appreciate what a powerhouse our New York business is. We don't have time to cover every page in this section but the images and financial figures clearly demonstrate what a unique collection of assets we have, one we've spent years curating and which cannot be replicated. In addition, the figure show the impressive growth our New York business has historically delivered both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. The metrics are industry-leading.
So to sum up, as a New York City focused pure-play with a fortress balance sheet, attractive growth opportunities and a deep and experienced management team with a proven track record, Vornado will be well positioned to further enhance shareholder value.
Now let me turn the floor over to Matt Kelly to walk you through JBG SMITH Properties."

I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. m",2204,"Thanks, Michael and Steve, and thanks to you, all, for joining the call. I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.
For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. market for over 5 decades. We're known for our creative dealmaking and capital allocation skills and for our deep bench of development and value creation expertise across product types. While our D.C. market experience and office, residential and retail is unrivaled, we have been trendsetters in our market by mixing uses and projects that deliver the amenities and features that tenants demand. Concentrating in passive growth locations with metro access and deep retail potential have been key drivers of our success. We've been the most active player in the Washington market, and we are the definition of a local sharpshooter. We know our market block by block and see virtually every opportunity in the market.
Since 2000, we have acquired over 19 million square feet and have developed almost 18 million square feet of cross-sell product types. Our team has worked together for an average of 20 years and our leadership spans multiple generations. We have delivered top tier results for our investors with a leverage ROR of over 23% on $3.7 billion of equity deployed in over 250 investments across 9 discretionary funds. None of our funds have lost money even those that we initiated at the high point of the last cycle.
As shown on Page 20, the JBG team will form the senior-most leadership of this combined company. Most of us have spent our entire careers at JBG and have worked together managing capital on behalf of some of the best-known university endowments and foundations in the world.
Before closing, we will hire a CFO from outside the company with a focus on public market experience. In addition to the JBG team, Mitchell Schear will join our executive committee, and Jim Creedon, Patrick Tyrrell and Laurie Kramer of Vornado will serve in key EVP positions in the new company. As we combine the operating teams of both companies, we will be focused on efficiency, minimizing risk and combining the best from 2 great teams. The Washington Post rated JBG the #1 ranked large company to work for in our market across all industries and we intend for JBG SMITH to continue in that tradition of first class management and execution. Our team will have strong alignment with investors. We will own roughly 6% of the new company and our investment will represent the vast majority of the net worth of this team.
Let's move to Page 21 and talk about the combined company and why we're so excited about this opportunity. JBG SMITH will be the largest player in our market with some of the best existing assets and a market-leading development pipeline. We will be a powerhouse of a company with unmatched scale and access to growth opportunities. Our proven track record of delivering on mixed-use value creation and infill locations could not be a better match for an opportunity like Crystal City. What many have seen as a challenged office portfolio in a tough market, we see as an opportunity to pick off low-hanging fruit and position Crystal City as a vibrant amenity-rich destination within Washington. Combine this with the best-in-class balance sheet and the momentum of recovery in our market and we couldn't be more excited to get to work executing our vision for this new company.
Before I move on to the highlights of the company and the portfolio, a word about process. What I cover today will be high level. Prior to launch, we will follow-up with a deep dive roadshow to give investors much more granular information and an opportunity to meet us face-to-face. As you can see on Page 22, including assets under construction and near term starts, JBG SMITH will own 14 million square feet of commercial space and almost 6,000 apartment units making us the market-leading player in Washington with some of the best assets in the market.
On Page 23, you'll see that combining our portfolios comes with minimal overlap and creates an ownership profile concentrated in the complementary collection of the most sought after submarkets in the area. Over 98% of the portfolio is within half a mile of the planned or existing metro station. These assets, existing construction and future development have taken years in some cases, well over a decade to assemble, entitle, design and execute. No other player in our market has access to a growth pipeline like this. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of execution, we believe we can turn that into strong income growth and value creation.
Before we talk about future opportunities, I'll spend a minute on the existing portfolio and development assets that have recently delivered or commenced construction, which is summarized on Page 24. The combined portfolio has free rent burn-off and signed but not yet commenced leases totaling 590,000 square feet of occupancy. The combined company has 5 recently delivered apartment buildings totaling over 1,400 units at our share with average occupancy of 72% as of September 30. All 5 are on top of or next to a brand-new or planned grocery store and many have additional adjacent small stores. All are metro served and benefit from a rich base of amenities.
As you can see on Page 25, we have 4 trophy quality assets currently under construction totaling over 820,000 square feet. 3 of these are commercial assets, including CEB Tower in Rosslyn and retail projects adjacent to Reston Town Center and the Fester Road. These assets are 63% preleased with most of the balance of the lease-up consisting of 8 of the top 10 floors of CEB Tower, arguably the best building in the submarket with unobstructive views of the D.C. Mall and monumental core.
The fourth asset is a trophy apartment building facing the main entrance to National's Park that will sit amidst a new retail heavy entertainment district between the stadium and the Navy Yard Metro Station. All of these projects are fully capitalized.
Pages 26 and 27 cover our development pipeline, which includes a range of projects in various states of readiness for construction. Our near-term pipeline consists of 7 projects, of which 5 are mixed-use and 2 are standalone CBD trophy office buildings. By value and scale, roughly half our office and the balance, multifamily and retail. All of these projects are entitled, designed and substantially ready to commence construction. We expect that most, if not all of the retail and apartment projects will proceed in the short term. Based on current office market conditions, our bias is to patiently pursue pre-leases before going vertical, and we are currently following that strategy with the office asset listed here. We also intend to capitalize this company in a manner that will enable us to pursue all of these projects while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.
On Page 27, we've laid out a summary of the balance of the future development pipeline of this company. At over 17 million square feet, this is the largest treasure trove of growth opportunities you'll find in any company in our market. This pipeline will enable us to double the size of this company through assets entirely under our control today. I want to be clear on something here. We will not be levering this company to go hog-wild on development. We may be new to the public markets, but we are not new to capital allocation and the avoidance of risk. I'll cover that a little more when we talk about the balance sheet but first I want to address Crystal City specifically.
Crystal City is one of the most compelling opportunities in this company's portfolio. Its challenges were tailor-made for our toolkit of deep development expertise, retail experience and our placemaking-driven approach. It has everything going for it, including metro, critical mass, proximity to key demand drivers, views and great access not to mention, a jurisdiction with great schools and low taxes but it lacks a critical mass of amenities. It's existing amenities are compromised, underground retail with not enough anchor space and it lacks sufficient residential density to be a vibrant 24-hour place. The fix for these deficiencies is exactly the sort of thing we're best at creating and it's the skill set we've perfected throughout our 55-year history. When we've done this elsewhere, it has taken us years to assemble the critical mass to change a neighborhood. With Crystal City, the concentrated ownership is there Day 1. All that it requires is the right plan and sufficient time to implement it. We talked a lot about placemaking and changing neighborhoods and to some, this sounds like renovating dozens of assets and spending billions of dollars. That's not what we're talking about and that is not what Crystal City needs. Any great neighborhood needs a well-executed retail heart.
What we've done on Page 28 is to overlay the size of all of Crystal City on 3 of the most vibrant high-rent districts in our market, one of which we primarily created the Shaw Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest D.C. As you can see here, and zoomed in on Page 29, the heart of these neighborhoods is typically a very -- is typically very small, just a few blocks. This heart has multiple anchors, plenty of services, banks, dry cleaners et cetera, but it also has a carefully curated mix of amenity retail. Local shops, maker shops, streetscape, parking, green space et cetera. It also has enough residential to be a place worth visiting after work hours. If it's truly special it will have 1 or more destination anchors often entertainment-based. The point is that repositioning a large concentration of asset like Crystal City does not require the renovation of the entire place. To the contrary, it only requires the right execution of a relatively small subset of the neighborhood requiring far less capital. Done right, that well-planned heart can drive outside occupancy and rent growth in all of the neighboring uses.
The age of building stock, on Page 28, is included to demonstrate that while all of these submarkets have older building stock than Crystal City, they all rent at a premium because they are great amnestied vibrant places. That's the missing ingredient. We'll have much more detail on our plans for Crystal City down the road, but I want to repeat that it is one of the elements of this new company that we're most excited about.
Now let's talk about capitalization on Page 30. We intend to launch this company with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet with deep capacity to fund future growth without over leveraging the company. In addition to a very manageable debt maturity profile, we will have an appropriately sized credit facility for access to immediate capital and flexibility but our debt financing strategy will not rely on corporate debt. Long-term financing will be done on a nonrecourse basis at the asset level. We will also be aggressive about identifying opportunities to recycle within the portfolio by selling our joint venturing selected assets whose market value exceeds replacement costs and deploying that capital into newer higher growth, internal investments and potential acquisitions.
Finally, on Page 31, a word about our market. Washington's office market has had a rough run for almost a decade. In the office market, our average 5-year net absorption was negative 250,000 square feet versus a 20-year average of positive 3.3 million square feet. Although many private sector players rightsized after sequestration and BRAC, the wreckage in the office market has taken a long time to recover. With much of that tenant rightsizing behind us, and most recently, our best job growth year in a decade, we believe that Washington is poised to grow in the coming years where much of the rest of the country has began to flatten out or even soften. This counter cyclicality is not atypical for our market. We further believe that growth will be concentrated in the places that offer what tenants and consumers want, vibrant retail, services, amenities, walkability and transit.
On the apartment side having the highest median household income in the country and a lower rent share of wallet than other Gateway cities supports much of the strong apartment absorption we've seen in spite of high levels of supply. When for-sale housing is added to the mix, our total housing units have actually been in line with demand. So this outcome has not been surprising. All of these translate us to conclude that Washington has a healthy base, from which to grow in the coming years, especially in infill submarkets that offer what tenants demand. As I said before, we look forward to meeting with investors prior to launch to provide a deep dive review of the portfolio and our strategy. We're very excited about this opportunity and we believe this powerhouse of the company will be an incredible platform to deliver strong shareholder value over time.
Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap up."

First of all, it was done very carefully. Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was.

Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG, in its current state, has a EBITDA somewhere in the mid-40s. That's after all expenses or what have you. That's what's come to the bottom line of the current JBG. We are -- our advisers and our exploration into the comps is, is that these companies and trade for between 9x and 10x. So If you take a midpoint on that, that means the, let's say, call it, $45 million of EBITDA coming out of a JBG would be worth somewhere, $400 million, maybe a little bit higher. And the reason maybe a little bit higher is because it's the premier company in its marketplace, and it would probably sell for a premium. So if the JBG partners were to sell this company in it's current incarnation, as the going concern, and we think market value by of that is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million, step one. Step two is, that's approximately the number or in a range of what we were talking about when we engaged with JBG a couple of years ago, and that's even less than the number that the -- was negotiated in the famous or infamous NYRT transaction. So I would have [ph], say that. So our number was $335 million. That's not in cash. That is in script. And so the value of that, that was -- and what happens is they are going to be getting a percentage of the company in shares, and those shares will fluctuate. So if they fluctuate down, that's where they fluctuate and whatever. Now we also valued our management company at $80 million. I can tell you that our management company has 0 EBITDA. So the way we looked at it, we paid a -- the Vornado shareholder paid a net $335 million less $80 million or $255 million for the JBG platform, the whole shooting match: The team, all their employees and what have you. Now I've already talked about what the going concern value of JBG was. Let's talk about what the value would be to us. Well, to us, the net was for $255 million. And we've already said that we're going to run off -- we're not going to do any more funds, and we're going to run off of the assets that were excluded. Those assets that are excluded have a fee stream which is pretty substantial, and the discounted value of that is somewhere between $175 million, maybe even up to $200 million, depending upon the discount rate you use. So now we get that our $335 million goes down to $255 million because of the value of our management company and then goes down to -- let's use a number of $175 million, $180 million. So it goes down to $60 million, $70 million is the net cost of this whole platform to us. But that's not the end of the story. By combining the JBG platform and the Vornado existing platform, there are synergies. Those synergies are, we believe, gross $35-ish million, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. And then that doesn't -- if you have to deduct from that the cost of being a separate public company, which we're guesstimating at, call it, somewhere between $12 million, $15 million. So maybe -- Michael is telling he thinks it's less. But let's say -- so maybe we think the net synergies of combining the 2 companies are, pick a number, $20 million to $25 million less than it would be, okay? Well, that has a value and is very favorable compared to the net $60 million, $70 million price of buying this platform. So that's the math, which is you can tell, I think from Mike fairly detailed remarks, was very carefully analyzed and thought about. Now let's go to the last point. Would you rather own the company with JBG combined, that would be worth less, let's say, $50 million is a $0.25 of Vornado share, $0.25. Would you rather have the combined company with it assets, it's opportunities of the future and the leading management platform in the marketplace, even if it cost you a $0.25 of $0.30 to do that?

When we make the rounds with a much more deep dive roadshow, we will get into specifics as to what -- projects that are soon to start and how we've made the capital allocation decisions. But generally speaking, we respond to market conditions. As I said earlier, being called a developer I think sometimes is a bad word in this business because there are a lot of folks out there who gotten it wrong, who have done too much, too fast, don't pay attention to supply and demand and overbuild. That has not been our history. That is, I think, one of the primary reasons why we have outperformed and over delivered. And as we think about development, it's primarily rooted on what will add value and strength to the portfolio over time and what is most responsive to market conditions, not just market conditions today, but as we look out 2, 3, 4, 5 years and where we see supply and demand trends going, what will play into those trends and what to be the most valuable assets to own long term."

They -- the land that we -- I don't look at the land as a land. I look at it as future buildings, okay? And I look at those future buildings as profit opportunity. So first of all, the locations of all of these opportunities are the best in the Washington region by far. So we have -- first of all, it's big, really big. Second of all, it's in the best submarkets in depth. The third thing is, is that this is an opportunity to create new buildings at outsized returns, which are substantially better than you could buy a similar building in a similar location on a return basis, which means that there is a profit to a big profit in this land as you develop it over time. Now there's a trend going on in the world today. A, new buildings are much more valuable than old buildings. B, there's obsolescence in real estate. So that when you're building a new building, you can make it state of the art, what the customer wants, whether it's an office building or a residential building. And three, the capital, maintenance capital for a new building is like almost 0 for the first 10 years or so as opposed to an older building. So this portfolio of opportunity, we look upon it as opportunity, is one of the things that makes this a unique investment opportunity."

We will be supplementing the team with folks who have deep public market expertise in the areas that you described because it's critical that we get that right. And we will. The first part of your question with respect to flexibility, I think there is a misperception that somehow, you can't be nimble if you're in the public markets or that you can't take advantage of opportunities, perhaps, in the same way you might do in private markets. I just don't buy that. I think good real estate decisions are good real estate decisions, whether you're public or private. And I think one of the things of that we have demonstrated in our history, as we have moved from being a syndicator to a fund manager to a fund manager with lots of the joint venture relationships and other things, that in fact, no matter what your capital structure and your legal structure and your ownership structure is, you can still attack and pursue aggressively the best real estate decisions and take advantage of the best opportunities in the market.

We understand the importance of, frankly, not overpromising. And as you said at the very beginning of your question, we are going to be very prudent as to what we develop and when we develop it. But when you talk about existing assets and their performance, you really can't talk about that separate and distinct from new developments because a lot of what we do, and in particular if you look at Crystal City, a lot of what we will do is predicated on improving that as a place.

The reality is that, that is the by-product of all the work product. And we had a downtown portfolio that's better than JBG's and it's a lower cap rate than that; and Crystal City is more capital-intensive, it's higher. So it just so happened, coincidentally, that's where it came out. And I really mean that. We have a buildup of what your assets go in. Obviously, we'd spent a lot of time crafting which assets we pulled in because we want this company built for success, but it's somewhat coincidental that they end up with the same number. The methodology was consistent in terms of district-to-district and submarket-to-submarket, and it just so happened to end up there. I think we probably have a little more capital intensity on our assets, given Crystal City, than JBG does. And so therefore, they probably have a bit more embedded growth on the other assets.

And that's a mixed-use project, retail-heavy, grocery-anchored, lots of apartments, right in the strike zone of what we do. And then the one you just described, which is the Summit office buildings in Reston Town Center West, RTC West, which some of you may recognize. That was a former Reston Executive Center, which we actually acquired from Vornado. That is not only an existing office building, but you'll see in the presentation, it is also one of the new development projects. That is an asset where we are delivering retail, the RTC West retail on Page 25, it's about 40,000 square feet of ground-floor, small-store retail that is designed to amenitize those buildings. That asset sits right in between Boston properties, Reston Town Center and the exit platform to the new under construction Metro station. And so it is right in the footpath connecting those 2, and that retail, we believe, will be phenomenally successful. It has already been successful in enabling us to lease that building. This is against a backdrop of Northern Virginia suburban office. It's enabled us to lease that building with the retail only roughly half preleased and not yet delivered, to lease of that building fully and at rents that exceed where they were when we acquired it by 20%. That's against the backdrop of a market that has been flat and that has, as you heard me articulate earlier, had negative net absorption. And so that is a micro case study of the power of amenities and the power of retail. And that's even before the Metro has shown up."

In fact, above trends from last year. And on average, basically, with kind of 10-year trends. In terms of rents, we have continued to see rents remain stable. I think some of our competitors have said, and I'll echo it, that we've seen moderately increasing concessions. Some of that relates to, in fact, construction cost, so the cost of building space has escalated significantly. So with that, some of the TI packages, in fact, have increased. And then I think most importantly, what I would emphasize is that what we're seeing in New York is a continuing of very, very good diversification of trends in terms of the nature of [indiscernible]. So I'll go back and I'll tell you, back in 1990, as we looked at office sector jobs, 1 out of every 2 office sector jobs at the time was financial services-related. As we look at the city today, that number today is less than 1 out of every 3. So although there's been a lot published about the lack of growth in financial services, in fact, to some extent, a continuing slight loss in financial services jobs, the reality is, as you look at the overall health of the city and the diversification of job growth, I think it's as good as we've ever seen. I also will just reemphasize what I said, and that is we are in a mature recovery. We had seen office sector job come down from the peak that we saw over the 2011 to basically '14, '15 period of time. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still seeing very good office sector job growth, somewhere around 14,000, 15,000 jobs, which translates into about 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of absorption. So continuing trends, I will tell you we are continuing to see pretty good growth."

I don't have an exact percentage for you as to what's ready to go on the $17 million right now that we've tried to articulate that in the near-term development pipeline. All of that is ready to go. There is a large proportion of the $17 million that is matter of right, which is to say that it is consistent with underlying zoning. But in many of the jurisdictions in Washington, in order to be able to pull a building permit, you have to do a lot of work and get something closer to the start line. Some of those assets are, some of them are not. We will go through in detail and bucket those things so that investors will have a lot of transparency as to what's in that. On your first question about how we will capitalize assets, we intend to be stingy with the equity of this company. And only when we are trading at what we think are very attractive values, ideally premiums to net asset value, will issuing equity even be considered a possibility for us. When it comes to flexibility and how we finance things, there are a number of assets in this portfolio, that, if we believe we can recycle within the portfolio by selling assets at values that dramatically exceed replacement costs, we will do that and deploy that capital into net new value creation opportunities, in particular where the yields on costs are high. And when we look at yields on costs, we don't look at yield on cost from the standpoint of incremental cost only. We look at yields on costs from the standpoint of what is our land actually worth and what is the yield on cost for the new project inclusive of that land value. Because if that doesn't pencil, then it points more toward simply selling your land. And that's a well-trodden path for us as well as the thought process. When it comes to capital sources, I've talked about project-level leverage, nonrecourse asset-level financing. We also have, by virtue of our third-party capital business, a ton of relationships that we have cultivated over decades of prospective joint venture partners. Many of them will be much happier that we are in a permanent capital structure than in a finite life vehicle. Because many of the best partners out there want a partner who will hang around with them potentially forever if that's the plan and not have an artificial arbitrary exit date imposed upon them by virtue of a fund life. Those partners are folks that can be selectively resources and capital providers, often at times when the REIT markets are not the most efficient source of capital, to fund new opportunities. We will have to weigh that against how much of an asset we want to own, how much of the VIG [ph] do we want to own in a project versus how much do we want to share with an investment partner. And frankly, are we getting enough out of the deal with that partner to warrant doing that. But that analysis is one that is -- really forms a bedrock of how and when we have decided to do everything that we've done throughout our history. And that won't be changing in this new construct."

As I've said before, the most import",1393,"Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.
A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most important metric we look at are employment numbers, in particular, office using jobs. Private sector employment is up about 80,000 jobs for the trailing 12 months and at 3,773,000 jobs is at an all-time high. Office using employment is also up 14,000 jobs year-over-year and had 1,373,000 jobs, again, it is an all-time high. While this rate of growth for office sector jobs is less than the 35,000 average annual increase over the past 6 years since the recovery kicked in, we are still seeing good office job growth later in the cycle, increasing at a bit over 1% per annum. Most of the brokerage houses have reported modestly increasing space availability levels, both for the quarter and the year-to-date of about 50 basis points. No big deal. Asking rents remain at/or near-record levels and leasing activity for the first 9 months at over 27 million square feet is up about 4% from last year and on par with 10-year averages. What we have seen is a shifting of tenant demand away from commoditized buildings, which are not leasing well to new and updated buildings, which are seeing good activity as tenants seek more modern and efficient space. We anticipated this trend early, having completed 6.5 million square feet of high-quality building repositionings in the last 4 years alone. Our fleet is in great shape.
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. As expected, our occupancy at the end of the third quarter fell slightly by 50 basis points to 95.5%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Customs Service vacating nearly 150,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza for a long planned return to the World Trade Center. We have already leased about 50,000 square feet of that space and have a strong pipeline to fill out the remainder.
For the quarter, we leased 335,000 square feet in 40 transactions at average starting rents of $68.11, representing mark-to-market of 7.1% GAAP and 6.2% cash. About 40% of leasing activity was in Penn Plaza. Let me remind you that this reduced level of activity is a reflection of the fact that during the past 3 years: 2013, '14 and '15, we leased the better part of 9 million square feet handling our major future expirations.
A couple of examples. In 11 Penn Plaza, we entered into long-term renewals with AMC Network and Macy's for an aggregate of 975,000 square feet. At Two Penn Plaza, we renewed MSG for 325,000 square feet. And where we knew we would have space coming back to us, we completed headquarters leases with Neuberger Berman for over 400,000 square feet in 1290 Sixth Avenue and with Amazon for 470,000 square feet at 7 West 34th Street, all space that was otherwise coming back to us in the 2017, 2018 period of time. We remain basically full and our expirations are modest with just 113,000 square feet of leases expiring for the balance of this year and only 600,000 square feet in all of 2017, with no one tenant representing more than 75,000 square feet. We have a robust pipeline including more than 560,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and another 700,000 square feet in active discussions.
Last month, a joint venture of Vornado and the related companies, a natural marriage teaming up the largest owners in Penn Plaza and Hudson Yards, was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic McKim, Mead & White-designed Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan train hall serving Long Island Railroad and Amtrak passengers, which will be constructed by Skanska. As Governor Cuomo described last month, the great -- the train hall will be a grand civic space at 250,000 square feet, larger than the main hall at Grand Central, the train hall will increase the floor space for the commuting public by over 50%. Over 90 feet above the main train passenger level there'll be a grand skylight supported by historic trusses to allow light to stream into the train hall. The Vornado-related joint venture will acquire approximately 850,000 rentable square feet in the building to be developed into creative office space and ancillary train hall retail for an upfront payment of $230 million. The Farley building adds to our growing portfolio of new office developments on the Westside, including 61 Ninth, 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh and 85 Tenth Avenue. The interior of the original Farley building, a postal facility, was built as a warehouse with great 17-plus foot floor-to-floor ceiling heights and floor place averaging over 200,000 rentable square feet. It has the same spectacular bones as our 770 Broadway here in New York and theMART in Chicago, both of which have proven to be best-in-class creative space for a creative office class tenants such as Facebook and Google. We are confident that this building also will contribute to the ongoing repositioning of our Penn Plaza portfolio as a hub for high-quality TAMI tenants seeking to locate via the most important transportation hub in New York. Governor Cuomo and his team deserve enormous credit for advancing this important project. We are proud to have been designated and look forward to working with the state and the railroads to deliver the governor's vision of a grand gateway to New York City.
Turning now to our premier street retail portfolio. During the third quarter, we leased 7,500 square feet with strong positive mark-to-market's of 69.2% GAAP and 53.4% cash. Occupancy ticked up 180 basis points to 96.7%. Ed Hogan, who runs our retail leasing machine in New York, would tell you that over the last couple of months, we have seen retail leasing activity increase with the entry of some new tenants into the market and interest from cosmetics tenants, intimate apparel and food retailers.
As Steve mentioned, we invite you to visit our 640 Fifth Avenue property, where just last week, Victoria's Secret opened their 4 levels stunning new 64,000-square-foot flagship store. To enable to Victoria's Secret to complete its fit out and open for the important holiday season, we completely restacked and repositioned the former H&M space in record time working 3 shifts a day and delivering the space to Victoria's Secret in February.
At the adjacent 3,000-square-foot store with 25 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, Nespresso last week opened a pop-up store for the holiday season, and we have a long-term lease out for the space with a tenant, which will open its first flagship retail store in New York.
At theMART in Chicago, same-store numbers for the third quarter were a very strong positive 12.4% GAAP and 5.5% cash. Great tenants continue to be attracted to the innovation-focused space at theMART, and we're proud of the quality of the 2 tenants we added in the third quarter, Kellogg and Caterpillar. Adding these household names to an already blue-chip roster continues to reinforce the preeminence of this unique asset. We leased 20,000 square feet of office space, at average starting rents of $47.46, representing mark-to-market's of 58.2% cash. These leases brought our occupancy up by 40 basis points to 98.2%.
In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street, we leased 72,000 square feet this quarter, including a 54,000-square-foot renewal lease with McKinsey & Company. With average starting rents of around $90 per square feet, we believe the building's position as the premier office building in San Francisco is clear. Our amenity-rich redevelopment of the  concourse level should be completed around year-end, and we're also making very good progress with potential tenants for the former Bank of America banking hall that we call the Cube.
Overall, for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with a same-store increase of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash or an even stronger 6.5% cap and 11.7% cash, excluding The Hotel Pennsylvania, which really tells a truer history. The hotel business in New York continues to feel the impact of oversupply in the market on both occupancy and pricing.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Theriot."

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136",688,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136.2 million or $0.72 per share. After adjusting for net gains and other items that affect comparability in both periods, adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter is $0.39 or $0.02 above the prior year's third quarter.
FFO, as adjusted, which we formerly called comparable FFO, was $1.24 per share for the third quarter or $0.03 above the prior year's third quarter. See Page 39 of our Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of FFO and FFO as adjusted.
Our Fed ratio exceeded 100% in the first and second quarters and is 95.5% for the third quarter. Our Fed ratio will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as a result of the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity in the last 2 years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our fed ratio will return to its normal loss level in the mid-80s by the end of 2017.
As David noted, our New York business had a strong quarter with same-store increases of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, it is an even stronger 6.5% GAAP and 11.7% cash.
On to our Washington business. As noted on Page 48 of our Form 10-Q, we reaffirmed our guidance for our New York business for the full year 2016, I'm sorry, Washington -- our Washington business for the full 2016. Within that guidance, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance for core operations of flat to up $4 million. The leasing pace at the Bartlett is running at an incredible 60 units per month. Since we opened the rental office in June of this year, we have leased over 65% of the units of this 699 unit project, a big testament to the quality of the development and the competitiveness of the product. We have leased 455 units and the rental office just opened 5 months ago -- just incredible. We leased 177,000 square feet of office space in Washington, excluding Skyline, with mark-to-markets of negative 4.8% GAAP and negative 10.3% cash. Quarter end occupancy of the Washington portfolio, excluding Skyline, was 91.1%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter.
Now to capital markets activity in the quarter. We completed a 5-year, $675 million refinancing of theMART at a 2.7% fixed rate. This loan replaces the 5.75% $555 million mortgage that was scheduled to mature in December. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% series J preferred shares at par or 400 -- $246.3 million in the aggregate, which will result in savings of $17 million or $0.08 per share per year. We have virtually no remaining consolidated debt maturities in 2016 and our 2017 maturities are $360 million. Our share of partially owned entities debt maturities is $33 million for the remainder of 2016 and $89 million for 2017.
Excluding Skyline and the financing for our 220 Central Park South project, which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.81% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years.
Debt-to-enterprise value was 26%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.5x, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys ""R"" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.4x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.
I will now turn the call back to Steve."

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction. A few years ago, in response to a chronically undervalued stock price and, admittedly, too complex and diffused collection of assets and businesses, we began a program to simplify and focus the company, all with an objective of daylighting our treasure trove of assets and creating value. As I said at that time, everything was on the table and that we would leave no stone unturned. We have since exited business lines and none core investments, gotten out of the mall business, sold-out of the showroom business, retaining, of course, the giant 3.7 million square foot Chicago Mart building. We spun off our shopping center business into Urban Edge Properties. All told, this activity totaled $9.1 billion. Of course, along the way, we acquired and developed assets into our core, all the while upgrading the mix and quality of our portfolio.
Last evening, we announced another major milestone. The spinning off of our Washington, D.C. business and simultaneous merger with The JBG Companies and what is known in the trade as a tax-free spin merge transaction or technically, a  Reverse Morris Trust. A little history here: we acquired our Washington business in 2002 at the right time in the cycle and at a great price. We have since built it through acquisition and development to be the largest owner in the region. In 2011, we suffered a double whammy when the Department of Defense and related contractors began vacating what would total 2.5 million square feet under the BRAC statute just as the Washington office market was softening. At the nadir, we suffered a $70 million hit to annual income. Even though our flagship New York business powered through and its growth well exceeded the hit from Washington, our stock price has suffered. What to do? For various reasons, selling the Washington business was not an option, nor did we want to sell it at the bottom. Some would say that by not selling, we are actually buying and that's sort of true. We do like the Washington market place, and we do like our assets in Washington, especially at that price. So no sell but we did believe the best strategy was to separate Washington and New York for reasons that I will speak about in a minute. The tax-free spin-off was the perfect solution. Spinning our Washington business as-is would have been just an okay execution but combining it with the market leader, JBG, would be a blockbuster. At that point, we initiated an approach to JBG and began a courtship.
3 things happened: one, we got to know each other very well; two, the JBG gang began to appreciate that the permanent capital and scale of the public company format maybe an even better business model than their private fund model; and three, I decided at that time not to proceed. I simply couldn't get comfortable with serving 2 masters, their private limited partners and our public shareholders. This time around, we have it exactly correct. There will be no new funds and the existing funds will run off. We all, management, the board and shareholders will all worship at the altar of stock price, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
JBG having caught the bug pursued an IPO, pursued a merger with several other already public candidates and finally made a deal with NYRT, which I believe everyone on the call is probably familiar with. Maybe the JBG guys stubbed their toes on the NYRT deal, maybe not, whatever. There were lessons learned there and these guys are very fast learners. But I can assure you that the JBG team are great real estaters and great moneymakers and after all, that's what I'm after. I cannot emphasize enough the capability of the 150 person JBG team. This is the real price in this deal. Key business terms and important information regarding our JBG SMITH transaction are available in the press release and investor presentation on our website at www.vno.com. A couple of points before Michael takes you through the investor deck. Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the combined company. JBG limited partners are expected to own approximately 20% and JB [sic] [ JBG ] management is expected to own approximately 6%, all of those percentages being subject to closing adjustments. The combined company will be led by JBG's senior management team. Critically, management's interest will be perfectly aligned with shareholders' interest. They will be huge equity holders of restricted stock and units with appropriate vesting and lock-up periods. Management will certainly be eating its own cooking. We very carefully selected, which JBG assets would be included, always with an eye towards future growth. Valuations were determined fairly and absolutely symmetrically.
JBG SMITH Board of Trustees will consist of 12 members, a majority of whom will be independent. Vornado and JBG will each designate 6 trustees. I will be Chairman of the Board. Matt Kelly will be Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. We expect to file our Form-10 in December, and we expect to complete the distribution and combination in the second quarter of 2017. Vornado's board has already approved the transaction and JBG's investors have consented. This is a great deal for Vornado. This is a great deal for Vornado and its shareholders. It was very carefully constructed. It is transformative and it accomplishes many of our most important goals. It creates 2 highly focused pure plays each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card. And each of the 2 will be the largest and the leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York or Washington or both as they choose, no bundling here.
The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than 4 times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York's treasured trove of assets and superior financial performance. Importantly, it is the big fix for Washington. JBG SMITH will be the market leading power house with unrivaled portfolio of substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG SMITH has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the country and the math works. At its simplest, pure-play New York, unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better. And Washington with JBG management has to perform and trade much better. I'll say it again. At its simplest, pure New York unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better, and Washington, with JBG management, has to perform and trade much better. Simply stated, that's why this is a great deal.
Now I'll turn it over to Michael who will take you through the investor presentation."

Turning now to the slide deck we posted on our website last night. There's a lot of detail in there. We won't review all of it on this call, but I'm going to take you through the highlights. Starting on Page 1.
I want to start by reiterating that this transaction is a continuation of the strategy Vornado began several years ago to simplify and focus our business. When all is said and done, we will have driven significant shareholder value by creating 3 best-in-class, pure-play, publicly traded REITs. Urban Edge with its growth-oriented focus and portfolio of retail assets and high barrier centers, a highly focused New York City-centric Vornado with premier office assets and the only publicly investable, high street retail portfolio of significant scale and JBG SMITH, which will be the largest, pure-play and soon-to-be power house Washington, D.C. real estate company.
Page 2 provides an overview of the transaction. Vornado is spinning off its Washington, D.C. business and JBG is merging in its operating company and a portfolio of selected assets. It's a marriage of the 2 largest and most well-respected real estate organization from the D.C. market, the product of which will be the market-leading pure-play D.C. real estate company. The combined transaction value is $8.4 billion. Much likely to set up Urban Edge, JBG SMITH will be well-capitalized with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet designed to execute on its business plan. As Steve said earlier, Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74%, JBG's current limited partners, approximately 20% and JBG management, approximately 6%. We'll talk more about how we derived these percentages in a moment.
And as we'll review shortly, we've taken steps to totally align the interest of JBG SMITH management and its shareholders. In addition, while this deal was motivated by strategic considerations about the opportunities in Washington, D.C. there will be significant cost synergies totaling about $35 million before accounting for public company costs from combining complementary portfolios and platforms. Creating an overhead cost structure inline with best-in-class peers. As for Vornado RemainCo, it will be the premier, pure-play New York city real estate company. We expect to be aggregate of Vornado RemainCo and JBG SMITH dividends will be at least equal to Vornado's current dividend. Finally, we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Page 3 shows you the statistics and makeup of the combined portfolio from this transaction. The asset quality and our urban infill concentration of the 79 asset operating portfolio and almost 20 million-square-foot development pipeline will stand head and shoulders above its competitors. The combined portfolio is diversified in terms of property asset classes and also geographies in the Metro D.C. region, where we'll have a significant presence in the best submarkets: Downtown D.C, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Reston and Bethesda. JBG SMITH will be in an excellent position to drive outsized returns and value over time with its unmatched portfolio.
Steve covered the strategic rationale for the transaction at the outset, so let's move to Page 5. This page provides an overview of the thought and strategy that went into selecting the JBG assets to merge with the Vornado/Charles E. Smith portfolio and position the combined company for outsized growth. We strategically selected the best assets from the larger JBG pool of assets to complement the Vornado D.C. portfolio. Our objective was to create a combined portfolio with the unique profile by selecting strategic, high quality assets, both operating and land, with high-growth potential that reinforce key attributes, including: one, critical mass in core and Metro-served markets; two, concentrations in complementary submarkets, particularly in mixed-use environments; three, it enhanced diversification; and four, strong value-add opportunities. And we deliberately excluded assets that did not fit these objectives such as those in non-Metro-served areas, highly leveraged GSA-leased buildings, near-term sale candidates and hotels, condominiums and townhouses. These assets will be sold as part of the natural wind down of legacy JBG funds.
Now let's move to the methodology we used to value the assets to be merged and the resulting ownership levels, which are the subject of Page 6. We rigorously underwrote and reviewed comps on each other's assets to arrive at fair market values for each side. As Steve said, asset pricing was done fairly and symmetrically with the net result being an implied weighted average cap rate of 5.1% on each sides operating assets. For the nonoperating assets, including under construction, development and land assets, we used a consistent return on cost and per pound methodology. Finally, to arrive at a value for each management company, we used a combination of valuation approaches, including multiples on precedent transactions and DCF analysis. The result is that Vornado's management company is being contributed at $80 million and JBG's companies being contributed at $335 million. A reflection of the fact that JBG generates 4 to 5 times more in third-party fees than Vornado D.C.'s management company. The bottom line is that Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the new company and JBG's management and LPs will own 26%.
Moving on to Page 7. It was critical to us that the transaction ensured total alignment of management interests with those of JBG SMITH shareholders. As Steve mentioned earlier, JBG SMITH will not raise new private investment funds. The JBG legacy funds are fully invested, no longer in acquisition mode and will be wound down. The only thing that matters is the shareholders. Importantly, the vast majority of the management team's net worth will be tied up in JBG SMITH stock. JBG management own approximately 6% of the combined company, putting it in the top decile of the companies. Of the JBG management company shares, 50% will vest immediately and be locked up for 3 years and 50% will vest over month's 31 to 60 and be locked up until the end of the fifth year. The management team will not receive promotes on contributed assets but will continue receiving promotes they're entitled to on legacy fund assets as the funds are wound down.
Finally, we are also instituting a $100 million formation equity grant award for a broad group of JBG SMITH employees that is entirely performance-based to align interest deeper into the organization. To be clear, this award only becomes in the money if the stock goes up and is only worth $100 million if the stock doubles.
Let me move on to process and timing on Page 8. We expect to file the Form 10 by the end of this year. We'll complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of customary third-party consents in Hart–Scott–Rodino. There's no shareholder vote required on the Vornado side and JBG has already received all their investor approvals for the transaction, so closing is just a matter of time. The pro rata distribution ratio for Vornado shareholders will be 1:2, so investors will receive 1 share of JBG SMITH for every 2 shares of Vornado stock they own. Vornado will provide interim support services in areas such as IT, tax and SEC reporting pursuant to a transition services agreement.
Before turning over it to Matt, to discuss the prospects for JBG SMITH, let's first take a quick look at the post-spin Vornado. Pages 9 through 17 cover Vornado RemainCo, which is really the main event. With the separation of D.C, Vornado RemainCo will be the premier pure-play New York City REIT with a portfolio of irreplaceable, best-in-class office and high street retail assets in one of the best markets in the world and one where we're a clear leader. Upon completion of this transaction, 99% of our EBITDA, will come from our core New York real estate segment, including theMART and the 555 California. New York City, will itself account for 88% of our EBITDA after the spin-off, up from 70% today. All-in-all, it's a world-class business. Having divested noncore assets and now with this latest step, we hope investors will be better able to appreciate what a powerhouse our New York business is. We don't have time to cover every page in this section but the images and financial figures clearly demonstrate what a unique collection of assets we have, one we've spent years curating and which cannot be replicated. In addition, the figure shows the impressive growth our New York business has historically delivered both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. The metrics are industry-leading.
So to sum up, as a New York City focused pure-play with a fortress balance sheet, attractive growth opportunities and a deep and experienced management team with a proven track record, Vornado will be well-positioned to further enhance shareholder value.
Now let me turn the floor over to Matt Kelly to walk you through JBG SMITH Properties."

I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. m",2203,"Thanks, Michael and Steve, and thanks to you, all, for joining the call. I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.
For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. market for over 5 decades. We're known for our creative dealmaking and capital allocation skills and for our deep bench of development and value-creation expertise across product types. While our D.C. market experience and office, residential and retail is unrivaled, we have been trendsetters in our market by mixing uses and projects that deliver the amenities and features that tenants demand. Concentrating in passive growth locations with Metro access and deep retail potential have been key drivers of our success. We've been the most active player in the Washington market, and we are the definition of a local sharpshooter. We know our market block by block and see virtually every opportunity in the market.
Since 2000, we have acquired over 19 million square feet and have developed almost 18 million square feet of cross-sell product types. Our team has worked together for an average of 20 years and our leadership spans multiple generations. We have delivered top tier results for our investors with a leveraged ROR of over 23% on $3.7 billion of equity deployed in over 250 investments across 9 discretionary funds. None of our funds have lost money even those that we initiated at the high point of the last cycle.
As shown on Page 20, the JBG team will form the senior-most leadership of this combined company. Most of us have spent our entire careers at JBG and have worked together managing capital on behalf of some of the best-known university endowments and foundations in the world.
Before closing, we will hire a CFO from outside the company with a focus on public market experience. In addition to the JBG team, Mitchell Schear will join our executive committee, and Jim Creedon, Patrick Tyrrell and Laurie Kramer of Vornado will serve in key EVP positions in the new company. As we combine the operating teams of both companies, we will be focused on efficiency, minimizing risk and combining the best from 2 great teams. The Washington Post rated JBG the #1 ranked large company to work for in our market across all industries and we intend for JBG SMITH to continue in that tradition of first class management and execution. Our team will have strong alignment with investors. We will own roughly 6% of the new company and our investment will represent the vast majority of the net worth of this team.
Let's move to Page 21 and talk about the combined company and why we're so excited about this opportunity. JBG SMITH will be the largest player in our market with some of the best existing assets and a market-leading development pipeline. We will be a powerhouse of a company with unmatched scale and access to growth opportunities. Our proven track record of delivering on mixed-use value creation and infill locations could not be a better match for an opportunity like Crystal City. What many have seen as a challenged office portfolio in a tough market, we see as an opportunity to pick off low-hanging fruit and position Crystal City as a vibrant amenity-rich destination within Washington. Combine this with the best-in-class balance sheet and the momentum of recovery in our market and we couldn't be more excited to get to work executing our vision for this new company.
Before I move on to the highlights of the company and the portfolio, a word about process. What I cover today will be high level. Prior to launch, we will follow-up with a deep dive roadshow to give investors much more granular information and an opportunity to meet us face-to-face. As you can see on Page 22, including assets under construction and near term starts, JBG SMITH will own 14 million square feet of commercial space and almost 6,000 apartment units making us the market-leading player in Washington with some of the best assets in the market.
On Page 23, you'll see that combining our portfolios comes with minimal overlap and creates an ownership profile concentrated in the complementary collection of the most sought after submarkets in the area. Over 98% of the portfolio is within half a mile of a planned or existing Metro station. These assets, existing construction and future development have taken years.  In some cases, well over a decade to assemble, entitle, design and execute. No other player in our market has access to a growth pipeline like this. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of execution, we believe we can turn that into strong income growth and value creation.
Before we talk about future opportunities, I'll spend a minute on the existing portfolio and development assets that have recently delivered or commenced construction, which is summarized on Page 24. The combined portfolio has free rent burn-off and signed but not yet commenced leases totaling 590,000 square feet of occupancy. The combined company has 5 recently delivered apartment buildings totaling over 1,400 units at our share with average occupancy of 72% as of September 30. All 5 are on top of or next to a brand-new or planned grocery store and many have additional adjacent small stores. All are Metro-served and benefit from a rich base of amenities.
As you can see on Page 25, we have 4 trophy quality assets currently under construction totaling over 820,000 square feet. Three of these are commercial assets, including CEB Tower in Rosslyn and retail projects adjacent to Reston Town Center and Bethesda row. these assets are 63% preleased with most of the balance of the leased-up consisting of 8 of the top 10 floors of CEB Tower, arguably the best building in the submarket with unobstructive views of the D.C. Mall and monumental core.
The fourth asset is a trophy apartment building facing the main entrance to National's Park that will sit amidst a new retail heavy entertainment district between the stadium and the Navy Yard Metro Station. All of these projects are fully capitalized.
Pages 26 and 27 cover our development pipeline, which includes a range of projects in various states of readiness for construction. Our near-term pipeline consists of 7 projects, of which 5 are mixed-use and 2 are standalone CBD trophy office buildings. By value and scale, roughly half our office and the balance, multifamily and retail. All of these projects are entitled, designed and substantially ready to commence construction. We expect that most, if not all of the retail and apartment projects will proceed in the short term. Based on current office market conditions, our bias is to patiently pursue preleases before going vertical, and we are currently following that strategy with the office asset listed here. We also intend to capitalize this company in a manner that will enable us to pursue all of these projects while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.
On Page 27, we've laid out a summary of the balance of the future development pipeline of this company. At over 17 million square feet, this is the largest treasure trove of growth opportunities you'll find in any company in our market. This pipeline will enable us to double the size of this company through assets entirely under our control today. I want to be clear on something here. We will not be levering this company to go hog-wild on development. We may be new to the public markets, but we are not new to capital allocation and the avoidance of risk. I'll cover that a little more when we talk about the balance sheet but first I want to address Crystal City specifically.
Crystal City is one of the most compelling opportunities in this company's portfolio. Its challenges were tailor-made for our toolkit of deep development expertise, retail experience and our placemaking-driven approach. It has everything going for it, including Metro, critical mass, proximity to key demand drivers, views and great access not to mention, a jurisdiction with great schools and low taxes but it lacks a critical mass of amenities. Its existing amenities are compromised, underground retail with not enough anchor space and it lacks sufficient residential density to be a vibrant 24-hour place. The fix for these deficiencies is exactly the sort of thing we're best at creating and it's the skill set we've perfected throughout our 55-year history. When we've done this elsewhere, it has taken us years to assemble the critical mass to change a neighborhood. With Crystal City, the concentrated ownership is there Day 1. All that it requires is the right plan and sufficient time to implement it. We talked a lot about placemaking and changing neighborhoods and to some, this sounds like renovating dozens of assets and spending billions of dollars. That's not what we're talking about and that is not what Crystal City needs. Any great neighborhood needs a well-executed retail heart.
What we've done on Page 28 is to overlay the size of all of Crystal City on 3 of the most vibrant high-rent districts in our market, one of which we primarily created the Shaw Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest D.C. As you can see here, and zoomed in on Page 29, the heart of these neighborhoods is typically a very -- is typically very small, just a few blocks. This heart has multiple anchors, plenty of services, banks, dry cleaners et cetera, but it also has a carefully curated mix of amenity retail. Local shops, maker shops, streetscape, parking, green space et cetera. It also has enough residential to be a place worth visiting after work hours. If it's truly special it will have 1 or more destination anchors often entertainment-based. The point is that repositioning a large concentration of asset like Crystal City does not require the renovation of the entire place. To the contrary, it only requires the right execution of a relatively small subset of the neighborhood requiring far less capital. Done right, that well-planned heart can drive outside occupancy and rent growth in all of the neighboring uses.
The age of building stock, on Page 28, is included to demonstrate that while all of these submarkets have older building stock than Crystal City, they all rent at a premium because they are great amenitized vibrant places. That's the missing ingredient. We'll have much more detail on our plans for Crystal City down the road, but I want to repeat that it is one of the elements of this new company that we're most excited about.
Now let's talk about capitalization on Page 30. We intend to launch this company with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet with deep capacity to fund future growth without over leveraging the company. In addition to a very manageable debt maturity profile, we will have an appropriately sized credit facility for access to immediate capital and flexibility but our debt financing strategy will not rely on corporate debt. Long-term financing will be done on a nonrecourse basis at the asset level. We will also be aggressive about identifying opportunities to recycle within the portfolio by selling or joint venturing selected assets whose market value exceeds replacement costs and deploying that capital into newer higher growth, internal investments and potential acquisitions.
Finally, on Page 31, a word about our market. Washington's office market has had a rough run for almost a decade. In the office market, our average 5-year net absorption was negative 250,000 square feet versus a 20-year average of positive 3.3 million square feet. Although many private sector players rightsized after sequestration and BRAC, the wreckage in the office market has taken a long time to recover. With much of that tenant rightsizing behind us, and most recently, our best job growth year in a decade, we believe that Washington is poised to grow in the coming years where much of the rest of the country has began to flatten out or even soften. This counter cyclicality is not a typical for our market. We further believe that growth will be concentrated in the places that offer what tenants and consumers want: vibrant retail, services, amenities, walkability and transit.
On the apartment side having the highest median household income in the country and a lower rent share of wallet than other Gateway cities supports much of the strong apartment absorption we've seen in spite of high levels of supply. When for-sale housing is added to the mix, our total housing units have actually been in line with demand. So this outcome has not been surprising. All of these trends lead us to conclude that Washington has a healthy base, from which to grow in the coming years, especially in infill submarkets that offer what tenants demand. As I said before, we look forward to meeting with investors prior to launch to provide a deep dive review of the portfolio and our strategy. We're very excited about this opportunity and we believe this powerhouse of the company will be an incredible platform to deliver strong shareholder value over time.
Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap up."

First of all, it was done very carefully. Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG, in its current state",763,"I'm happy to answer that question. First of all, it was done very carefully. Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG, in its current state, has a EBITDA somewhere in the mid-40s. That's after all expenses or what have you. That's what's come to the bottom line of the current JBG. We are -- our advisers and our exploration into the comps is, is that these companies trade for between 9x and 10x. So If you take a midpoint on that, that means the -- --  let's say, call it, $45 million of EBITDA coming out of JBG would be worth somewhere, $400 million, maybe a little bit higher. And the reason I say maybe a little bit higher is because it's the premier company in its marketplace, and it would probably sell for a premium. So if the JBG partners were to sell this company in its current incarnation, as a going concern, we think the market value of that is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million, step one. Step two is, that's approximately the number or in a range of what we were talking about when we engaged with JBG a couple of years ago, and that's even less than the number that the -- was negotiated in the famous or infamous NYRT transaction. So let's have, say bad  [ph].  So our number was $335 million. That's not in cash. That is in script. And so the value of that, that was -- and what happens is they are going to be getting a percentage of the company in shares, and those shares will fluctuate. So if they fluctuate down -- at what they fluctuate? Whatever. Now we also valued our management company at $80 million. I can tell you that our management company has 0 EBITDA. So the way we looked at it, we paid a -- the Vornado shareholder paid a net $335 million less $80 million or $255 million for the JBG platform. The whole shooting match: the team, all their employees and what have you. Now I've already talked about what the going concern value of JBG was. Let's talk about what the value would be to us. Well, to us, the net was for $255 million. And we've already said that we're going to run off -- we're not going to do any more funds, and we're going to run off of the assets that were excluded. Those assets that are excluded have a fee stream which is pretty substantial, and the discounted value of that is somewhere between $175 million, maybe even up to $200 million, depending upon the discount rate you use. So now we get that our $335 million goes down to $255 million because of the value of our management company and then goes down to -- let's use a number of $175 million, $180 million. So it goes down to $60 million, $70 million is the net cost of this whole platform to us. But that's not the end of the story. By combining the JBG platform and the Vornado existing platform, there are synergies. Those synergies are, we believe, gross $35-ish million, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. And then that doesn't -- if you have to deduct from that the cost of being a separate public company, which we're guesstimating at, call it, somewhere between $12 million, $15 million. So maybe -- Michael is telling he thinks it's less. But let's say -- so maybe we think the net synergies of combining the 2 companies are, pick a number, $20 million to $25 million less than it would be, okay? Well, that has a value and is very favorable compared to the net $60 million, $70 million price of buying this platform. So that's the math, which is you can tell, I think from Mike's fairly detailed remarks, was very carefully analyzed and thought about. Now let's go to the last point. Would you rather own the company with JBG combined, that would be worth less, let's say, $50 million -- it's a $0.25 of Vornado share, $0.25. Would you rather have the combined company with its assets, its opportunities in the future and the leading management platform in the marketplace, even if it cost you a $0.25 or $0.30 to do that? And the answer is, of course you would, okay? So I think, Steve, that's a long-winded answer to your question."

When we make the rounds with a much more deep dive roadshow, we will get into specifics as to what -- projects that are soon to start and how we've made the capital allocation decisions. But generally speaking, we respond to market conditions. As I said earlier, being called a developer I think sometimes is a bad word in this business because there are a lot of folks out there who gotten it wrong, who have done too much, too fast, don't pay attention to supply and demand and overbuild. That has not been our history. That is, I think, one of the primary reasons why we have outperformed and over delivered. And as we think about development, it's primarily rooted on what will add value and strength to the portfolio over time and what is most responsive to market conditions, not just market conditions today, but as we look out 2, 3, 4, 5 years and where we see supply and demand trends going, what will play into those trends and what would be the most valuable assets to own long term."

They -- the land that we -- I don't look at the land as land. I look at it as future buildings, okay? And I look at those future buildings as profit opportunity. So first of all, the locations of all of these opportunities are the best in the Washington region by far. So we have -- first of all, it's big, really big. Second of all, it's in the best submarkets in depth. The third thing is, is that this is an opportunity to create new buildings at outsized returns, which are substantially better than you could buy a similar building in a similar location on a return basis, which means that there is a profit to a big profit in this land as you develop it over time. Now there's a trend going on in the world today. A, new buildings are much more valuable than old buildings. B, there's obsolescence in real estate. So that when you're building a new building, you can make it state of the art, what the customer wants, whether it's an office building or a residential building. And three, the capital, maintenance capital for a new building is like almost 0 for the first 10 years or so as opposed to an older building. So this portfolio of opportunity, we look upon it as opportunity, is one of the things that makes this a unique investment opportunity."

We will be supplementing the team with folks who have deep public market expertise in the areas that you described because it's critical that we get that right. And we will. The first part of your question with respect to flexibility, I think there is a misperception that somehow, you can't be nimble if you're in the public markets or that you can't take advantage of opportunities, perhaps, in the same way you might do in private markets. I just don't buy that. I think good real estate decisions are good real estate decisions, whether you're public or private. And I think one of the things of that we have demonstrated in our history, as we have moved from being a syndicator to a fund manager to a fund manager with lots of joint venture relationships and other things, that in fact, no matter what your capital structure and your legal structure and your ownership structure is, you can still attack and pursue aggressively the best real estate decisions and take advantage of the best opportunities in the market.

But what's been included here is basically a concentration on 2 nodes within the greater Reston submarket. One is the -- at the site of the Wiehle Avenue Metro stop. And that's a mixed-use project, retail-heavy, grocery-anchored, lots of apartments, right in the strike zone of what we do. And then the one you just described, which is the Summit office buildings in Reston Town Center West, RTC West, which some of you may recognize. That was a former Reston Executive Center, which we actually acquired from Vornado. That is not only an existing office building, but you'll see in the presentation, it is also one of the new development projects. That is an asset where we are delivering retail, the RTC West retail on Page 25, it's about 40,000 square feet of ground-floor, small-store retail that is designed to amenitize those buildings. That asset sits right in between Boston properties, Reston Town Center and the exit platform to the new under construction Metro station. And so it is right in the footpath connecting those 2, and that retail, we believe, will be phenomenally successful. It has already been successful in enabling us to lease that building. This is against the backdrop of Northern Virginia suburban office. It's enabled us to lease that building with the retail only roughly half preleased and not yet delivered, to lease that building fully and at rents that exceed where they were when we acquired it by 20%. That's against the backdrop of a market that has been flat and that has, as you heard me articulate earlier, had negative net absorption. And so that is a micro case study of the power of amenities and the power of retail. And that's even before the Metro has shown up."

In fact, above trends from last year. And on average, basically, with kind of 10-year trends. In terms of rents, we have continued to see rents remain stable. I think some of our competitors have said, and I'll echo it, that we've seen moderately increasing concessions. Some of that relates to, in fact, construction cost, so the cost of building space has escalated significantly. So with that, some of the TI packages, in fact, have increased. And then I think most importantly, what I would emphasize is that what we're seeing in New York is a continuing of very, very good diversification of trends in terms of the nature of [indiscernible]. So I'll go back and I'll tell you, back in 1990, as we looked at office sector jobs, 1 out of every 2 office sector jobs at the time was financial services-related. As we look at the city today, that number today is less than 1 out of every 3. So although there's been a lot published about the lack of growth in financial services, in fact, to some extent, a continuing slight loss in financial services jobs, the reality is, as you look at the overall health of the city and the diversification of job growth, I think it's as good as we've ever seen. I also will just reemphasize what I said, and that is we are in a mature recovery. We have seen office sector job come down from the peak that we saw over the 2011 to basically '14, '15 period of time. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still seeing very good office sector job growth, somewhere around 14,000, 15,000 jobs, which translates into about 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of absorption. So continuing trends, I will tell you we are continuing to see pretty good growth."

Whether or not we pursue those is a question mark. We may sell them or recap them. But generally speaking, what has been left out is a fairly low-maintenance basket of assets. A lot of -- the biggest assets are long-term, flat, highly leveraged, fully leased, GSA buildings that will not be going into the company. Those will be sold over time. Those require very little to no actual maintenance, and they do, of course, pay. They will be paying fees for the services we provide to the REIT."

I would try to articulate that in the near-term development pipeline. All of that is ready to go. There is a large proportion of the $17 million that is matter of right, which is to say that it is consistent with underlying zoning. But in many of the jurisdictions in Washington, in order to be able to pull a building permit, you have to do a lot of work and get something closer to the start line. Some of those assets are, some of them are not. We will go through in detail and bucket those things so that investors will have a lot of transparency as to what's in that. On your first question about how we will capitalize assets, we intend to be stingy with the equity of this company. And only when we are trading at what we think are very attractive values, ideally premiums to net asset value, will issuing equity even be considered a possibility for us. When it comes to flexibility and how we finance things, there are a number of assets in this portfolio, that, if we believe we can recycle within the portfolio by selling assets at values that dramatically exceed replacement costs, we will do that and deploy that capital into net new value creation opportunities, in particular where the yields on costs are high. And when we look at yields on costs, we don't look at yield on cost from the standpoint of incremental cost only. We look at yields on costs from the standpoint of what is our land actually worth and what is the yield on cost for the new project inclusive of that land value. Because if that doesn't pencil, then it points more toward simply selling your land. And that's a well-trodden path for us as far as the thought process. When it comes to capital sources, I've talked about project-level leverage, nonrecourse asset-level financing. We also have, by virtue of our third-party capital business, a ton of relationships that we have cultivated over decades of prospective joint venture partners. Many of them will be much happier that we are in a permanent capital structure than in a finite life vehicle. Because many of the best partners out there want a partner who will hang around with them potentially forever if that's the plan and not have an artificial arbitrary exit date imposed upon them by virtue of a fund life. Those partners are folks that can be selectively resources and capital providers, often at times when the REIT markets are not the most efficient source of capital, to fund new opportunities. We will have to weigh that against how much of an asset we want to own, how much of the vig do we want to own in a project versus how much do we want to share with an investment partner. And frankly, are we getting enough out of the deal with that partner to warrant doing that. But that analysis is one that is -- really forms a bedrock of how and when we have decided to do everything that we've done throughout our history. And that won't be changing in this new construct."

With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most import",1393,"Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. With the Washington D.C. news today, I'll be brief in my prepared remarks and happy to take any questions when we get to Q&A.
A few observations on the market in New York. As I've said before, the most important metric we look at are employment numbers, in particular, office using jobs. Private sector employment is up about 80,000 jobs for the trailing 12 months and at 3,773,000 jobs is at an all-time high. Office using employment is also up 14,000 jobs year-over-year and had 1,373,000 jobs, again, it is an all-time high. While this rate of growth for office sector jobs is less than the 35,000 average annual increase over the past 6 years since the recovery kicked in, we are still seeing good office job growth later in the cycle, increasing at a bit over 1% per annum. Most of the brokerage houses have reported modestly increasing space availability levels, both for the quarter and the year-to-date of about 50 basis points. No big deal. Asking rents remain at/or near-record levels and leasing activity for the first 9 months at over 27 million square feet is up about 4% from last year and on par with 10-year averages. What we have seen is a shifting of tenant demand away from commoditized buildings, which are not leasing well to new and updated buildings, which are seeing good activity as tenants seek more modern and efficient space. We anticipated this trend early, having completed 6.5 million square feet of high-quality building repositionings in the last 4 years alone. Our fleet is in great shape.
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. As expected, our occupancy at the end of the third quarter fell slightly by 50 basis points to 95.5%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Customs Service vacating nearly 150,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza for a long planned return to the World Trade Center. We have already leased about 50,000 square feet of that space and have a strong pipeline to fill out the remainder.
For the quarter, we leased 335,000 square feet in 40 transactions at average starting rents of $68.11, representing mark-to-market of 7.1% GAAP and 6.2% cash. About 40% of leasing activity was in Penn Plaza. Let me remind you that this reduced level of activity is a reflection of the fact that during the past 3 years: 2013, '14 and '15, we leased the better part of 9 million square feet handling our major future expirations.
A couple of examples. In 11 Penn Plaza, we entered into long-term renewals with AMC Network and Macy's for an aggregate of 975,000 square feet. At Two Penn Plaza, we renewed MSG for 325,000 square feet. And where we knew we would have space coming back to us, we completed headquarters leases with Neuberger Berman for over 400,000 square feet in 1290 Sixth Avenue and with Amazon for 470,000 square feet at 7 West 34th Street, all space that was otherwise coming back to us in the 2017, 2018 period of time. We remain basically full and our expirations are modest with just 113,000 square feet of leases expiring for the balance of this year and only 600,000 square feet in all of 2017, with no one tenant representing more than 75,000 square feet. We have a robust pipeline including more than 560,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and another 700,000 square feet in active discussions.
Last month, a joint venture of Vornado and the related companies, a natural marriage teaming up the largest owners in Penn Plaza and Hudson Yards, was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic McKim, Mead & White-designed Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan train hall serving Long Island Railroad and Amtrak passengers, which will be constructed by Skanska. As Governor Cuomo described last month, the great -- the train hall will be a grand civic space at 250,000 square feet, larger than the main hall at Grand Central, the train hall will increase the floor space for the commuting public by over 50%. Over 90 feet above the main train passenger level there'll be a grand skylight supported by historic trusses to allow light to stream into the train hall. The Vornado-related joint venture will acquire approximately 850,000 rentable square feet in the building to be developed into creative office space and ancillary train hall retail for an upfront payment of $230 million. The Farley building adds to our growing portfolio of new office developments on the Westside, including 61 Ninth, 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh and 85 Tenth Avenue. The interior of the original Farley building, a postal facility, was built as a warehouse with great 17-plus foot floor-to-floor ceiling heights and floor place averaging over 200,000 rentable square feet. It has the same spectacular bones as our 770 Broadway here in New York and theMART in Chicago, both of which have proven to be best-in-class creative space for a creative office class tenants such as Facebook and Google. We are confident that this building also will contribute to the ongoing repositioning of our Penn Plaza portfolio as a hub for high-quality TAMI tenants seeking to locate via the most important transportation hub in New York. Governor Cuomo and his team deserve enormous credit for advancing this important project. We are proud to have been designated and look forward to working with the state and the railroads to deliver the governor's vision of a grand gateway to New York City.
Turning now to our premier street retail portfolio. During the third quarter, we leased 7,500 square feet with strong positive mark-to-market's of 69.2% GAAP and 53.4% cash. Occupancy ticked up 180 basis points to 96.7%. Ed Hogan, who runs our retail leasing machine in New York, would tell you that over the last couple of months, we have seen retail leasing activity increase with the entry of some new tenants into the market and interest from cosmetics tenants, intimate apparel and food retailers.
As Steve mentioned, we invite you to visit our 640 Fifth Avenue property, where just last week, Victoria's Secret opened their 4 levels stunning new 64,000-square-foot flagship store. To enable to Victoria's Secret to complete its fit out and open for the important holiday season, we completely restacked and repositioned the former H&M space in record time working 3 shifts a day and delivering the space to Victoria's Secret in February.
At the adjacent 3,000-square-foot store with 25 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, Nespresso last week opened a pop-up store for the holiday season, and we have a long-term lease out for the space with a tenant, which will open its first flagship retail store in New York.
At theMART in Chicago, same-store numbers for the third quarter were a very strong positive 12.4% GAAP and 5.5% cash. Great tenants continue to be attracted to the innovation-focused space at theMART, and we're proud of the quality of the 2 tenants we added in the third quarter, Kellogg and Caterpillar. Adding these household names to an already blue-chip roster continues to reinforce the preeminence of this unique asset. We leased 20,000 square feet of office space, at average starting rents of $47.46, representing mark-to-market's of 58.2% cash. These leases brought our occupancy up by 40 basis points to 98.2%.
In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street, we leased 72,000 square feet this quarter, including a 54,000-square-foot renewal lease with McKinsey & Company. With average starting rents of around $90 per square feet, we believe the building's position as the premier office building in San Francisco is clear. Our amenity-rich redevelopment of the  concourse level should be completed around year-end, and we're also making very good progress with potential tenants for the former Bank of America banking hall that we call the Cube.
Overall, for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with a same-store increase of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash or an even stronger 6.5% cap and 11.7% cash, excluding The Hotel Pennsylvania, which really tells a truer history. The hotel business in New York continues to feel the impact of oversupply in the market on both occupancy and pricing.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Theriot."

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136",688,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.35 per share as compared to $1.05 per share for the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 included net gains on sale of real estate of $136.2 million or $0.72 per share. After adjusting for net gains and other items that affect comparability in both periods, adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter is $0.39 or $0.02 above the prior year's third quarter.
FFO, as adjusted, which we formerly called comparable FFO, was $1.24 per share for the third quarter or $0.03 above the prior year's third quarter. See Page 39 of our Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of FFO and FFO as adjusted.
Our Fed ratio exceeded 100% in the first and second quarters and is 95.5% for the third quarter. Our Fed ratio will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as a result of the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity in the last 2 years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our fed ratio will return to its normal loss level in the mid-80s by the end of 2017.
As David noted, our New York business had a strong quarter with same-store increases of 4.9% GAAP and 9.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, it is an even stronger 6.5% GAAP and 11.7% cash.
On to our Washington business. As noted on Page 48 of our Form 10-Q, we reaffirmed our guidance for our New York business for the full year 2016, I'm sorry, Washington -- our Washington business for the full 2016. Within that guidance, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance for core operations of flat to up $4 million. The leasing pace at the Bartlett is running at an incredible 60 units per month. Since we opened the rental office in June of this year, we have leased over 65% of the units of this 699 unit project, a big testament to the quality of the development and the competitiveness of the product. We have leased 455 units and the rental office just opened 5 months ago -- just incredible. We leased 177,000 square feet of office space in Washington, excluding Skyline, with mark-to-markets of negative 4.8% GAAP and negative 10.3% cash. Quarter end occupancy of the Washington portfolio, excluding Skyline, was 91.1%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter.
Now to capital markets activity in the quarter. We completed a 5-year, $675 million refinancing of theMART at a 2.7% fixed rate. This loan replaces the 5.75% $555 million mortgage that was scheduled to mature in December. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% series J preferred shares at par or 400 -- $246.3 million in the aggregate, which will result in savings of $17 million or $0.08 per share per year. We have virtually no remaining consolidated debt maturities in 2016 and our 2017 maturities are $360 million. Our share of partially owned entities debt maturities is $33 million for the remainder of 2016 and $89 million for 2017.
Excluding Skyline and the financing for our 220 Central Park South project, which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.81% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years; and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years.
Debt-to-enterprise value was 26%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.5x, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys ""R"" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.4x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.
I will now turn the call back to Steve."

From here on, my remarks followed by Michael and Matt will focus on Washington and the spin of this transaction. A few years ago, in response to a chronically undervalued stock price and, admittedly, too complex and diffused collection of assets and businesses, we began a program to simplify and focus the company, all with an objective of daylighting our treasure trove of assets and creating value. As I said at that time, everything was on the table and that we would leave no stone unturned. We have since exited business lines and none core investments, gotten out of the mall business, sold-out of the showroom business, retaining, of course, the giant 3.7 million square foot Chicago Mart building. We spun off our shopping center business into Urban Edge Properties. All told, this activity totaled $9.1 billion. Of course, along the way, we acquired and developed assets into our core, all the while upgrading the mix and quality of our portfolio.
Last evening, we announced another major milestone. The spinning off of our Washington, D.C. business and simultaneous merger with The JBG Companies and what is known in the trade as a tax-free spin merge transaction or technically, a  Reverse Morris Trust. A little history here: we acquired our Washington business in 2002 at the right time in the cycle and at a great price. We have since built it through acquisition and development to be the largest owner in the region. In 2011, we suffered a double whammy when the Department of Defense and related contractors began vacating what would total 2.5 million square feet under the BRAC statute just as the Washington office market was softening. At the nadir, we suffered a $70 million hit to annual income. Even though our flagship New York business powered through and its growth well exceeded the hit from Washington, our stock price has suffered. What to do? For various reasons, selling the Washington business was not an option, nor did we want to sell it at the bottom. Some would say that by not selling, we are actually buying and that's sort of true. We do like the Washington market place, and we do like our assets in Washington, especially at that price. So no sell but we did believe the best strategy was to separate Washington and New York for reasons that I will speak about in a minute. The tax-free spin-off was the perfect solution. Spinning our Washington business as-is would have been just an okay execution but combining it with the market leader, JBG, would be a blockbuster. At that point, we initiated an approach to JBG and began a courtship.
3 things happened: one, we got to know each other very well; two, the JBG gang began to appreciate that the permanent capital and scale of the public company format maybe an even better business model than their private fund model; and three, I decided at that time not to proceed. I simply couldn't get comfortable with serving 2 masters, their private limited partners and our public shareholders. This time around, we have it exactly correct. There will be no new funds and the existing funds will run off. We all, management, the board and shareholders will all worship at the altar of stock price, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
JBG having caught the bug pursued an IPO, pursued a merger with several other already public candidates and finally made a deal with NYRT, which I believe everyone on the call is probably familiar with. Maybe the JBG guys stubbed their toes on the NYRT deal, maybe not, whatever. There were lessons learned there and these guys are very fast learners. But I can assure you that the JBG team are great real estaters and great moneymakers and after all, that's what I'm after. I cannot emphasize enough the capability of the 150 person JBG team. This is the real price in this deal. Key business terms and important information regarding our JBG SMITH transaction are available in the press release and investor presentation on our website at www.vno.com. A couple of points before Michael takes you through the investor deck. Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the combined company. JBG limited partners are expected to own approximately 20% and JB [sic] [ JBG ] management is expected to own approximately 6%, all of those percentages being subject to closing adjustments. The combined company will be led by JBG's senior management team. Critically, management's interest will be perfectly aligned with shareholders' interest. They will be huge equity holders of restricted stock and units with appropriate vesting and lock-up periods. Management will certainly be eating its own cooking. We very carefully selected, which JBG assets would be included, always with an eye towards future growth. Valuations were determined fairly and absolutely symmetrically.
JBG SMITH Board of Trustees will consist of 12 members, a majority of whom will be independent. Vornado and JBG will each designate 6 trustees. I will be Chairman of the Board. Matt Kelly will be Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. We expect to file our Form-10 in December, and we expect to complete the distribution and combination in the second quarter of 2017. Vornado's board has already approved the transaction and JBG's investors have consented. This is a great deal for Vornado. This is a great deal for Vornado and its shareholders. It was very carefully constructed. It is transformative and it accomplishes many of our most important goals. It creates 2 highly focused pure plays each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card. And each of the 2 will be the largest and the leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York or Washington or both as they choose, no bundling here.
The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than 4 times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York's treasured trove of assets and superior financial performance. Importantly, it is the big fix for Washington. JBG SMITH will be the market leading powerhouse with unrivaled portfolio of substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG SMITH has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the country and the math works. At its simplest, pure-play New York, unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better. And Washington with JBG management has to perform and trade much better. I'll say it again. At its simplest, pure New York unburdened by Washington, has to trade much better, and Washington, with JBG management, has to perform and trade much better. Simply stated, that's why this is a great deal.
Now I'll turn it over to Michael who will take you through the investor presentation."

Turning now to the slide deck we posted on our website last night. There's a lot of detail in there. We won't review all of it on this call, but I'm going to take you through the highlights. Starting on Page 1.
I want to start by reiterating that this transaction is a continuation of the strategy Vornado began several years ago to simplify and focus our business. When all is said and done, we will have driven significant shareholder value by creating 3 best-in-class, pure-play, publicly traded REITs. Urban Edge with its growth-oriented focus and portfolio of retail assets and high barrier centers, a highly focused New York City-centric Vornado with premier office assets and the only publicly investable, high street retail portfolio of significant scale and JBG SMITH, which will be the largest, pure-play and soon-to-be powerhouse Washington, D.C. real estate company.
Page 2 provides an overview of the transaction. Vornado is spinning off its Washington, D.C. business and JBG is merging in its operating company and a portfolio of selected assets. It's a marriage of the 2 largest and most well-respected real estate organization from the D.C. market, the product of which will be the market-leading pure-play D.C. real estate company. The combined transaction value is $8.4 billion. Much likely to set up Urban Edge, JBG SMITH will be well-capitalized with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet designed to execute on its business plan. As Steve said earlier, Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74%, JBG's current limited partners, approximately 20% and JBG management, approximately 6%. We'll talk more about how we derived these percentages in a moment.
And as we'll review shortly, we've taken steps to totally align the interest of JBG SMITH management and its shareholders. In addition, while this deal was motivated by strategic considerations about the opportunities in Washington, D.C. there will be significant cost synergies totaling about $35 million before accounting for public company costs from combining complementary portfolios and platforms. Creating an overhead cost structure inline with best-in-class peers. As for Vornado RemainCo, it will be the premier, pure-play New York city real estate company. We expect to be aggregate of Vornado RemainCo and JBG SMITH dividends will be at least equal to Vornado's current dividend. Finally, we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Page 3 shows you the statistics and makeup of the combined portfolio from this transaction. The asset quality and our urban infill concentration of the 79 asset operating portfolio and almost 20 million-square-foot development pipeline will stand head and shoulders above its competitors. The combined portfolio is diversified in terms of property asset classes and also geographies in the Metro D.C. region, where we'll have a significant presence in the best submarkets: Downtown D.C, Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, Reston and Bethesda. JBG SMITH will be in an excellent position to drive outsized returns and value over time with its unmatched portfolio.
Steve covered the strategic rationale for the transaction at the outset, so let's move to Page 5. This page provides an overview of the thought and strategy that went into selecting the JBG assets to merge with the Vornado/Charles E. Smith portfolio and position the combined company for outsized growth. We strategically selected the best assets from the larger JBG pool of assets to complement the Vornado D.C. portfolio. Our objective was to create a combined portfolio with the unique profile by selecting strategic, high quality assets, both operating and land, with high-growth potential that reinforce key attributes, including: one, critical mass in core and Metro-served markets; two, concentrations in complementary submarkets, particularly in mixed-use environments; three, it enhanced diversification; and four, strong value-add opportunities. And we deliberately excluded assets that did not fit these objectives such as those in non-Metro-served areas, highly leveraged GSA-leased buildings, near-term sale candidates and hotels, condominiums and townhouses. These assets will be sold as part of the natural wind down of legacy JBG funds.
Now let's move to the methodology we used to value the assets to be merged and the resulting ownership levels, which are the subject of Page 6. We rigorously underwrote and reviewed comps on each other's assets to arrive at fair market values for each side. As Steve said, asset pricing was done fairly and symmetrically with the net result being an implied weighted average cap rate of 5.1% on each sides operating assets. For the nonoperating assets, including under construction, development and land assets, we used a consistent return on cost and per pound methodology. Finally, to arrive at a value for each management company, we used a combination of valuation approaches, including multiples on precedent transactions and DCF analysis. The result is that Vornado's management company is being contributed at $80 million and JBG's companies being contributed at $335 million. A reflection of the fact that JBG generates 4 to 5 times more in third-party fees than Vornado D.C.'s management company. The bottom line is that Vornado shareholders are expected to own approximately 74% of the new company and JBG's management and LPs will own 26%.
Moving on to Page 7. It was critical to us that the transaction ensured total alignment of management interests with those of JBG SMITH shareholders. As Steve mentioned earlier, JBG SMITH will not raise new private investment funds. The JBG legacy funds are fully invested, no longer in acquisition mode and will be wound down. The only thing that matters is the shareholders. Importantly, the vast majority of the management team's net worth will be tied up in JBG SMITH stock. JBG management own approximately 6% of the combined company, putting it in the top decile of the companies. Of the JBG management company shares, 50% will vest immediately and be locked up for 3 years and 50% will vest over month's 31 to 60 and be locked up until the end of the fifth year. The management team will not receive promotes on contributed assets but will continue receiving promotes they're entitled to on legacy fund assets as the funds are wound down.
Finally, we are also instituting a $100 million formation equity grant award for a broad group of JBG SMITH employees that is entirely performance-based to align interest deeper into the organization. To be clear, this award only becomes in the money if the stock goes up and is only worth $100 million if the stock doubles.
Let me move on to process and timing on Page 8. We expect to file the Form 10 by the end of this year. We'll complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of customary third-party consents in Hart–Scott–Rodino. There's no shareholder vote required on the Vornado side and JBG has already received all their investor approvals for the transaction, so closing is just a matter of time. The pro rata distribution ratio for Vornado shareholders will be 1:2, so investors will receive 1 share of JBG SMITH for every 2 shares of Vornado stock they own. Vornado will provide interim support services in areas such as IT, tax and SEC reporting pursuant to a transition services agreement.
Before turning over it to Matt, to discuss the prospects for JBG SMITH, let's first take a quick look at the post-spin Vornado. Pages 9 through 17 cover Vornado RemainCo, which is really the main event. With the separation of D.C, Vornado RemainCo will be the premier pure-play New York City REIT with a portfolio of irreplaceable, best-in-class office and high street retail assets in one of the best markets in the world and one where we're a clear leader. Upon completion of this transaction, 99% of our EBITDA, will come from our core New York real estate segment, including theMART and the 555 California. New York City, will itself account for 88% of our EBITDA after the spin-off, up from 70% today. All-in-all, it's a world-class business. Having divested noncore assets and now with this latest step, we hope investors will be better able to appreciate what a powerhouse our New York business is. We don't have time to cover every page in this section but the images and financial figures clearly demonstrate what a unique collection of assets we have, one we've spent years curating and which cannot be replicated. In addition, the figure shows the impressive growth our New York business has historically delivered both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. The metrics are industry-leading.
So to sum up, as a New York City focused pure-play with a fortress balance sheet, attractive growth opportunities and a deep and experienced management team with a proven track record, Vornado will be well-positioned to further enhance shareholder value.
Now let me turn the floor over to Matt Kelly to walk you through JBG SMITH Properties."

I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. m",2203,"Thanks, Michael and Steve, and thanks to you, all, for joining the call. I'm Matt Kelly, and I'll be the CEO of JBG SMITH Properties.
For those who don't know us, JBG is a vertically integrated operating platform that is focused exclusively on the D.C. market for over 5 decades. We're known for our creative dealmaking and capital allocation skills and for our deep bench of development and value-creation expertise across product types. While our D.C. market experience and office, residential and retail is unrivaled, we have been trendsetters in our market by mixing uses and projects that deliver the amenities and features that tenants demand. Concentrating in passive growth locations with Metro access and deep retail potential have been key drivers of our success. We've been the most active player in the Washington market, and we are the definition of a local sharpshooter. We know our market block by block and see virtually every opportunity in the market.
Since 2000, we have acquired over 19 million square feet and have developed almost 18 million square feet of cross-sell product types. Our team has worked together for an average of 20 years and our leadership spans multiple generations. We have delivered top tier results for our investors with a leveraged ROR of over 23% on $3.7 billion of equity deployed in over 250 investments across 9 discretionary funds. None of our funds have lost money even those that we initiated at the high point of the last cycle.
As shown on Page 20, the JBG team will form the senior-most leadership of this combined company. Most of us have spent our entire careers at JBG and have worked together managing capital on behalf of some of the best-known university endowments and foundations in the world.
Before closing, we will hire a CFO from outside the company with a focus on public market experience. In addition to the JBG team, Mitchell Schear will join our executive committee, and Jim Creedon, Patrick Tyrrell and Laurie Kramer of Vornado will serve in key EVP positions in the new company. As we combine the operating teams of both companies, we will be focused on efficiency, minimizing risk and combining the best from 2 great teams. The Washington Post rated JBG the #1 ranked large company to work for in our market across all industries and we intend for JBG SMITH to continue in that tradition of first class management and execution. Our team will have strong alignment with investors. We will own roughly 6% of the new company and our investment will represent the vast majority of the net worth of this team.
Let's move to Page 21 and talk about the combined company and why we're so excited about this opportunity. JBG SMITH will be the largest player in our market with some of the best existing assets and a market-leading development pipeline. We will be a powerhouse of a company with unmatched scale and access to growth opportunities. Our proven track record of delivering on mixed-use value creation and infill locations could not be a better match for an opportunity like Crystal City. What many have seen as a challenged office portfolio in a tough market, we see as an opportunity to pick off low-hanging fruit and position Crystal City as a vibrant amenity-rich destination within Washington. Combine this with the best-in-class balance sheet and the momentum of recovery in our market and we couldn't be more excited to get to work executing our vision for this new company.
Before I move on to the highlights of the company and the portfolio, a word about process. What I cover today will be high level. Prior to launch, we will follow-up with a deep dive roadshow to give investors much more granular information and an opportunity to meet us face-to-face. As you can see on Page 22, including assets under construction and near term starts, JBG SMITH will own 14 million square feet of commercial space and almost 6,000 apartment units making us the market-leading player in Washington with some of the best assets in the market.
On Page 23, you'll see that combining our portfolios comes with minimal overlap and creates an ownership profile concentrated in the complementary collection of the most sought after submarkets in the area. Over 98% of the portfolio is within half a mile of a planned or existing Metro station. These assets, existing construction and future development have taken years.  In some cases, well over a decade to assemble, entitle, design and execute. No other player in our market has access to a growth pipeline like this. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of execution, we believe we can turn that into strong income growth and value creation.
Before we talk about future opportunities, I'll spend a minute on the existing portfolio and development assets that have recently delivered or commenced construction, which is summarized on Page 24. The combined portfolio has free rent burn-off and signed but not yet commenced leases totaling 590,000 square feet of occupancy. The combined company has 5 recently delivered apartment buildings totaling over 1,400 units at our share with average occupancy of 72% as of September 30. All 5 are on top of or next to a brand-new or planned grocery store and many have additional adjacent small stores. All are Metro-served and benefit from a rich base of amenities.
As you can see on Page 25, we have 4 trophy quality assets currently under construction totaling over 820,000 square feet. Three of these are commercial assets, including CEB Tower in Rosslyn and retail projects adjacent to Reston Town Center and Bethesda row. these assets are 63% preleased with most of the balance of the leased-up consisting of 8 of the top 10 floors of CEB Tower, arguably the best building in the submarket with unobstructive views of the D.C. Mall and monumental core.
The fourth asset is a trophy apartment building facing the main entrance to National's Park that will sit amidst a new retail heavy entertainment district between the stadium and the Navy Yard Metro Station. All of these projects are fully capitalized.
Pages 26 and 27 cover our development pipeline, which includes a range of projects in various states of readiness for construction. Our near-term pipeline consists of 7 projects, of which 5 are mixed-use and 2 are standalone CBD trophy office buildings. By value and scale, roughly half our office and the balance, multifamily and retail. All of these projects are entitled, designed and substantially ready to commence construction. We expect that most, if not all of the retail and apartment projects will proceed in the short term. Based on current office market conditions, our bias is to patiently pursue preleases before going vertical, and we are currently following that strategy with the office asset listed here. We also intend to capitalize this company in a manner that will enable us to pursue all of these projects while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.
On Page 27, we've laid out a summary of the balance of the future development pipeline of this company. At over 17 million square feet, this is the largest treasure trove of growth opportunities you'll find in any company in our market. This pipeline will enable us to double the size of this company through assets entirely under our control today. I want to be clear on something here. We will not be levering this company to go hog-wild on development. We may be new to the public markets, but we are not new to capital allocation and the avoidance of risk. I'll cover that a little more when we talk about the balance sheet but first I want to address Crystal City specifically.
Crystal City is one of the most compelling opportunities in this company's portfolio. Its challenges were tailor-made for our toolkit of deep development expertise, retail experience and our placemaking-driven approach. It has everything going for it, including Metro, critical mass, proximity to key demand drivers, views and great access not to mention, a jurisdiction with great schools and low taxes but it lacks a critical mass of amenities. Its existing amenities are compromised, underground retail with not enough anchor space and it lacks sufficient residential density to be a vibrant 24-hour place. The fix for these deficiencies is exactly the sort of thing we're best at creating and it's the skill set we've perfected throughout our 55-year history. When we've done this elsewhere, it has taken us years to assemble the critical mass to change a neighborhood. With Crystal City, the concentrated ownership is there Day 1. All that it requires is the right plan and sufficient time to implement it. We talked a lot about placemaking and changing neighborhoods and to some, this sounds like renovating dozens of assets and spending billions of dollars. That's not what we're talking about and that is not what Crystal City needs. Any great neighborhood needs a well-executed retail heart.
What we've done on Page 28 is to overlay the size of all of Crystal City on 3 of the most vibrant high-rent districts in our market, one of which we primarily created the Shaw Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest D.C. As you can see here, and zoomed in on Page 29, the heart of these neighborhoods is typically a very -- is typically very small, just a few blocks. This heart has multiple anchors, plenty of services, banks, dry cleaners et cetera, but it also has a carefully curated mix of amenity retail. Local shops, maker shops, streetscape, parking, green space et cetera. It also has enough residential to be a place worth visiting after work hours. If it's truly special it will have 1 or more destination anchors often entertainment-based. The point is that repositioning a large concentration of asset like Crystal City does not require the renovation of the entire place. To the contrary, it only requires the right execution of a relatively small subset of the neighborhood requiring far less capital. Done right, that well-planned heart can drive outside occupancy and rent growth in all of the neighboring uses.
The age of building stock, on Page 28, is included to demonstrate that while all of these submarkets have older building stock than Crystal City, they all rent at a premium because they are great amenitized vibrant places. That's the missing ingredient. We'll have much more detail on our plans for Crystal City down the road, but I want to repeat that it is one of the elements of this new company that we're most excited about.
Now let's talk about capitalization on Page 30. We intend to launch this company with substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet with deep capacity to fund future growth without over leveraging the company. In addition to a very manageable debt maturity profile, we will have an appropriately sized credit facility for access to immediate capital and flexibility but our debt financing strategy will not rely on corporate debt. Long-term financing will be done on a nonrecourse basis at the asset level. We will also be aggressive about identifying opportunities to recycle within the portfolio by selling or joint venturing selected assets whose market value exceeds replacement costs and deploying that capital into newer higher growth, internal investments and potential acquisitions.
Finally, on Page 31, a word about our market. Washington's office market has had a rough run for almost a decade. In the office market, our average 5-year net absorption was negative 250,000 square feet versus a 20-year average of positive 3.3 million square feet. Although many private sector players rightsized after sequestration and BRAC, the wreckage in the office market has taken a long time to recover. With much of that tenant rightsizing behind us, and most recently, our best job growth year in a decade, we believe that Washington is poised to grow in the coming years where much of the rest of the country has began to flatten out or even soften. This counter cyclicality is not a typical for our market. We further believe that growth will be concentrated in the places that offer what tenants and consumers want: vibrant retail, services, amenities, walkability and transit.
On the apartment side having the highest median household income in the country and a lower rent share of wallet than other Gateway cities supports much of the strong apartment absorption we've seen in spite of high levels of supply. When for-sale housing is added to the mix, our total housing units have actually been in line with demand. So this outcome has not been surprising. All of these trends lead us to conclude that Washington has a healthy base, from which to grow in the coming years, especially in infill submarkets that offer what tenants demand. As I said before, we look forward to meeting with investors prior to launch to provide a deep dive review of the portfolio and our strategy. We're very excited about this opportunity and we believe this powerhouse of the company will be an incredible platform to deliver strong shareholder value over time.
Now I will turn it back to Steve to wrap up."

Number two, just like we did with Urban Edge and as we always do, we will set forth our program for execution of development and whatever, and the company will be capitalized at the get-go with cash balances and revolving credit lines and et cetera, some -- and some unencumbered assets as well, so that it will be able to aggressively execute on its business plan. Number three, in the early years, the company will not seek an investment-grade rating. It will be -- it will finance at the project level with nonrecourse debt. And so basically, that's the plan."

Second, basically, we had advisers on this transaction, and we pursued in depth what the comps were and what the values were and what the market was. So JBG, in its current state, has a EBITDA somewhere in the mid-40s. That's after all expenses or what have you. That's what's come to the bottom line of the current JBG. We are -- our advisers and our exploration into the comps is, is that these companies trade for between 9x and 10x. So If you take a midpoint on that, that means the -- --  let's say, call it, $45 million of EBITDA coming out of JBG would be worth somewhere, $400 million, maybe a little bit higher. And the reason I say maybe a little bit higher is because it's the premier company in its marketplace, and it would probably sell for a premium. So if the JBG partners were to sell this company in its current incarnation, as a going concern, we think the market value of that is somewhere between $400 million and $450 million, step one. Step two is, that's approximately the number or in a range of what we were talking about when we engaged with JBG a couple of years ago, and that's even less than the number that the -- was negotiated in the famous or infamous NYRT transaction. So let's have, say bad  [ph].  So our number was $335 million. That's not in cash. That is in script. And so the value of that, that was -- and what happens is they are going to be getting a percentage of the company in shares, and those shares will fluctuate. So if they fluctuate down -- at what they fluctuate? Whatever. Now we also valued our management company at $80 million. I can tell you that our management company has 0 EBITDA. So the way we looked at it, we paid a -- the Vornado shareholder paid a net $335 million less $80 million or $255 million for the JBG platform. The whole shooting match: the team, all their employees and what have you. Now I've already talked about what the going concern value of JBG was. Let's talk about what the value would be to us. Well, to us, the net was for $255 million. And we've already said that we're going to run off -- we're not going to do any more funds, and we're going to run off of the assets that were excluded. Those assets that are excluded have a fee stream which is pretty substantial, and the discounted value of that is somewhere between $175 million, maybe even up to $200 million, depending upon the discount rate you use. So now we get that our $335 million goes down to $255 million because of the value of our management company and then goes down to -- let's use a number of $175 million, $180 million. So it goes down to $60 million, $70 million is the net cost of this whole platform to us. But that's not the end of the story. By combining the JBG platform and the Vornado existing platform, there are synergies. Those synergies are, we believe, gross $35-ish million, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. And then that doesn't -- if you have to deduct from that the cost of being a separate public company, which we're guesstimating at, call it, somewhere between $12 million, $15 million. So maybe -- Michael is telling he thinks it's less. But let's say -- so maybe we think the net synergies of combining the 2 companies are, pick a number, $20 million to $25 million less than it would be, okay? Well, that has a value and is very favorable compared to the net $60 million, $70 million price of buying this platform. So that's the math, which is you can tell, I think from Mike's fairly detailed remarks, was very carefully analyzed and thought about. Now let's go to the last point. Would you rather own the company with JBG combined, that would be worth less, let's say, $50 million -- it's a $0.25 of Vornado share, $0.25. Would you rather have the combined company with its assets, its opportunities in the future and the leading management platform in the marketplace, even if it cost you a $0.25 or $0.30 to do that? And the answer is, of course you would, okay? So I think, Steve, that's a long-winded answer to your question."

When we make the rounds with a much more deep dive roadshow, we will get into specifics as to what -- projects that are soon to start and how we've made the capital allocation decisions. But generally speaking, we respond to market conditions. As I said earlier, being called a developer I think sometimes is a bad word in this business because there are a lot of folks out there who gotten it wrong, who have done too much, too fast, don't pay attention to supply and demand and overbuild. That has not been our history. That is, I think, one of the primary reasons why we have outperformed and over delivered. And as we think about development, it's primarily rooted on what will add value and strength to the portfolio over time and what is most responsive to market conditions, not just market conditions today, but as we look out 2, 3, 4, 5 years and where we see supply and demand trends going, what will play into those trends and what would be the most valuable assets to own long term."

They -- the land that we -- I don't look at the land as land. I look at it as future buildings, okay? And I look at those future buildings as profit opportunity. So first of all, the locations of all of these opportunities are the best in the Washington region by far. So we have -- first of all, it's big, really big. Second of all, it's in the best submarkets in depth. The third thing is, is that this is an opportunity to create new buildings at outsized returns, which are substantially better than you could buy a similar building in a similar location on a return basis, which means that there is a profit to a big profit in this land as you develop it over time. Now there's a trend going on in the world today. A, new buildings are much more valuable than old buildings. B, there's obsolescence in real estate. So that when you're building a new building, you can make it state of the art, what the customer wants, whether it's an office building or a residential building. And three, the capital, maintenance capital for a new building is like almost 0 for the first 10 years or so as opposed to an older building. So this portfolio of opportunity, we look upon it as opportunity, is one of the things that makes this a unique investment opportunity."

We will be supplementing the team with folks who have deep public market expertise in the areas that you described because it's critical that we get that right. And we will. The first part of your question with respect to flexibility, I think there is a misperception that somehow, you can't be nimble if you're in the public markets or that you can't take advantage of opportunities, perhaps, in the same way you might do in private markets. I just don't buy that. I think good real estate decisions are good real estate decisions, whether you're public or private. And I think one of the things of that we have demonstrated in our history, as we have moved from being a syndicator to a fund manager to a fund manager with lots of joint venture relationships and other things, that in fact, no matter what your capital structure and your legal structure and your ownership structure is, you can still attack and pursue aggressively the best real estate decisions and take advantage of the best opportunities in the market.

And delivering new and different uses to Crystal City, retail and residential, in particular, that will turn it into a different place that we believe will actually have as big an impact with respect to the value and the income potential of those new deliveries, as it will on the existing inventory of office supply in that submarket."

But the reality is this is 1 page reflected in an intensive 60-day effort on both sides. I think, frankly, to settle on one number is -- almost does a disservice to the process. The reality is that, that is the by-product of all the work product. And we had a downtown portfolio that's better than JBG's and it's a lower cap rate than that; and Crystal City is more capital-intensive, it's higher. So it just so happened, coincidentally, that's where it came out. And I really mean that. You have a buildup of what your assets go in. Obviously, we'd spent a lot of time crafting which assets we pulled in because we want this company built for success, but it's somewhat coincidental that they end up with the same number. The methodology was consistent in terms of district-to-district and submarket-to-submarket, and it just so happened to end up there. I think we probably have a little more capital intensity on our assets, given Crystal City, than JBG does. And so therefore, they probably have a bit more embedded growth on the other assets. But look, I think the bottomline is you're dealing with 2 parties that are highly sophisticated, that are tough negotiators. We've both been successful for our investors investing. And you would expect, when you get 2 groups like that together, that there's going to be a fierce analysis done on both sides to get to our right place. And that's where we ended up."

But what's been included here is basically a concentration on 2 nodes within the greater Reston submarket. One is the -- at the site of the Wiehle Avenue Metro stop. And that's a mixed-use project, retail-heavy, grocery-anchored, lots of apartments, right in the strike zone of what we do. And then the one you just described, which is the Summit office buildings in Reston Town Center West, RTC West, which some of you may recognize. That was a former Reston Executive Center, which we actually acquired from Vornado. That is not only an existing office building, but you'll see in the presentation, it is also one of the new development projects. That is an asset where we are delivering retail, the RTC West retail on Page 25, it's about 40,000 square feet of ground-floor, small-store retail that is designed to amenitize those buildings. That asset sits right in between Boston properties, Reston Town Center and the exit platform to the new under construction Metro station. And so it is right in the footpath connecting those 2, and that retail, we believe, will be phenomenally successful. It has already been successful in enabling us to lease that building. This is against the backdrop of Northern Virginia suburban office. It's enabled us to lease that building with the retail only roughly half preleased and not yet delivered, to lease that building fully and at rents that exceed where they were when we acquired it by 20%. That's against the backdrop of a market that has been flat and that has, as you heard me articulate earlier, had negative net absorption. And so that is a micro case study of the power of amenities and the power of retail. And that's even before the Metro has shown up."

In fact, above trends from last year. And on average, basically, with kind of 10-year trends. In terms of rents, we have continued to see rents remain stable. I think some of our competitors have said, and I'll echo it, that we've seen moderately increasing concessions. Some of that relates to, in fact, construction cost, so the cost of building space has escalated significantly. So with that, some of the TI packages, in fact, have increased. And then I think most importantly, what I would emphasize is that what we're seeing in New York is a continuing of very, very good diversification of trends in terms of the nature of [indiscernible]. So I'll go back and I'll tell you, back in 1990, as we looked at office sector jobs, 1 out of every 2 office sector jobs at the time was financial services-related. As we look at the city today, that number today is less than 1 out of every 3. So although there's been a lot published about the lack of growth in financial services, in fact, to some extent, a continuing slight loss in financial services jobs, the reality is, as you look at the overall health of the city and the diversification of job growth, I think it's as good as we've ever seen. I also will just reemphasize what I said, and that is we are in a mature recovery. We have seen office sector job come down from the peak that we saw over the 2011 to basically '14, '15 period of time. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still seeing very good office sector job growth, somewhere around 14,000, 15,000 jobs, which translates into about 2 million, 2.5 million square feet of absorption. So continuing trends, I will tell you we are continuing to see pretty good growth."

I would try to articulate that in the near-term development pipeline. All of that is ready to go. There is a large proportion of the $17 million that is matter of right, which is to say that it is consistent with underlying zoning. But in many of the jurisdictions in Washington, in order to be able to pull a building permit, you have to do a lot of work and get something closer to the start line. Some of those assets are, some of them are not. We will go through in detail and bucket those things so that investors will have a lot of transparency as to what's in that. On your first question about how we will capitalize assets, we intend to be stingy with the equity of this company. And only when we are trading at what we think are very attractive values, ideally premiums to net asset value, will issuing equity even be considered a possibility for us. When it comes to flexibility and how we finance things, there are a number of assets in this portfolio, that, if we believe we can recycle within the portfolio by selling assets at values that dramatically exceed replacement costs, we will do that and deploy that capital into net new value creation opportunities, in particular where the yields on costs are high. And when we look at yields on costs, we don't look at yield on cost from the standpoint of incremental cost only. We look at yields on costs from the standpoint of what is our land actually worth and what is the yield on cost for the new project inclusive of that land value. Because if that doesn't pencil, then it points more toward simply selling your land. And that's a well-trodden path for us as far as the thought process. When it comes to capital sources, I've talked about project-level leverage, nonrecourse asset-level financing. We also have, by virtue of our third-party capital business, a ton of relationships that we have cultivated over decades of prospective joint venture partners. Many of them will be much happier that we are in a permanent capital structure than in a finite life vehicle. Because many of the best partners out there want a partner who will hang around with them potentially forever if that's the plan and not have an artificial arbitrary exit date imposed upon them by virtue of a fund life. Those partners are folks that can be selectively resources and capital providers, often at times when the REIT markets are not the most efficient source of capital, to fund new opportunities. We will have to weigh that against how much of an asset we want to own, how much of the vig do we want to own in a project versus how much do we want to share with an investment partner. And frankly, are we getting enough out of the deal with that partner to warrant doing that. But that analysis is one that is -- really forms a bedrock of how and when we have decided to do everything that we've done throughout our history. And that won't be changing in this new construct."

Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south,",982,"Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call. 
Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good, actually, except for the hotel business, which continues to head south, our Hotel Pennsylvania included, suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for Farley and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza district in the very center of the new West Side are the next big thing, actually, really big thing for our company. 
We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development in progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every 4 days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria's Secret flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue, which will be the new home of a 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our High Line project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and at 606 Broadway construction has begun. 
In Washington, at Pentagon City, the Whole Foods and the 699 unit apartment have opened, achieving an extraordinary 45% lease up in just the first 2 months, way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City, WeWork WeLive has also opened, achieving 80% occupancy of the 2/3 of the units that are open. 
The success of the apartments validates our plan to emphasize residential newbuilds on our nearby vacant land inventory and on select sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Over time, we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to the apartments immediately. 
So in Crystal City, Pentagon City, our business plan is residential heavy and newbuild heavy, all while we continue to grow our office income. 
A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter, the financing markets have settled down. We are in a borrower's market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher, however, is the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has gapped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, new hotels, and speculative development in New York, which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us. 
In the transactions market after a record-breaking year in 2015, volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors: Volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high-quality product, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high-quality office retail and multifamily product, though bidding pools have somewhat bid. Capital continues to aggressively pursue in New York, which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the U.S. and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue and believe this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York. 
A couple of comps that are worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway, a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway, a couple of blocks from our Penn plaza holdings went under contract to a private foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilized yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located and much higher quality.
As a retail comp, 155 Mercer Street, a retail condo in SoHo occupied by Dolce and Gabbana recently went under contract to a private investor group for $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. 
Finally, pricing in San Francisco continues to set records, 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square foot new building near Transbay Center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square foot. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco, 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark. 
In May, we completed a $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million, of which $159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and $43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The tax gain was $90 million, we continue to manage and lease the property.
Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the second quarter, we leased 1,025,000 square feet in 97 transactions. In New York, we leased 544,000 square feet of office space, including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island city. The average starting rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island city was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. 
In Washington, we leased 369,000 square feet, but mark-to-markets excluding Skyline were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash.
Yesterday, we called for redemption on our 6 7/8  Series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded out of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activities."

Adjusted FFO, which we formerly called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share as compared to $1.26 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we previewed on last quarter's call, this quarter -- this year's second quarter has some accounting noise, which masks the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me take you through the math. In our New York business, the quarter's results include $7.9 million of noncash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight-line rent receivables triggered by our early termination of New York office leases, primarily J.Crew and Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One at 90 Park Avenue, which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this noncash write-off of straight-line rent receivable reduces our GAAP earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future period earnings. 
Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year second quarter, remember that the prior year's second quarter included $5.4 million of noncash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate & Barrel lease at 650 Madison, again, to clear out space for higher-paying tenants. 
In addition, as David will explain shortly, the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by $5.1 million. The punchline is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison of growth of our New York core earnings by $18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items, New York's earnings grew by $28.2 million or 11.1%. 
We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015. 
Let me comment on our fad ratio, which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord's work related to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last 2 years is occurring ahead of the commencement of the $216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8-K dated June 7, 2016. 
Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter, in addition to the $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned, we completed a $273 million refinancing of the Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington D.C. office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as a fixed rate of 3.65% is interest-only for the first 2 years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 3. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%, $293 million mortgage. 
Also in the quarter, at 280 Park Avenue, the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture, we completed a $900 million refinancing. The 3-year loan with 4, 1-year options is interest-only at LIBOR plus 2% -- 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $725 million mortgage.
We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's crossroads, Virginia. The loan is recoursed only to these Skyline properties. 
In the second quarter, cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default, causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental default rate of interest. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we accrued $2.7 million of default interest expense. 
Excluding Skyline, our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $593.6 million, consisting primarily of the $550 million, 5.57% Mart loan, which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. 
Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is $75.6 million. 
Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South projects, which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are: Fixed-rate debt accounted for 73% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and floating rate debt accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years. Debt-to-enterprise value is 24%. Debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.2x including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys""R""Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2x.
In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have $4.3 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. 
I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum."
312648,318294855,1409129,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Steve, thank you.

I want to begin my remarks this morning by offering a few observations on the current markets and what it means for Vornado. We have lived through an unusually volatile first half of this year, the China slowdown and a surprise Brexit vote. Despite the disruptive potential of these 2 events, the stock market has been resilient. While many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets as ""Moving sideways"" the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing has at first 6 months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet comparable to 10-year averages, although activity was largely driven by renewals. Importantly, sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in 8 years. 
On prior calls, we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of the TAMI sector making the city less reliant on the traditional financial services sector. Interestingly, this year, we have seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the health care sector, which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services. Just recently, NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building, which is less than 15 years old, had been occupied by a prominent law firm. 
While not typically considered a large occupier of office space, over the last 5 years, some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined health care and education sectors. And we at Vornado have a significant share of those operations, with Colombia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, NYU Langone at One Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue, a total of 700,000 square feet of health care operations. 
Ultimately, the key to our market is jobs, specifically office using jobs. For the first 6 months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high. At 5%, the city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. 
Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to the Verizon strike. 2 months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.
Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well positioned. On the office side, we have 8 trophy buildings that command $100 plus rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West side, including Penn Plaza and Chelsea, where tenants increasingly want to be. We have completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last 3 years totaling 6.5 million square feet, ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopments in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet.
On the street retail side, our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the Bowtie in Times Square, Madison Avenue, SoHo and 34th Street. 
Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96% in 544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activity, some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67, representing mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue, which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redeveloped asset. The balance of our leasing activity this quarter, some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of 2 leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island city. These leases at starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect a rapidly changing Long Island city landscape, representing mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place, the yield on our investment in this building is now 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the re-leasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.
For the first 6 months of the year, we closed 6 of Crain's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Alston & Bird at 90 Park Avenue; Facebook and AOL, Verizon at 770 Broadway; Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue; and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. 
I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio. We continue to see that in our ability to make more than our fair share of deals of $100 plus per square foot. In the second quarter, we signed 3 such leases, a total of 34,500 square feet at the average starting rents of $143 per foot. Year-to-date, we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet. 
In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity and 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the 4 Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search, the 4 Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue as the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly 6 decades at the Seagram’s building. The new restaurant, when it opens in late 2017, will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program, a clear sign of our success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue. 
At 692 Broadway, AOL signed a 10,000 square foot lease for a new experiential concept, a studio space for the Huffington Post live interview series. And at 11 Penn Plaza, MSG Networks renewed some [indiscernible]  square feet of studio space on the ground floor and lower level. Our largest and best in class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash. 
Let me now turn to the market in Chicago. In June, we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors. It's a wow. Our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair spanning over 5,000 square feet, which also serves as a 200-plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events, a shared lounge at the top of the stairs, an outdoor green space and a giant food hall, all have received rave reviews from our tenants and they complete the building's transition from showroom space to what Crain's Chicago called a top destination for technology tenants and Chicago Tribune referred to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool, and we are not done yet. Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and its daily population of over 25,000 as well as a transit stop directly into the building, we're now exploring opening up a retail artisanal market featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our website at vno.com and click on to theMART to see the images of this transformation or even better yet, ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. 
ConAgra and Allstate have now moved into the building with Beam Suntory to follow in the fall. 
For the first 6 months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8%. And we are continuing the transformation of this asset by converting at year-end an additional 80,000 square feet of tradeshow space on the eighth floor to additional office space. TheMART's same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash. 
Turning now to San Francisco. In the second quarter, Bank of America expanded its presence in 555 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week, after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across 2 floors with McKinsey and Company, the renowned consulting firm, which is one of our long standing tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot, we believe these 2 tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town, reaffirm the building's status as the premier office building in San Francisco. But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off a redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrade to tenant amenity spaces and of course, multiple new food offerings. 
The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1%, reflecting the space that we recently got back when BOA vacated its original banking cube. We are now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the cube and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.
Overall for the New York division, we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP, 2.9% [ph] cash. These same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania where, as Steve mentioned, business has been very weak, reflecting the down cycle in the New York Hotel business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.
To conclude my remarks, let me say, we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multi-tenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of these reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years, we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over 1 million square feet of leases in active dialogue.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington."

The Washington D.C. metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly, for our business, 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services, including tech-related and stem sectors. 
Unemployment in the D.C. region has continued downward, is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country. In the second quarter, both Downtown D.C. and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in D.C.  Year-to-date, the numbers are showing slow but steady absorption. 
In residential, the D.C. metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption. Notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop, the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom. 
Let me review our second quarter leasing and occupancy metrics and please note all of these exclude Skyline property. We completed 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-markets were flattish, negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3%, down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. 
Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is 2 GSA tenants who vacated, both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants, 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
And finally, residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%. 
In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June, we opened the Bartlett, our new 699 unit apartment building in Pentagon City. Located directly atop a new 40,000 square feet Whole Foods, this 23-story building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan D.C. area. When surveyed, 67% of our residents reported they selected the Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package, consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, validating our intense focus on the tenant experience.
The market response to the Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renter's moved in on June 2 and through yesterday, we have leased 314 units, that's 45% of the building already. With this philosophy and rents that are higher than we projected, we are very pleased with our performance to-date. 
Meanwhile, in Crystal City, WeWork opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into a WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and is invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this venture.
The Bartlett and WeLive bring our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro served in Georgetown and close in Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned, in July, we received approvals to develop the next phase of the metropolitan park block, a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature [indiscernible]  style architecture coupled with Vornado's signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett, will have commanding views of D.C. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.
Including this new project, we can build almost 5,600 additional apartments in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select teardowns of aging office buildings. 
In Downtown D.C, at the corner of 17th and M streets, we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot trophy office building, 1700M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right.

We've got very good activity. So I don't think -- Steve, unless we want to say anything specifically about the bridge, I don't think there's anything material to talk about in terms of that number."

So I'll give you an example. I mean, we've been -- we're thrilled with this Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it you ought to make a trip down there and take a look. So it's a -- it's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well-received, I think, done  in the Washington District in years and years and years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a, give or take, a 7 and the value of that building, if you value the marketplace for first class apartment and brand new product, is X. If you divide those 2 numbers, there is a very satisfactory return on that capital. By the way, we built that building free and clear. We didn't use any debt to build that building. So the long and the short of it is, and I think I said in my prepared remarks, that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings. We want to build the next one immediately, the one after that quickly and more and more and more. So we think that, that's a very interesting business. Now we -- and we're excited about it. So we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly, we have the very scarce, very important land holdings in and around the Pentagon City and in Crystal City. So if you don't have the land, you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific, very satisfactory. And we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we are extremely optimistic about development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City. I don't think I was bashful in my opening remarks. Now I look at this all differently. I -- if we do separate -- and by the way, we have sort of -- that's the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that, I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington, call it whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it as if we're just moving from one pocket to the other. It will be well capitalized with enough capital. I'm talking about Washington-co or the SpinCo to complete its development and complete its mission, and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think that our company will do both. If we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its development initiative for sure."

First off, we're very, very happy with where we are -- where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last 3, 4 years to get here. So our debt is very low. When Steve Theriot went through some of the statistics, he just said casually, well, our debt is 25%. Well, 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great. Our liquidity is superb, the best in the business. And so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that, we -- evidenced by our calling a series of preferreds yesterday that, we think, that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. It doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view, but it certainly increases our earnings. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, I said over the last better part of 1.5 years maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high, that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny. And that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing for first-quality assets that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market. There hasn't been a hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date, and the reason is that hotel business, as we've discussed already, is very soft. Obviously, the condo -- well, not obviously, but factually, the condo market is also soft -- not our condo, of course, but other people's condos. That's sort of a joke. But it's really not a joke, it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently -- that first-class properties are currently offered.

We're not in the hope business, we're in the realistic business. And so we believe rents have gotten to the point where they are too high, and retailers are not comfortable paying those rents. So that's step one. The second part of it is our retail portfolio is pretty full -- very full, actually. We completed the last 2 big deals in town: The Victoria's Secret, huge megadeal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch megadeal on Upper Fifth as well. So we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin. So 4 years ago or 5 years ago, there might have been 3 or 4 or more retailers bidding for a particular prime space on a prime street. Right now, there's barely 1 or 2. And they're difficult to close because people -- retailers are concerned. Retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high. We're aware of that, and obviously, we're in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the street are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is the volumes are fine, but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be, I believe, the strongest, in my opinion -- the strongest market in the city. SoHo and Broadway are softish. 34th Street is doing fine.

And we have worked with the government powers that be so that in general, we can take down an older building and we build a building, which is 150% the size of that or something like that, okay? So the financial analysis goes like this. Do you take this 40-year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to let it with the understanding that, that capital will have to be amortized over, pick a number, a 10-year lease and at the end of that 10-year lease, that 40 year-old building is now 50 years old. So that's one column of numbers and concept. The second column is you take it down, build a brand new residential building, which will have -- which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just a matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand new first-class residential product is a very, very profitable and good trade. In addition to that, the -- when you get thousands of units in a tight cluster, you get a community and that creates more value. And we know how to create that community and amenitize it and make it so that people will consider this a very, very fine place to live, thinking about where it is, where it's located to, where jobs are, the metro access of it. And by the way, it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall, which is 1 of the top 10 malls in the country, and the Whole Foods, et cetera.

So we've got $1 billion Macy's and Madison Square Garden and we sit on top of the Station. We don't sit 4 blocks away and you have to walk to it in the rain, we sit on top of it. So the basic -- and by the way, the basis that we have in our buildings is you go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary. So you have all that as a backdrop. Now the way we look at it, let's take and cut it into bite-size pieces. So take 1 Penn and 2 Penn, which together are 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published. You know what they are. They -- the first digit is a 5, and we believe that notwithstanding anything else, we can transform those buildings in this marketplace, so that the average starting rent will be higher. I don't want to get into math now, but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's a capital program, and we're going to do that and that's actually the #1 priority of what we're about. And then there's peripheral development. The retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary. And then we've got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have, I think, very intelligently delayed up until now. And so you know where you have it. We do is we take -- we leg into the project piece by piece. Now with respect to the overall amount of capital that we will be committing to this district, it's 8 million, 9 million feet.  It's huge, it's enormous, it all has very large paybacks and the most important part of it is Vornado is a fortress, financially, and has the capital ability to finance all this.

So we have the opportunity to both build a quality product, measure the demand, meet the demand and also modulate the supply as we see it. So we're very comfortable with our position and with our program at this point."

So at 220 Central Park South, which you seem to be especially interested in, we have the best site, we have the best project, we have the best design, et cetera. But as importantly, we bring a 2% cost of capital to that project. We are competing against people up and down the block, in fact, all over the place, that are paying 12% and 15% for money. As you can imagine, it's not a fair fight, okay? In Crystal City and Pentagon City, my thinking is not dissimilar to that. We own great land parcels and so I look upon that right now as being a sub-cost. We have the capital to build and develop, and this is different than office buildings. If you put up 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 square foot big office building and you catch a weak market, the building either stays vacant for year after year after year. By the way, there's dozens of example of that in the Washington region, or you have to take the price down to a number, which marks it a huge loss. Residential development is different than that, and that is if for a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side of the light you sign a long-term lease and you're locked in to that price, good or bad, for a very long time. In the residential business, the rents will fluctuate with the market, and so over time, you're able to get what the market is -- the market thinks is the fair rent. So they're very different. We will be aggressive in building on the land that we already own there. That's our business plan."

Our preferences are to be in the income-producing property business as opposed to a onetime for-sale condo business. We're doing 220 Central Park South now.

We also have a residential portfolio in Manhattan, which is performing quite well and that is a business with the correct entry point that we would invest in, although we do not have anywhere near the scale in that business that we have in office and it retail.
