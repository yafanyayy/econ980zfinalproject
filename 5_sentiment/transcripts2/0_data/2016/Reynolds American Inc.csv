I am absolutely delighted by our strong finish to what was already shaping up to be a remarkable year. RAI and all of our operating companies reported excellent results and integration of Newport continued to go very well. 2015 was truly a transformational year for RAI and its operating companies. And we have started the new year with significant momentum, especially in terms of returning value to our shareholders, a topic many of you are most interested in. 
Since the first of the year, we've taken 3 steps in particular that benefit our investors. First, as we announced this morning, we are increasing our dividend by 16.7%. Second, we successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States for $5 billion in cash. And third, we recently announced the tender offer and redemption for the early repayment of some of the company's outstanding debt. As we said in the past, deleveraging is a priority for RAI and we're making good progress. And we're taking all these steps, while still investing in our core businesses as well as in innovations that are key to the success of our long-term growth and our transformation strategies. 
Before I discuss our core business performance, I'd like to give you an update on the innovations front. As you know, we recently created the RAI innovations company, which is focused on product development and commercialization of leading edge vapor and nicotine products. RAI innovations will drive speed to market with new products across the range of platform. In addition, the vapor collaboration that's now underway between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco will facilitate the company's efforts to more efficiently meet the preferences of adult tobacco consumers in a rapidly evolving marketplace. And of course, one of the beneficiaries of that focus will be RJ Reynolds' vapor company's VUSE digital vapor cigarette. VUSE continue to perform very well in traditional retail channels, and its 4 additional styles that were introduced into September have been well received by adult tobacco consumers. The brand also introduced VUSE Connect, which is available online in the fourth quarter and VUSE also be available online starting next month. 
VUSE Port, a revolutionary liquid-based vapor tank system; and VUSE Pro, an innovative closed system will be introduced later this year. Adult tobacco consumers are looking for a vapor experience that delivers the performance and satisfaction of a tank with the simplicity of a light. Innovation backed by superior quality has helped make VUSE the vapor category leader, and we believe these new VUSE products will deliver what adult vapors want. 
In addition, our subsidiary remains focused on national distribution of Zonnic gum. Zonnic is now in more than 31,000 retail outlets, and the brand's expansion continues to go very well. 
Now let's discuss our operating company's performance, starting with cigarettes. Total domestic cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 33.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the addition of the Newport brand to R.J. Reynolds portfolio. For the industry, overall cigarette volume declined just 5/10 of a percent for the quarter benefiting from lower gas prices and improved employment rates, both of which positively impacted adult tobacco consumers disposable income. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 2/10 of a percent. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 33.8%, while their drive brands gained 6/10 of a percentage point to 31.3%. At RJ Reynolds, fourth quarter performance came in very strong and that was largely the result of Newport growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, the brand's integration continues to progress very well, and the company is on track to complete the manufacturing transition to the tobacco facility this year. Newport was added to R.J. Reynolds' retail contracts in mid-November following the exploration of the initial 5-month standstill period, and the brands expanded presence is delivering additional gains. As a result, R.J. Reynolds improved both adjusted operating income and margin substantially, as the company's mix to premium price brands grew to just over 70%. 
I'll remind you that R.J. Reynolds' retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.8%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brand, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall added 2/10 of a percentage point in combined market share to 29.3% for the quarter. And these 3 brands now make up about 92% of the company's total market share.
I'm very pleased to report that Newport's growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter with the brand share of retail shipments increasing 6/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.6%, on volume growth of 4.8%. That's testament not just a Newport's expanded retail presence and the superior execution of the R.J. Reynolds trade marketing team, but also to the inherent equity of the brand. In addition, the company's consumer engagement on Newport is having a positive impact and that goes well for the brand in the year ahead. 
R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brand's, Camel and Pall Mall, continue to play key roles in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy and maintains steady performance in the fourth quarter. Camel's retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8%. Pall Mall's market share was down 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at 7.8%. While the brand has remained stable for the past 3 quarters, despite R.J. Reynolds seeing uptrading to premium price brands. R.J. Reynolds' consumer market team has exciting marketing plan for all the drive brands this year and these equity building initiatives are expected to further enhance performance. 
I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff also delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in the fourth quarter, and it's not hard to see why. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium styles achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continue to make double-digit gain, increasing almost 18.5% for the quarter. At American Snuff, the flagship Grizzly brand continue to outperform the moist snuff industry. Grizzly increased fourth quarter market share by 9/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 30.8%, and that was on volume growth of 6.6% compared with the industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter. 
All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of all of our operating companies. And I'm confident that they will continue their strong momentum and find additional opportunities for growth in 2016, allowing RAI to continue to return great value to our shareholders. These accomplishments do not happen by themselves, and I give the credit to our employees for their dedication and hard work. They're changing the game for both RAI and for the industry. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

On many measures, Reynolds American and its operating companies had another outstanding quarter and that brought our year to a very successful conclusion. As Susan said, our companies are making substantial progress and as a result, the RAI board has approved an increase of 16.7% in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.42 per share or an annualized $1.68. This is consistent with our 75% target payout ratio. The dividend will be payable on April 1 to shareholders of record on March 10. 
RAI continues to deliver against its commitment to returning value to shareholders and will continue to look for additional opportunities to enhance that value over the long term. Now let's turn to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, RAI increased reported EPS by 35.7% from the prior year quarter to $0.19. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.48, up 9.1% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by strong volumes across the board as well as higher pricing. Adjusted EPS excludes the following items. A charge of $0.11 per share for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, a charge of $0.01 per share for implementation cost primarily related to the sale of Natural American Spirit business outside the United States, a charge of $0.02 per share for tax items, a reduction of $0.17 per share related to the gain on divestiture, a benefit of $0.01 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim and a one-time benefit of $0.01 per share for the New York NPM settlement. For the full year, RAI's reported EPS was $2.57 and that was up 87.6% from the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.98, up 15.8% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned as well as other items from earlier in the year, namely transaction related and financing costs, asset impairment and exit charges, and charges with Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. RAI's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin came in very strong again, increasing by 4.6 percentage points to 41.2%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results were applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. The company's reported operating income was $915 million. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income increased by 66.2% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion, benefiting from Newport's contribution as well as higher cigarette pricing with robust net price realization. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' reported operating income was $3.4 billion. Full year adjusted operating income increased by just over 43% to $3.8 billion. You can really see R.J. Reynolds' improved performance in its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 4.1 percentage points to 44.6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the year's adjusted operating margin to 44.4%.
R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments were up 34.6% from the prior year quarter, driven by the addition of Newport. I would just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 400 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatedly stable and reflect the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio. 
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also benefited from higher pricing and volume in the fourth quarter. Santa Fe's reported operating income was $112 million. On an adjusted basis, which excludes a one-time benefit of $1 million from the New York NPM settlement, the company's operating income came in at $111 million for the quarter, which was up 22.9%. For the full year, reported operating income was $449 million, while adjusted operating income increased 33.1% to $448 million. Santa Fe's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin gained 1.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 52.8%. 
For the year, adjusted operating margin came in at 54.8%. So I'm happy to report another strong performance by Santa Fe and its Natural American Spirit brand. 
Now let's turn to the strong showing in American Snuff. The company's fourth quarter reported operating income was $133 million, while adjusted operating income rose 18.4% to $134 million. Of course, these adjusted results benefited from higher volume and strong net pricing growth of almost 5%. Adjusted results exclude a $1 million charge for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, all of which added up to another strong year for American Snuff. Reported operating income rose to $502 million from the prior year, while adjusted operating income increased 13.9% to $503 million. American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 3.3 percentage points to 59.4%, and for the year, adjusted operating margin came to 58.8%. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, there're some other important items that I'd like to cover. As you know, we completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. in January for $5 billion. And we're moving quickly on our commitment to deleverage as efficiently as possible, while maintaining financial flexibility. To that end, we announced on February 4, a cash tender offer for up to $2.8 billion aggregate cash spend for certain outstanding notes and the redemption of $950 million aggregate principal amount of certain other outstanding notes. 
Final details of the tender and redemption will be announced upon completion. Given this progress, we would expect to reach the top end of our target leverage of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of this year. RAI ended the year with total long-term debt of $16.9 billion. And as we've said before, we currently have a very manageable debt portfolio, which will be considerably reduced following the tender and redemption.
At the end of 2015, the company had cash balances of $2.6 billion, and in January, we contributed $325 million to the pension plans to further strengthen the plan's funded status. So based on the achievements in 2015 and our expectations for the year ahead, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $2.25 to $2.35, up 13.6% to 18.7% over last year's adjusted EPS of $1.98.

Obviously, I think the macroeconomic factors are pointing into the consumer's favor this year as it did in 2015. We are expecting 2% to 3% decline for next year. With regard to the synergies, the $800 million in synergies that we've talked about continues to be our expectation. We've not identified anything meaningful, positive or negative, that would have us come off of that number at this time. So we certainly are, I would say, a bit ahead of schedule in terms of achieving the synergies. And we hope to achieve those as quickly as we can. As you know, we've incentivized our organization to do that as quickly as possible. But the 800 continues to be the number, and it is our hope that we can accelerate that throughout the year. The last question you had was one VUSE and, I guess, the investment that we have on vapor. And I'm not sure I have any specifics on that. I think, we continue to make great progress, certainly, the consolidation in the manufacturing facilities that we had in the back half of 2015 was a real positive. It put us on a very good position from a cost basis. We continue to make progress on our cost structure and certain profitability objectives that we have going forward. But a lot of it will depend on how do the innovations -- how are they receive by the consumers and how quickly do we look to expand that or not.

I think, our view on the volume in the long term, we've seen 2% to 4% declines in this sector on combustible. And we are taking the view this year that it will be on a low end of that range. So remodel that 2% to 3% range. Obviously, it would be nice to be wrong.

One, the significantly larger sales force. Reynolds took that brand over in July, August.

So we have continued to -- we have seen that acceleration.

Joining me this morning are RAI's President and CEO, Susan Cameron; and Andrew Gilchrist, our CFO. 
The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements. When we talk about future results or events, a number of factors could generate results that are materially different from our projections today. These factors include, but are not limited to, items detailed in our press release and SEC filings. Except as provided by federal securities laws, we're not required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'd also remind you that RAI's website is our primary source of publicly disclosed news and that we also use Twitter to disseminate company news.
And now I'll turn the call over to Susan."

I am absolutely delighted by our strong finish to what was already shaping up to be a remarkable year. RAI and all of our operating companies reported excellent results, and the integration of Newport continued to go very well. 2015 was truly a transformational year for RAI and its operating companies. And we have started the new year with significant momentum, especially in terms of returning value to our shareholders, a topic many of you are most interested in.
Since the first of the year, we've taken 3 steps in particular that benefit our investors: first, as we announced this morning, we're increasing our dividend by 16.7%; second, we successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States for $5 billion in cash; and third, we recently announced the tender offer and redemption for the early repayment of some of the company's outstanding debt. As we said in the past, deleveraging is a priority for RAI, and we're making good progress. And we're taking all these steps while still investing in our core businesses as well as in innovations that are key to the success of our long-term growth and our transformation strategies.
Before I discuss our core business performance, I'd like to give you an update on the innovations front. As you know, we recently created the RAI Innovations Company, which is focused on product development and commercialization of leading-edge vapor and nicotine products. RAI innovations will drive speed to market with new products across a range of platforms. In addition, the vapor collaboration that's now underway between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco will facilitate the company's efforts to more efficiently meet the preferences of adult tobacco consumers in a rapidly evolving marketplace. 
And of course, one of the beneficiaries of that focus will be R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company's VUSE digital vapor cigarette. VUSE continues to perform very well in traditional retail channels. And its 4 additional styles that were introduced into September have been well received by adult tobacco consumers. The brand also introduced VUSE Connect, which is available online, in the fourth quarter. And VUSE Fob will also be available online starting next month. VUSE Port, a revolutionary liquid-based vapor tank system, and VUSE Pro, an innovative closed-cartridge system, will be introduced later this year. Adult tobacco consumers are looking for a vapor experience that delivers the performance and satisfaction of a tank with the simplicity of a cigalike. Innovation, backed by superior quality, has helped make VUSE the vapor category leader. And we believe these new VUSE products will deliver what adult vapors want. In addition, our Niconovum subsidiary remains focused on the national distribution of Zonnic gum. Zonnic is now in more than 31,000 retail outlets, and the brand's expansion continues to go very well.
Now let's discuss our operating company's performance, starting with cigarettes. Total domestic cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 33.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the addition of the Newport brand to R.J. Reynolds' portfolio. For the industry, overall cigarette volume declined just 0.5% for the quarter, benefiting from lower gas prices and improved employment rates, both of which positively impacted adult tobacco consumers' disposable income. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 0.2%. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 33.8%, while their drive brands gained 0.6 percentage point to 31.3%. At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter performance came in very strong, and that was largely the result of Newport's growth.
As I mentioned earlier, the brand's integration continues to progress very well, and the company is on track to complete the manufacturing transition to the tobacco facility this year. Newport was added to R.J. Reynolds' retail contracts in mid-November, following the expiration of the initial 5-month standstill period, and the brand's expanded presence is delivering additional gains. As a result, R.J. Reynolds improved both adjusted operating income and margin substantially as the company's mix to premium-priced brands grew to just over 70%.
I'll remind you that R.J. Reynolds' retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.8%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 0.2 percentage point in combined market share to 29.3% for the quarter. And these 3 brands now make up about 92% of the company's total market share.
I'm very pleased to report that Newport's growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter, with the brand share of retail shipments increasing 0.6 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.6% on volume growth of 4.8%. That's testament not just to Newport's expanded retail presence and the superior execution of the R.J. Reynolds' trade marketing team, but also to the inherent equity of the brand. In addition, the company's consumer engagement on Newport is having a positive impact, and that bodes well for the brand in the year ahead. 
R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continue to play key roles in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy and maintained steady performance in the fourth quarter. Camel's retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8%. Pall Mall's market share was down 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter at 7.8%, while the brand has remained stable for the past 3 quarters despite R.J. Reynolds seeing uptrading to premium-priced brands. R.J. Reynolds' consumer marketing teams have exciting plans for all the drive brands this year. And these equity-building initiatives are expected to further enhance performance.
I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff also delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in the fourth quarter, and it's not hard to see why. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super-premium styles achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continued to make double-digit gain, increasing almost 18.5% for the quarter. At American Snuff, the flagship Grizzly brand continued to outperform the moist snuff industry. Grizzly increased fourth quarter market share by 0.9 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 30.8%. And that was on volume growth of 6.6% compared with the industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter.
All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of all of our operating companies. And I'm confident that they'll continue their strong momentum and find additional opportunities for growth in 2016, allowing RAI to continue to return great value to our shareholders. These accomplishments do not happen by themselves, and I give the credit to our employees for their dedication and hard work. They're changing the game for both RAI and for the industry. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

On many measures, Reynolds American and its operating companies had another outstanding quarter, and that brought our year to a very successful conclusion. 
As Susan said, our companies are making substantial progress. And as a result, the RAI board has approved an increase of 16.7% in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.42 per share or an annualized $1.68. This is consistent with our 75% target payout ratio. The dividend will be payable on April 1 to shareholders of record on March 10. RAI continues to deliver against its commitment to returning value to shareholders and will continue to look for additional opportunities to enhance that value over the long term. 
Now let's turn to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, RAI increased reported EPS by 35.7% from the prior year quarter to $0.19. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.48, up 9.1% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by strong volumes across the board as well as higher pricing. 
Adjusted EPS excludes the following items: a charge of $0.11 per share for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments; a charge of $0.01 per share for implementation costs primarily related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States; a charge of $0.02 per share for tax items; a reduction of $0.17 per share related to the gain on divestiture; a benefit of $0.01 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim; and a onetime benefit of $0.01 per share for the New York NPM settlement. For the full year, RAI's reported EPS was $2.57, and that was up 87.6% from the prior year.
Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.98, up 15.8% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned as well as other items from earlier in the year, namely, transaction-related and financing costs, asset impairment and exit charges and charges with Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. 
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin came in very strong again, increasing by 4.6 percentage points to 41.2%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. The company's reported operating income was $915 million. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income increased by 66.2% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion, benefiting from Newport's contribution as well as higher cigarette pricing with robust net price realization. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' reported operating income was $3.4 billion. Full year adjusted operating income increased by just over 43% to $3.8 billion. You can really see R.J. Reynolds' improved performance in its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 4.1 percentage points to 44.6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the year's adjusted operating margin to 44.4%.
R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments were up 34.6% from the prior year quarter, driven by the addition of Newport. I would just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 400 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatively stable and reflects the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also benefited from higher pricing and volume in the fourth quarter. Santa Fe's reported operating income was $112 million. On an adjusted basis, which excludes a onetime benefit of $1 million from the New York NPM settlement, the company's operating income came in at $111 million for the quarter, which was up 22.9%. For the full year, reported operating income was $449 million, while adjusted operating income increased 33.1% to $448 million. Santa Fe's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin gained 1.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 52.8%. For the year, adjusted operating margin came in at 54.8%. So I'm happy to report another strong performance by Santa Fe and its Natural American Spirit brand.
Now let's turn to the strong showing in American Snuff. The company's fourth quarter reported operating income was $133 million, while adjusted operating income rose 18.4% to $134 million. Of course, these adjusted results benefited from higher volume and strong net pricing growth of almost 5%. Adjusted results exclude a $1 million charge for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, all of which added up to another strong year for American Snuff. Reported operating income rose to $502 million from the prior year, while adjusted operating income increased 13.9% to $503 million. American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 3.3 percentage points to 59.4%. And for the year, adjusted operating margin came to 58.8%.
Before I turn to the Q&A, there are some other important items that I'd like to cover. As you know, we completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. in January for $5 billion. And we're moving quickly on our commitment to deleverage as efficiently as possible while maintaining financial flexibility. To that end, we announced on February 4 a cash tender offer for up to $2.8 billion aggregate cash spent for certain outstanding notes and the redemption of $950 million aggregate principal amount of certain other outstanding notes.
Final details of the tender and redemption will be announced upon completion. Given this progress, we would expect to reach the top end of our target leverage of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of this year. RAI ended the year with total long-term debt of $16.9 billion. And as we've said before, we currently have a very manageable debt portfolio, which will be considerably reduced following the tender and redemption.
At the end of 2015, the company had cash balances of $2.6 billion. And in January, we contributed $325 million to the pension plans to further strengthen the plan's funded status. So based on the achievements in 2015 and our expectations for the year ahead, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $2.25 to $2.35, up 13.6% to 18.7% over last year's adjusted EPS of $1.98.

We obviously think the macroeconomic factors are pointing into the consumers' favor this year as it did in 2015, but we are expecting 2% to 3% decline for next year. With regard to the synergies, the $800 million in synergies that we've talked about continues to be our expectation. We have not identified anything meaningful, positive or negative, that would have us come off of that number at this time. So we certainly are, I would say, a bit ahead of schedule in terms of achieving the synergies, and we hope to achieve those as quickly as we can. As you know, we've incentivized our organization to do that as quickly as possible. But the $800 million continues to be the number. And it is our hope that we can accelerate that throughout the year. The last question you had was on VUSE and, I guess, the investment that we have on vapor. And I'm not sure I have any specifics on that. I think we continue to make great progress. Certainly, the consolidation of the manufacturing facilities that we had in the back half of 2015 was a real positive. It put us on a very good position from a cost basis. We continue to make progress on our cost structure and certain profitability objectives that we have going forward. But a lot of it will depend on how do the innovations -- how are they received by the consumers and how quickly do we look to expand that or not.

I think our view on the volume, in the long term, we've seen 2% to 4% declines in this sector on combustible. And we are taking the view this year that it will be on the low end of that range.

And we saw it both in premium menthol, and we saw it in the non-menthol, particularly the Red style. So I would -- we are crediting that to a couple of things: one, the significantly larger sales force, Reynolds took that brand over in July, August; number two, we started to have our contracts starting to set up from the middle of November. And the first contracts to be converted were the menthol-only contracts, which were previously the strongest Newport outlet. And so we have continued to -- we have seen that acceleration. And certainly, if you compare it historically to Newport's growth, Newport historically got all its growth in market share somehow in the first quarter and then held on. So we -- and this is, of course, the first year we've owned it, and we've only owned it for 2 quarters.

I am absolutely delighted by our strong finish to what was already shaping up to be a remarkable year. RAI and all of our operating companies reported excellent results, and the integration of Newport continued to go very well. 2015 was truly a transformational year for RAI and its operating companies. And we have started the new year with significant momentum, especially in terms of returning value to our shareholders, a topic many of you are most interested in.
Since the first of the year, we've taken 3 steps in particular that benefit our investors: first, as we announced this morning, we're increasing our dividend by 16.7%; second, we successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States for $5 billion in cash; and third, we recently announced the tender offer and redemption for the early repayment of some of the company's outstanding debt. As we said in the past, deleveraging is a priority for RAI, and we're making good progress. And we're taking all these steps while still investing in our core businesses as well as in innovations that are key to the success of our long-term growth and our transformation strategies.
Before I discuss our core business performance, I'd like to give you an update on the innovations front. As you know, we recently created the RAI Innovations Company, which is focused on product development and commercialization of leading-edge vapor and nicotine products. RAI innovations will drive speed to market with new products across a range of platforms. In addition, the vapor collaboration that's now underway between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco will facilitate the company's efforts to more efficiently meet the preferences of adult tobacco consumers in a rapidly evolving marketplace. 
And of course, one of the beneficiaries of that focus will be R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company's VUSE digital vapor cigarette. VUSE continues to perform very well in traditional retail channels. And its 4 additional styles that were introduced into September have been well received by adult tobacco consumers. The brand also introduced VUSE Connect, which is available online, in the fourth quarter. And VUSE Fob will also be available online starting next month. VUSE Port, a revolutionary liquid-based vapor tank system, and VUSE Pro, an innovative closed-cartridge system, will be introduced later this year. Adult tobacco consumers are looking for a vapor experience that delivers the performance and satisfaction of a tank with the simplicity of a cigalike. Innovation, backed by superior quality, has helped make VUSE the vapor category leader. And we believe these new VUSE products will deliver what adult vapors want. In addition, our Niconovum subsidiary remains focused on the national distribution of Zonnic gum. Zonnic is now in more than 31,000 retail outlets, and the brand's expansion continues to go very well.
Now let's discuss our operating company's performance, starting with cigarettes. Total domestic cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 33.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the addition of the Newport brand to R.J. Reynolds' portfolio. For the industry, overall cigarette volume declined just 0.5% for the quarter, benefiting from lower gas prices and improved employment rates, both of which positively impacted adult tobacco consumers' disposable income. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 0.2%. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 33.8%, while their drive brands gained 0.6 percentage point to 31.3%. At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter performance came in very strong, and that was largely the result of Newport's growth.
As I mentioned earlier, the brand's integration continues to progress very well, and the company is on track to complete the manufacturing transition to the tobacco facility this year. Newport was added to R.J. Reynolds' retail contracts in mid-November, following the expiration of the initial 5-month standstill period, and the brand's expanded presence is delivering additional gains. As a result, R.J. Reynolds improved both adjusted operating income and margin substantially as the company's mix to premium-priced brands grew to just over 70%.
I'll remind you that R.J. Reynolds' retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.8%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 0.2 percentage point in combined market share to 29.3% for the quarter. And these 3 brands now make up about 92% of the company's total market share.
I'm very pleased to report that Newport's growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter, with the brand share of retail shipments increasing 0.6 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.6% on volume growth of 4.8%. That's testament not just to Newport's expanded retail presence and the superior execution of the R.J. Reynolds' trade marketing team, but also to the inherent equity of the brand. In addition, the company's consumer engagement on Newport is having a positive impact, and that bodes well for the brand in the year ahead. 
R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continue to play key roles in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy and maintained steady performance in the fourth quarter. Camel's retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8%. Pall Mall's market share was down 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter at 7.8%, while the brand has remained stable for the past 3 quarters despite R.J. Reynolds seeing uptrading to premium-priced brands. R.J. Reynolds' consumer marketing teams have exciting plans for all the drive brands this year. And these equity-building initiatives are expected to further enhance performance.
I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff also delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in the fourth quarter, and it's not hard to see why. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super-premium styles achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continued to make double-digit gain, increasing almost 18.5% for the quarter. At American Snuff, the flagship Grizzly brand continued to outperform the moist snuff industry. Grizzly increased fourth quarter market share by 0.9 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 30.8%. And that was on volume growth of 6.6% compared with the industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter.
All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of all of our operating companies. And I'm confident that they'll continue their strong momentum and find additional opportunities for growth in 2016, allowing RAI to continue to return great value to our shareholders. These accomplishments do not happen by themselves, and I give the credit to our employees for their dedication and hard work. They're changing the game for both RAI and for the industry. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

On many measures, Reynolds American and its operating companies had another outstanding quarter, and that brought our year to a very successful conclusion. 
As Susan said, our companies are making substantial progress. And as a result, the RAI board has approved an increase of 16.7% in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.42 per share or an annualized $1.68. This is consistent with our 75% target payout ratio. The dividend will be payable on April 1 to shareholders of record on March 10. RAI continues to deliver against its commitment to returning value to shareholders and will continue to look for additional opportunities to enhance that value over the long term. 
Now let's turn to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, RAI increased reported EPS by 35.7% from the prior year quarter to $0.19. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.48, up 9.1% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by strong volumes across the board as well as higher pricing. 
Adjusted EPS excludes the following items: a charge of $0.11 per share for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments; a charge of $0.01 per share for implementation costs primarily related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States; a charge of $0.02 per share for tax items; a reduction of $0.17 per share related to the gain on divestiture; a benefit of $0.01 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim; and a onetime benefit of $0.01 per share for the New York NPM settlement. For the full year, RAI's reported EPS was $2.57, and that was up 87.6% from the prior year.
Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.98, up 15.8% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned as well as other items from earlier in the year, namely, transaction-related and financing costs, asset impairment and exit charges and charges for Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. 
RAI's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin came in very strong again, increasing by 4.6 percentage points to 41.2%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. The company's reported operating income was $915 million. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income increased by 66.2% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion, benefiting from Newport's contribution as well as higher cigarette pricing with robust net price realization. For the full year, R.J. Reynolds' reported operating income was $3.4 billion. Full year adjusted operating income increased by just over 43% to $3.8 billion. You can really see R.J. Reynolds' improved performance in its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 4.1 percentage points to 44.6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the year's adjusted operating margin to 44.4%.
R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments were up 34.6% from the prior year quarter, driven by the addition of Newport. I would just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 400 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatively stable and reflects the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also benefited from higher pricing and volume in the fourth quarter. Santa Fe's reported operating income was $112 million. On an adjusted basis, which excludes a onetime benefit of $1 million from the New York NPM settlement, the company's operating income came in at $111 million for the quarter, which was up 22.9%. For the full year, reported operating income was $449 million, while adjusted operating income increased 33.1% to $448 million. Santa Fe's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin gained 1.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 52.8%. For the year, adjusted operating margin came in at 54.8%. So I'm happy to report another strong performance by Santa Fe and its Natural American Spirit brand.
Now let's turn to the strong showing in American Snuff. The company's fourth quarter reported operating income was $133 million, while adjusted operating income rose 18.4% to $134 million. Of course, these adjusted results benefited from higher volume and strong net pricing growth of almost 5%. Adjusted results exclude a $1 million charge for pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, all of which added up to another strong year for American Snuff. Reported operating income rose to $502 million from the prior year, while adjusted operating income increased 13.9% to $503 million. American Snuff's fourth quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 3.3 percentage points to 59.4%. And for the year, adjusted operating margin came to 58.8%.
Before I turn to the Q&A, there are some other important items that I'd like to cover. As you know, we completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. in January for $5 billion. And we're moving quickly on our commitment to deleverage as efficiently as possible while maintaining financial flexibility. To that end, we announced on February 4 a cash tender offer for up to $2.8 billion aggregate cash spent for certain outstanding notes and the redemption of $950 million aggregate principal amount of certain other outstanding notes.
Final details of the tender and redemption will be announced upon completion. Given this progress, we would expect to reach the top end of our target leverage of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of this year. RAI ended the year with total long-term debt of $16.9 billion. And as we've said before, we currently have a very manageable debt portfolio, which will be considerably reduced following the tender and redemption.
At the end of 2015, the company had cash balances of $2.6 billion. And in January, we contributed $325 million to the pension plans to further strengthen the plan's funded status. So based on the achievements in 2015 and our expectations for the year ahead, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $2.25 to $2.35, up 13.6% to 18.7% over last year's adjusted EPS of $1.98.

We obviously think the macroeconomic factors are pointing into the consumers' favor this year as it did in 2015, but we are expecting 2% to 3% decline for next year. With regard to the synergies, the $800 million in synergies that we've talked about continues to be our expectation. We have not identified anything meaningful, positive or negative, that would have us come off of that number at this time. So we certainly are, I would say, a bit ahead of schedule in terms of achieving the synergies, and we hope to achieve those as quickly as we can. As you know, we've incentivized our organization to do that as quickly as possible. But the $800 million continues to be the number. And it is our hope that we can accelerate that throughout the year. The last question you had was on VUSE and, I guess, the investment that we have on vapor. And I'm not sure I have any specifics on that. I think we continue to make great progress. Certainly, the consolidation of the manufacturing facilities that we had in the back half of 2015 was a real positive. It put us on a very good position from a cost basis. We continue to make progress on our cost structure and certain profitability objectives that we have going forward. But a lot of it will depend on how do the innovations -- how are they received by the consumers and how quickly do we look to expand that or not.

I think our view on the volume, in the long term, we've seen 2% to 4% declines in this sector on combustible. And we are taking the view this year that it will be on the low end of that range.

And we saw it both in premium menthol, and we saw it in the non-menthol, particularly the Red style. So I would -- we are crediting that to a couple of things: one, the significantly larger sales force, Reynolds took that brand over in July, August; number two, we started to have our contracts starting to set up from the middle of November. And the first contracts to be converted were the menthol-only contracts, which were previously the strongest Newport outlet. And so we have continued to -- we have seen that acceleration. And certainly, if you compare it historically to Newport's growth, Newport historically got all its growth in market share somehow in the first quarter and then held on. So we -- and this is, of course, the first year we've owned it, and we've only owned it for 2 quarters.

And now another milestone is within sight. We expect Newport's manufacturing integration to be completed by about the middle of this year, well ahead of the 18-month transition that we initially projected. 
In addition, Newport is now far more visible as retailers across the country, as the reset of retail merchandisers is almost complete. And our company's trading consumer marketing engagement has ramped up very well. As you can imagine, this kind of transition has a lot of moving parts. Our employees have made it look easy. But I can assure you, it's been quite an achievement. And they have done it while keeping the rest of the business firmly on track. 
Clearly, Newport has brought a new vitality to the business in what continues to be a competitive and dynamic environment. So in light of our strong performance out of the gate for the year, I'm pleased to report that RAI remains on track earnings growth of 13.6% to 18.7% for the year. So that's how we're returning excellent value to our shareholders. 
And now I'd like to briefly recap some other highlights from the quarter. RAI successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. and followed that with an early repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding debt. We also increased our quarterly cash dividend by more than 16% and created a new subsidiary called RAI Innovations Company to drive speed-to-market of leading-edge products. Innovation is a key part of our strategy to transform the tobacco industry, and it's a core competitive strength for our company, especially R.J. Reynolds vapor. It's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continue to make headway in the first quarter and the brand remains the leader in traditional tobacco channels. In fact, VUSE is about 3x the size of its nearest competitor in those channels, and the brand just been ranked at the top of 2015 most successful new products in convenience stores. VUSE is now available in almost 115,000 stores. In recent months, the brand rolled out 2 more formats online. VUSE Connect and VUSE and work continues on the development of the Port Port and Pro format. We will keep you posted on the timing of those innovations in the month ahead. 
At Niconovum USA, progress continues to be made with the national expansion of the Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum. Zonnic is now in about 33,000 stores and is targeting further expansion this year. The brand is just introduced 4 styled in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains and plans to roll out a 10-count mini in the summer. 
Moving on to our operating company's performance. I would first just note a change in the retail market share reporting. RAI's operating companies, cigarette and moist snuff shipments to retail market shares have been revised to reflect the new universe of direct customers following the Lorillard acquisition. This revision resulted in slightly higher absolute share levels in 2015 on some of our operating companies brand, but does not affect overall share trend. Prior year market share data has been restated on this basis for comparison purposes. 
Now let's start with combustible. Total first quarter cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 34.2% from the prior year quarter, a caparison that reflects Newport's contribution. Improved economic factors such as lower gas prices continued to benefit the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers in the quarter and that drove industry cigarette volume higher by 4/10 of a percent. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were relatively flat. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 3/10 of a percentage points from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their drive brands adding half a percentage point to 32%. These brands now make up about 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share. 
Of course, the growth in Newport help strong first quarter at our R.J. Reynolds in addition to higher volumes in pricing. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 32.5%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brand Newport, Camel and Pall Mall added 2/10 of a percentage point in combined market share bringing that to 30% for the quarter. Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand continued to show accelerant momentum, increasing share of retail shipments by another 6/10 of percentage point from the prior year quarter to 14% and that was on volume growth of 3.4%. 
Increased distribution, merchandising and productive visibility is having a positive impact on the brand, as is the increased engagement with adult tobacco consumers. Newport launched a Payday Everyday integrated national campaign in March and that's adding some excitement to the brand. And for the first time in many years for Newport, brand ambassadors are now engaging with franchise and competitive adult tobacco consumers across the nation. Equity building initiatives also continue on R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brands, Camel and Pall Mall, which continue to play their key role in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy. 
In the first quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at 8.2%. I would note that Camel had an especially strong first quarter last year, and even with this tough comparison, the brand is performing well and with up a 10th of a share point on a sequential basis. 
Pall Mall's first quarter retail market share was down 3/10 of a percentage points versus prior year at 7.8% as we continue to see consumers move up to premium brands, but the brand has remained relatively stable since the second quarter of last year and it remains the nation's largest value brand. I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff not the ball-out-of-the-park this quarter both financially and in the marketplace. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive superpremium styles achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continue to make double-digit gains, increasing by just over 22% in the quarter. 
And at American Snuff, their flagship Grizzly brand delivered first quarter retail market share of 30.8%, up 4/10 of a percentage point. Grizzly is advancing its leadership position in the growing pouch style and recent promotions have focused on the brand's differentiation and superior quality to increase awareness in trial. For American Snuff overall, first quarter moist snuff market share was 33.4%, that was on volume growth of 3.3% compared to moist snuff industry growth of about 5%. 
I would point out that industry growth was up on the national expansion of competitive line extension. So that's a wrap up of very successful first quarter. RAI and our operating companies are off to a great start this year. Newport's integration is ahead of schedule, and we're well positioned for solid growth in the months ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter, and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by abo",907,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter, and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by about 592% from the prior year quarter to $2.49. This was driven primarily by the gain on the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States. 
On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was $0.50, up 16.3% from the prior year quarter benefiting from higher volumes and pricing across the board. Adjusted EPS excludes the following items: A gain of $2.11 for the divestiture of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S., a charge of $0.11 per share for debt in financing cost and a charge of $0.01 per share primarily related to the implementation cost following the Lorillard acquisition in the sale of Natural American Spirit's business overseas. 
RAI's first quarter adjusted operating margin was outstanding, increasing by 8 percentage points to more than 45%. To add some perspective on the impact of the Lorillard acquisition and other recent efficiency initiatives that we driven internally, I point out that our adjusted operating margin has increased by more than 10 percentage points at this time 2 years ago. 
Now let's turn to our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds' continued its impressive run in the quarter, increasing reported operating income by more than 88% to about $1.1 billion. The company benefited significantly from Newport's contribution as well as robust net price realization. 
On an adjusted basis, the company's first quarter operating income increased by 73.8% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion. This excludes charges of $13 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $1 million for implementation costs. Once again, R.J. Reynolds improved performance and its adjusted operating margin, which jumped by 6.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 46.5%, as R.J. Reynolds' mix of premium cigarettes increased significantly. A strong positive factor behind these results was R.J. Reynolds' first quarter cigarette shipments, which increased by just over 35% from the prior year quarter driven by the addition of Newport. I'd just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.2 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 700 million from the prior year quarter. 
R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatively stable sequentially and continue to reflect the normalized level of new cigarette portfolio. 
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also continue to benefit from higher pricing and volume on it's super-premium brand, Natural American Spirit. Santa Fe accelerated its first quarter operating income by 33.2% to $123 million. And that translated into a substantial gain in the company's operating margin, which grew by 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 56.4%. I'm pleased to report that American Snuff also powered ahead. The company's first quarter operating income of $133 million reflected an increase of almost 12% from the prior year quarter. And for the first time, American Snuff's operating margin passed a 60% mark coming in at 61.3%, which was up nearly 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, I'd like to cover some other important events that occurred in the quarter that demonstrate our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 16.7% and completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. for approximately $5 billion. And we also moved quickly to deleverage as we promised. After completing the cash tender offer and redemption of about $3.6 billion, RAI's long-term debt at the end of the quarter stood at $13.2 billion. It carries an average interest rate of 4.9% and an average maturity of 12.6 years. The reduction in interest expense as a result of the reduced level of debt will more than offset the loss of the operating income related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. And as I've said before, we expect to reach the top end of our target leverage up 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA in the back half of this year. 
We remain on track to achieve approximately $800 million in cost synergies as we previously announced. Susan mentioned that we're ahead of schedule on the manufacturing integration, and this has been factored into our earnings guidance. I would also note that at the end of first quarter the company had a cash balance of $4.4 billion. On April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $2.3 billion, which included $597 million paid into the NPM disputed payments account. 
Finally, I'd remind you that we contributed $325 million to the pension plans in January, further strengthening the plan's funded status. So those are the highlights of what was an exceptional quarter for RAI and our operating companies. Based on this success, our expectations for the rest of the year were reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35, which is up 13.6% to 18.7% over the last year's adjusted EPS. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes the items that I mentioned earlier. Thank you all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

So that's not the driver there. But people are trading up to premium, and in some context, that means trading up to combustible. So we feel good about those macros. To your point, we modeled certainly our guidance on a 2% to 3% industry decline. The first quarter was flat on an adjusted basis. As we get into the half, certainly, we are already thinking that that's going to be certainly to the lower end of our anticipated decline. But we will reevaluate that once we get through the half."

So some of that is coming through in our manufacturing environment. We have a number of different initiatives that are aimed at optimizing our processes and operations as well as our supply chain.

As we've said previously, our operating companies entered the new year with strong momentum and that helped to drive an exceptional first quarter for RAI. All of our operating companies continued to deliver against their strategies turning in another excellent performance. Significant positive factors in the quarter were the addition of Newport, higher cigarette and moist snuff volume combined with high pricing and the gain on the divestiture of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States. 
I am especially pleased with the smooth sailing on the integration of Newport. And this success underscores the transformational nature of our acquisition in June last year. Newport has made really impressive gains in market share since then, and it's been a driving force behind the accelerated business performance you see today. And now another milestone is within sight, we expect Newport's manufacturing integration to be completed by about the middle of this year, well ahead of the 18-month transition that we initially projected. In addition, Newport is now far more visible as retailers across the country, as the reset of retail merchandisers is almost complete and our company's trade and consumer marketing engagement has ramped up very well. 
As you can imagine, this kind of transition has a lot of moving parts. Our employees have made it look easy, but I can assure you it's been quite an achievement. And they've done it while keeping the rest of the business firmly on track. Clearly, Newport has brought a new vitality to the business in what continues to be a competitive and dynamic environment. So in light of our strong performance out of the gate for the year, I'm pleased to report that RAI remains on track for earnings growth of 13.6% to 18.7% for the year. So that's how we're returning excellent value to our shareholders. 
And now I'd like to briefly recap some other highlights from the quarter. RAI successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. and followed that with an early repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding debt. We also increased our quarterly cash dividend by more than 16% and created a new subsidiary called RAI Innovations Company to drive speed-to-market of leading-edge products. 
Innovation is a key part of our strategy to transform the tobacco industry and it's a core competitive strength for our company, especially at R.J. Reynolds Vapor. Its VUSE digital vapor cigarette continues to make headway in the first quarter and the brand remains the leader in traditional tobacco channels. In fact, VUSE is about 3x the size of its nearest competitor in those channels, and the brand just been ranked at the top of 2015 most successful new products in convenience stores. VUSE is now available in almost 115,000 stores. In recent months the brand rolled out 2 more formats online, VUSE Connect and VUSE Fob, and work continues on the development of the Port and Pro format. We will keep you posted on the timing of those innovations in the months ahead. 
At Niconovum USA, progress continues to be made with the national expansion of the Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum. Zonnic is now in about 33,000 stores and is targeting further expansion this year. The brand has just introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains and plans to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in the summer. 
Moving on to our operating company's performance, I would first just note a change in the retail market share reporting. RAI's operating companies, cigarette and moist snuff shipments to retail market shares have been revised to reflect the new universe of direct customers following the Lorillard acquisition. This revision results in slightly higher absolute share levels in 2015 on some of our operating companies' brand, but does not affect overall share trend. Prior year market share data has been restated on this basis for comparison purposes. 
Now let's start with combustibles. Total first quarter cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 34.2% from the prior year quarter, a comparison that reflects Newport's contribution. Improved economic factors such as lower gas prices continued to benefit the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers in the quarter, and that drove industry cigarette volume higher by 4/10 of a percent. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were relatively flat. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their drive brands adding half a percentage point to 32%. These brands now make up about 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share. 
Of course, the growth in Newport helps fuel the strong first quarter at R.J. Reynolds in addition to higher volumes and pricing. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 32.5%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brand, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 2/10 of a percentage point in combined market share bringing that to 30% for the quarter. Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand continued to show excellent momentum, increasing share of retail shipments by another 6/10 of percentage point from the prior year quarter to 14%, and that was on volume growth of 3.4%. 
Increased distribution, merchandising and product visibility is having a positive impact on the brand, as is the increased engagement with adult tobacco consumers. Newport launched a Payday Everyday integrated national campaign in March, and that's adding some excitement to the brand. And for the first time in many years for Newport, brand ambassadors are now engaging with franchise and competitive adult tobacco consumers across the nation. Equity building initiatives also continue on R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brand, Camel and Pall Mall, which continue to play their key roles in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy. 
In the first quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at 8.2%. I would note that Camel had an especially strong first quarter last year. And even with this tough comparison, the brand is performing well and with up a 10th of a share point on a sequential basis. 
Pall Mall's first quarter retail market share was down 3/10 of a percentage point versus prior year at 7.8%, as we continue to see consumers move up to premium brands. But the brand has remained relatively stable since the second quarter of last year and it remains the nation's largest value brand. 
I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff knock the ball out of the park this quarter, both financially and in the marketplace. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium style achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continue to make double-digit gains, increasing by just over 22% in the quarter. 
And at American Snuff, their flagship Grizzly brand delivered first quarter retail market share of 30.8%, up 4/10 of a percentage point. Grizzly is advancing its leadership position in the growing pouch style, and recent promotions have focused on the brand's differentiation and superior quality to increase awareness in trial. For American Snuff overall, first quarter moist snuff market share was 33.4%, that was on volume growth of 3.3% compared to moist snuff industry growth of about 5%. I would point out that industry growth was up on the national expansion of competitive line extensions. 
So that's a wrap up of very successful first quarter. RAI and our operating companies are off to a great start this year, Newport's integration is ahead of schedule and we're well positioned for solid growth in the months ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by abou",910,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by about 592% from the prior year quarter to $2.49. This was driven primarily by the gain on the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States. 
On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was $0.50, up 16.3% from the prior year quarter benefiting from higher volumes and pricing across the board. Adjusted EPS excludes the following items: A gain of $2.11 for the divestiture of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S., a charge of $0.11 per share for debt in financing cost and a charge of $0.01 per share primarily related to the implementation cost following the Lorillard acquisition and the sale of Natural American Spirit's business overseas. 
RAI's first quarter adjusted operating margin was outstanding, increasing by 8 percentage points to more than 45%. To add some perspective on the impact of the Lorillard acquisition and other recent efficiency initiatives that we've driven internally, I'd point out that our adjusted operating margin has increased by more than 10 percentage points since this time 2 years ago. 
Now let's turn to our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds' continued its impressive run in the quarter, increasing reported operating income by more than 88% to about $1.1 billion. The company benefited significantly from Newport's contribution as well as robust net price realization. 
On an adjusted basis, the company's first quarter operating income increased by 73.8% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion. This excludes charges of $13 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $1 million for implementation costs. Once again, R.J. Reynolds improved performance in its adjusted operating margin, which jumped by 6.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 46.5% as R.J. Reynolds' mix of premium cigarettes increased significantly. A strong positive factor behind these results was R.J. Reynolds' first quarter cigarette shipments, which increased by just over 35% from the prior year quarter driven by the addition of Newport. 
I would just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.2 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 700 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatively stable sequentially and continue to reflect the normalized level of new cigarette portfolio. 
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also continue to benefit from higher pricing and volume on its super premium brand, Natural American Spirit. Santa Fe accelerated its first quarter operating income by 33.2% to $123 million, and that translated into a substantial gain in the company's operating margin which grew by 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 56.4%. 
I'm pleased to report that American Snuff also powered ahead. The company's first quarter operating income of $133 million reflected an increase of almost 12% from the prior year quarter. And for the first time, American Snuff's operating margin passed the 60% mark coming in at 61.3%, which was up nearly 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, I'd like to cover some other important events that occurred in the quarter that demonstrate our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 16.7% and completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. for approximately $5 billion. And we also moved quickly to deleverage as we promised. After completing the cash tender offer and redemption of about $3.6 billion, RAI's long-term debt at the end of the quarter stood at $13.2 billion. It carries an average interest rate of 4.9% and an average maturity of 12.6 years. The reduction in interest expense as a result of the reduced level of debt will more than offset the loss of the operating income related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. And as I've said before, we expect to reach the top end of our target leverage up 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA in the back half of this year. 
We remain on track to achieve approximately $800 million in cost synergies as we previously announced. Susan mentioned that we're ahead of schedule on the manufacturing integration, and this has been factored in to our earnings guidance. I would also note that at the end of first quarter, the company had a cash balance of $4.4 billion. On April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $2.3 billion, which included $597 million paid into the NPM disputed payments account. Finally, I'd remind you that we contributed $325 million to the pension plans in January, further strengthening the plan's funded status. 
So those are the highlights of what was an exceptional quarter for RAI and our operating companies. Based on this success, our expectations for the rest of the year were reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35, which is up 13.6% to 18.7% over last year's adjusted EPS. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes the items that I mentioned earlier. 
Thank you all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

So we are pleased with the Camel's performance and we believe that, that will continue to improve. Again, looking at Pall Mall, while Pall Mall was down 3/10 of a share point versus a year ago, basically Pall Mall has been flat since about April last year, and so we feel good about that. I mean, in an environment where consumers are trading up to premium, we don't believe spending a lot of resources to grow value is a good use of resource. And Pall Mall is holding its own and we are making equity investment, and it continues to be the nation's #1 value brand. So we are pleased with both of those brands and I do think that we will see some change in the dynamic as these sets really get up and running, and we'll certainly keep you posted."

To your point, we modeled certainly our guidance on a 2% to 3% industry decline. The first quarter was flat on an adjusted basis.

As we've said previously, our operating companies entered the new year with strong momentum and that helped to drive an exceptional first quarter for RAI. All of our operating companies continued to deliver against their strategies turning in another excellent performance. Significant positive factors in the quarter were the addition of Newport, higher cigarette and moist snuff volume combined with high pricing and the gain on the divestiture of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States. 
I am especially pleased with the smooth sailing on the integration of Newport. And this success underscores the transformational nature of our acquisition in June last year. Newport has made really impressive gains in market share since then, and it's been a driving force behind the accelerated business performance you see today. And now another milestone is within sight, we expect Newport's manufacturing integration to be completed by about the middle of this year, well ahead of the 18-month transition that we initially projected. In addition, Newport is now far more visible at retailers across the country, as the reset of retail merchandisers is almost complete and our company's trade and consumer marketing engagement has ramped up very well. 
As you can imagine, this kind of transition has a lot of moving parts. Our employees have made it look easy, but I can assure you it's been quite an achievement. And they've done it while keeping the rest of the business firmly on track. Clearly, Newport has brought a new vitality to the business in what continues to be a competitive and dynamic environment. So in light of our strong performance out of the gate for the year, I'm pleased to report that RAI remains on track for earnings growth of 13.6% to 18.7% for the year. So that's how we're returning excellent value to our shareholders. 
And now I'd like to briefly recap some other highlights from the quarter. RAI successfully completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. and followed that with an early repayment of a portion of the company's outstanding debt. We also increased our quarterly cash dividend by more than 16% and created a new subsidiary called RAI Innovations Company to drive speed-to-market of leading-edge products. 
Innovation is a key part of our strategy to transform the tobacco industry and it's a core competitive strength for our company, especially at R.J. Reynolds Vapor. Its VUSE digital vapor cigarette continues to make headway in the first quarter and the brand remains the leader in traditional tobacco channels. In fact, VUSE is about 3x the size of its nearest competitor in those channels, and the brand just been ranked at the top of 2015 most successful new products in convenience stores. VUSE is now available in almost 115,000 stores. In recent months the brand rolled out 2 more formats online, VUSE Connect and VUSE Fob, and work continues on the development of the Port and Pro format. We will keep you posted on the timing of those innovations in the months ahead. 
At Niconovum USA, progress continues to be made with the national expansion of the Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum. Zonnic is now in about 33,000 stores and is targeting further expansion this year. The brand has just introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains and plans to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in the summer. 
Moving on to our operating company's performance, I would first just note a change in the retail market share reporting. RAI's operating companies, cigarette and moist snuff shipments to retail market shares have been revised to reflect the new universe of direct customers following the Lorillard acquisition. This revision results in slightly higher absolute share levels in 2015 on some of our operating companies' brand, but does not affect overall share trend. Prior year market share data has been restated on this basis for comparison purposes. 
Now let's start with combustibles. Total first quarter cigarette volumes for RAI's operating companies increased 34.2% from the prior year quarter, a comparison that reflects Newport's contribution. Improved economic factors such as lower gas prices continue to benefit the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers in the quarter, and that drove industry cigarette volume higher by .4%. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were relatively flat. Total cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased  3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their drive brands adding .5 a percentage point to 32%. These brands now make up about 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share. 
Of course, the growth in Newport helps fuel the strong first quarter at R.J. Reynolds in addition to higher volumes and pricing. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 32.5%. The company's expanded portfolio of drive brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 2/10 of a percentage point in combined market share bringing that to 30% for the quarter. Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand continued to show excellent momentum, increasing share of retail shipments by another 6/10 of percentage point from the prior year quarter to 14%, and that was on volume growth of 3.4%. 
Increased distribution, merchandising and product visibility is having a positive impact on the brand, as is the increased engagement with adult tobacco consumers. Newport launched a Payday Everyday integrated national campaign in March, and that's adding some excitement to the brand. And for the first time in many years for Newport, brand ambassadors are now engaging with franchise and competitive adult tobacco consumers across the nation. Equity building initiatives also continue on R.J. Reynolds' other 2 drive brands, Camel and Pall Mall, which continue to play their key roles in the company's cigarette portfolio strategy. 
In the first quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at 8.2%. I would note that Camel had an especially strong first quarter last year. And even with this tough comparison, the brand is performing well and with up a 1/10 of a share point on a sequential basis. 
Pall Mall's first quarter retail market share was down 3/10 of a percentage point versus prior year at 7.8%, as we continue to see consumers move up to premium brands. But the brand has remained relatively stable since the second quarter of last year and it remains the nation's largest value brand. 
I'm pleased to say that both Santa Fe and American Snuff knocked the ball out of the park this quarter, both financially and in the marketplace. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium style achieved a market share of 2%, which was up by 3/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. Natural American Spirit's volume continued to make double-digit gains, increasing by just over 22% in the quarter. 
And at American Snuff, their flagship Grizzly brand delivered first quarter retail market share of 30.8%, up 4/10 of a percentage point. Grizzly is advancing its leadership position in the growing pouch style, and recent promotions have focused on the brand's differentiation and superior quality to increase awareness and trial. For American Snuff overall, first quarter moist snuff market share was 33.4%, that was on volume growth of 3.3% compared to moist snuff industry growth of about 5%. I would point out that industry growth was up on the national expansion of competitive line extensions. 
So that's a wrap of very successful first quarter. RAI and our operating companies are off to a great start this year, Newport's integration is ahead of schedule and we're well positioned for solid growth in the months ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
399584,330872712,963140,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by abou",909,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As far as financial performance goes, Reynolds American and its operating companies had an impressive quarter and we continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. RAI increased reported EPS by about 592% from the prior year quarter to $2.49. This was driven primarily by the gain on the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the United States. 
On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was $0.50, up 16.3% from the prior year quarter benefiting from higher volumes and pricing across the board. Adjusted EPS excludes the following items: A gain of $2.11 for the divestiture of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S., a charge of $0.11 per share for debt and financing cost and a charge of $0.01 per share primarily related to the implementation cost following the Lorillard acquisition and the sale of Natural American Spirit's business overseas. 
RAI's first quarter adjusted operating margin was outstanding, increasing by 8 percentage points to more than 45%. To add some perspective on the impact of the Lorillard acquisition and other recent efficiency initiatives that we've driven internally, I'd point out that our adjusted operating margin has increased by more than 10 percentage points since this time 2 years ago. 
Now let's turn to our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds' continued its impressive run in the quarter, increasing reported operating income by more than 88% to about $1.1 billion. The company benefited significantly from Newport's contribution as well as robust net price realization. 
On an adjusted basis, the company's first quarter operating income increased by 73.8% from the prior year quarter to $1.1 billion. This excludes charges of $13 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $1 million for implementation costs. Once again, R.J. Reynolds improved performance in its adjusted operating margin, which jumped by 6.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 46.5% as R.J. Reynolds' mix of premium cigarettes increased significantly. A strong positive factor behind these results was R.J. Reynolds' first quarter cigarette shipments, which increased by just over 35% from the prior year quarter driven by the addition of Newport. 
I would just note here that wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.2 billion units at the end of the quarter, up about 700 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 2.2 billion remained relatively stable sequentially and continue to reflect the normalized level of new cigarette portfolio. 
Now moving on to Santa Fe, which also continued to benefit from higher pricing and volume on its super premium brand, Natural American Spirit. Santa Fe accelerated its first quarter operating income by 33.2% to $123 million, and that translated into a substantial gain in the company's operating margin which grew by 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 56.4%. 
I'm pleased to report that American Snuff also powered ahead. The company's first quarter operating income of $133 million reflected an increase of almost 12% from the prior year quarter. And for the first time, American Snuff's operating margin passed the 60% mark coming in at 61.3%, which was up nearly 2.5 percentage points from the prior year quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, I'd like to cover some other important events that occurred in the quarter that demonstrate our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 16.7% and completed the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. for approximately $5 billion. And we also moved quickly to deleverage as we promised. After completing the cash tender offer and redemption of about $3.6 billion, RAI's long-term debt at the end of the quarter stood at $13.2 billion. It carries an average interest rate of 4.9% and an average maturity of 12.6 years. The reduction in interest expense as a result of the reduced level of debt will more than offset the loss of the operating income related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's business outside the U.S. And as I've said before, we expect to reach the top end of our target leverage of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA in the back half of this year. 
We remain on track to achieve approximately $800 million in cost synergies as we previously announced. Susan mentioned that we're ahead of schedule on the manufacturing integration, and this has been factored into our earnings guidance. I would also note that at the end of first quarter, the company had a cash balance of $4.4 billion. On April 15, R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $2.3 billion, which included $597 million paid into the NPM disputed payments account. Finally, I'd remind you that we contributed $325 million to the pension plans in January, further strengthening the plan's funded status. 
So those are the highlights of what was an exceptional quarter for RAI and our operating companies. Based on this success, our expectations for the rest of the year were reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35, which is up 13.6% to 18.7% over last year's adjusted EPS. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes the items that I mentioned earlier. 
Thank you all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

Obviously, we are very pleased with Newport up to 14 share points, that's 6/10 versus a year ago. There's also sequential growth, obviously.

And that -- the same goes for Camel and Pall Mall in our context, we spent less resources and the competitive promotional environment was different. This has to do with timing, but the -- as you see in the margin growth, we had an exceptional growth in those margins and we're pleased with those market shares, particularly in the context of that promotional timing and absolute spend. In terms of Newport specifically, we saw growth on both the menthol, which is -- the prominent growth is on menthol.

I mean, in an environment where consumers are trading up to premium, we don't believe spending a lot of resources to grow value is a good use of resource. And Pall Mall is holding its own and we are making equity investment, and it continues to be the nation's #1 value brand.

And I think, we've been very sort of methodical in trying to address those balance sheet metrics. We first hit our pension, as you know. In January, we had $325 million to increase the funded status there. This most recent tender and redemption was a big play for us and certainly got our leverage down into a range. The $500 million we do anticipate paying off at this point, we've reviewed that over the past few months and feel like we're in a good position to move forward with that. And I think as we get into that range, we certainly will be looking at our dividend policy and we will be looking at other ways to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and other opportunities. So nothing really has changed on that front. I think, we're trying to be very methodical in sort of addressing all of these priorities. It's never been a question of one versus the other, it's a matter of how do we sequence this and how we get to a position where we feel good about sort of the long-term plan.

Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers. As you can see from today's report, our transformational acquisition of Lorillard just over a year ago and the steps we've taken since then have greatly enhanced the financial strength of RAI. And we're now at a point where we can deliver on our postacquisition promise to refocus on ways to create even more value for our shareholders. Andrew will discuss our progress on debt reduction and other positive developments shortly, but I do want to highlight our board's approval of an increase in our dividend payout target from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income, with a corresponding increase in our quarterly dividend by 9.5% as well as its authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. These decisions reflect our deep commitment to rewarding shareholders. It's fair to say that these decisions also reflect that confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies business strategies and in their ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in a dynamic environment. 
I'm also very pleased to report that we passed a major milestone in June, the successful completion of the manufacturing integration of the Newport brand much earlier than we initially expected. And Newport continues to outperform our expectations in the marketplace, though all in all, we are very pleased with where we currently sit about 1 year about the Lorillard transaction. In addition to profitable growth in the core businesses, our companies continue to advance their transforming tobacco objectives in other key areas, led by the sinking in energy brought by the team within our new RAI innovations company subsidiary. In particular, RAI Innovations Company is focused on driving our speed to market of leading-edge products like RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette. VUSE remains the category leader with nearly 30% of the market in traditional store channels and the brand plans to expand its of the VUSE style is the next few months. 
Adult tobacco consumers have told us they are interested in new technologies to improve product performance and consumer satisfaction and work continues on enhancing VUSE format with that desire very much in mind. Offering innovative products like VUSE supports our  efforts to lead the transformation of the tobacco industry by providing adult tobacco consumers with superior smoke-free option to consider. As you know, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its final deeming regulations and draft guidance for vapor products on May 5. The agency's product approval guideline will inform our efforts as we consider ways to bring products with the potential to reduce risk to market. In addition, in the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to working with the agency to gain additional clarity on this process. 
With the deeming regulations as a backdrop, our team has been hard at work on new product formats for the VUSE portfolio that will allow RJR Vapor to be fully prepared for the newly-regulated environment. We have long supported reasonable regulation that recognizes the risk continuum and we are committed to working with the agency to establish a regulatory framework that offers the greatest potential to improve public health. 
At Niconovum USA, Zonnic Nicotine Replacement Therapy gum continues to attract positive consumer interest. The brand introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains in the second quarter and has just started to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores. Zonnic is available in about 33,000 retail outlets and we look forward to further national expansion over the rest of this year. 
Now let's turn to the update on performance at our other operating companies, all of which increased profitability in the second quarter. I'll start with combustibles. We continue to see a backdrop of favorable economic factors benefiting the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers, but changes in wholesale inventory levels had a significant impact to industry cigarette volume in the second quarter, which was down by about 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. 
You may recall that in the second quarter of last year, wholesalers took its industry inventory levels up significantly at the time of the Lorillard acquisition. That, coupled with a decrease in inventories in the second quarter of this year, led to an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for the industry. When adjusted for these wholesale inventory changes, industry volume was down about 1.7% for the quarter and was down about 1% for the first half. As we have previously discussed, over time, we would expect cigarette volume declines to return to their historical range of down 2% to 4%. However, we continue to expect the positive macro trend will benefit the cigarette industry throughout 2016 and our current view continues to be that cigarette volumes will be down closer to the 2% end of the range for the full year. 
For RAI's operating companies, total second quarter volume on a pro forma basis was down by about 2.4% from the prior year quarter and when adjusted for wholesale inventory changes was down by about 1.2%. Total second quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 4 tenths of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.5%, with their combined dry brand adding 6 tenths of a percentage points to just over 32%. These dry brands currently make up 93% of our operating companies' total cigarette market share. 
At R.J. Reynolds, the higher volume driven by the addition of Newport as well as higher pricing again generated strong operating performance. The company's second quarter cigarette shipments fell 3.2% from the prior year quarter and again, that is in a pro forma basis. 
Turning to share of market. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds was up slightly in the second quarter at 32.2%. The company's expanded portfolio of dry brands, Newport Camel and Pall Mall, added 3 tenths of a percentage points in combined market share, bringing that to a 29.8% for the quarter. As I said earlier, Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, is demonstrating outstanding momentum and its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts has added greater national visibility to the brand. Newport's pro forma volume in the second quarter was down about 1/2 of 1% versus the prior year and was up about 2% when adjusting for wholesale inventory changes. Newport increased its second quarter retail market share by 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.9%. 
I would note that Newport's market share growth came from both its core menthol style as well as its nonmethol style. Newport's accelerated share growth since it was acquired were R.J. Reynolds has been broad-based across geographies with growth in both its core markets as well as in its opportunity markets. R.J. Reynolds Camel brand is also benefiting from an improved national presence as a result of the expanded retail contract. In the second quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.3%, overcoming the share loss impact from the removal of Camel' style associated with the FDA's net substantially equivalent ruling in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, Camel's share was up 1 tenths of a percentage point when compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an integral and profitable growth in the company's total portfolio strategy. With many adult smokers trading up into premium brands in the current economic environment, the brand's second quarter retail market share was down 2 tenths of a percentage point versus the prior year at 7.7%. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium brand increased retail market share to 2.2%, which is a 4 tenths of a percentage point increase from the prior year quarter, just another great quarter from the fastest-growing premium brand in the industry. And we expect Natural American Spirit momentum will continue to grow through increased consumer engagement and increased awareness of the brand's unique values. 
At American Snuff, Grizzly continues to be the clear leader in the growing pouch category, which now makes up almost 20% of the moist snuff industry and in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor segment. During the second quarter, Grizzly's marketplace and performance was impacted by 2 factors. First, Grizzly Dark styles we're expanded nationally and the second quarter of last year. And second, we saw the national expansion of competitive line extensions in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Grizzly's retail market share declined 7 tenths of a percentage point in the second quarter to 30.6%. Despite the unfavorable comparison dynamics in the second quarter, we continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends. Its truly unique product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth over both the near and long term. 
Looking forward to the third quarter of this year, Grizzly will be expanding its successful Grizzly Dark product line with the rollout of Grizzly Dark Mint, which combines of that differentiated richer and bolder taste of its dark style with the popular mint flavor. 
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first half of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of dry brands and we are clearly delivering on those objectives. And I'm especially pleased by the successful completion of Newport integration and, of course, by the way the brand is driving business performance. We have exciting plans in place for the back half of the year and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

RAI's second quarter reported EPS decline by about 67% from the prior year quarter to $0.56. As you know, this comparison was driven by the substantial gain on divestiture following to Lorillard acquisition last year. On an adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was $0.58, up 13.7% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from the addition of the Newport brand as well as higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.02 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits. For the first half, reported EPS was $3.05, up just over 45% from the prior year period. First half adjusted EPS was $1.08, which was up by almost 15%. These adjusted results also reflect the Engle progeny lawsuits charge as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs. 
RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin continue to grow, increasing 3.8 percentage points to 45.9% and that brought first half adjusted operating margin to 45.6%, up 5.8 percentage points from last year's first half. 
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the second quarter, with reported operating income up by 67.3% at just over $1.2 billion. Of course, Newport's contribution was a major driver of performance, but the company also benefited from solid net price realization compared to the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company's second quarter operating income increased by 52.1% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $48 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs. 
For the first half, reported operating income was $2.3 billion and that was up 76.7% from this time last year. First half adjusted operating income came in at $2.4 billion, a 61.6% increase from last year. R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 47.8%. The company's strong margin improvement was largely driven by the increased mix of premium cigarette volume in addition to strong net pricing and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement. Newport's addition also drove R.J. Reynolds cigarette shipments higher in the second quarter, increasing 25.7% from the prior year quarter. As Susan mentioned, wholesale inventory levels for the industry experienced significant changes compared to the second quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of second quarter this year, which we believe is close to a normalized level. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion at the end of second quarter last year.  At R.J. Reynolds, inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of second quarter remained relatively stable versus the second quarter of last year as well as over the past 4 quarters since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition. 
Given the impact on the quarter, I want to be clear, wholesale inventories for the industry over the course of second quarter 2016 declined by 400 million units, while in last year's second quarter, wholesale inventories increased by 1.1 billion units. Obviously, this dynamic had a positive quarterly impact last year and a negative impact in this year's second quarter, resulting in an exaggerated headline decline of 3.9% for industry volumes. 
Now moving on to Santa Fe where\ solid performance was supported by higher pricing in volume growth of 10.8%. Santa Fe increased its second quarter operating income by just over 7% to $133 million and that brought first half operating income to $256 million. The company experienced higher marketing cost due to timing in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year and this resulted in operating margin of 54.1% for the quarter. 
American Snuff reported another good quarter despite volume declining approximately 0.5% due to the unfavorable comparison which Susan mentioned earlier. The company's second quarter operating income of $138 million was up 7.4% from the prior year quarter and that resulted in first half operating income of $271 million, which was up by 9.5% from the prior-year period. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin came in very strong at 60%, which was up 6 tenth of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. 
Now I'll turn to the additional steps we're taking to return value to our shareholders. First, and update on our long-term debt position. RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account R.J. Reynolds MSA payment of $2.3 billion in April. In line with our previously stated commitment to deleverage as quickly and efficiently as possible, we plan to repay the company's outstanding $500 million bond that matures on August 4 with available cash on hand. We expect us further reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt along with the continued growth in our businesses to now bring the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA in this year's third quarter. 
The timing of this return to our target range is well ahead of our expectations following the Lorillard transaction and provides us the opportunity to consider additional measures for increasing shareholder value. With our improved balance sheet metrics and in line with our previously stated priorities for the use of excess cash, RAI's Board of Directors has approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income. As a result of this new payoff policy, our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.4% to $0.46 per share or an annualized $1.84 per share. The dividend will be payable on October 3 to shareholders registered on September 12. As you know, a strong and growing dividend is an integral part of our commitment to capital returns and we are proud of that we track record we have established in this regard. 
Today's announced dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since completing the Lorillard acquisition last June. This is also the 12th consecutive year of increased dividend payments since RAI was formed in 2004 and represents growth of more than 280% since that time. RAI's board has also approved a 2 billion share repurchase program that scheduled be completed by the end of 2018. All of these actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders, as was the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner. 
Now that we've successfully reached the half year mark, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.26 to $2.34, which is up 14.1% to 18.2% over last year's adjusted EPS. 
Thank you. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

But those will be areas that we just, I think, going forward, we're going to bake into our productivity improvement initiatives and certainly pull that into a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing here to try and get as efficient as we possibly can. So all of that is very positive news for us. We feel very good about the synergies and I think today, we can certainly say that $300 million that we've talked about are there. From a cost standpoint, certainly, across the business, we have somewhat higher cost in second quarter. A lot of that was due to timing, Matt. And I think when you look at our cost for the first half, they were very reflective of cost for the first half of '15.

I would also say, certainly, part of our consideration on this is some costs will be going up in the second half. You're all aware of the deeming regulations and the cost associated with compliance and future innovation under those new rules will certainly be a consideration for us as we go forward. And there are other regulatory issues that obviously we're going to need to deal with in the back half of the year as well that will have some additional higher costs. So all of that has played into our view. We're very pleased with where we are. Obviously, the integration being completed earlier, the synergies coming through really fully from beginning of Q4 and the share repurchase, obviously, will have some impact as well. But I would say the share repurchase will properly be -- we're going to initiate that in third quarter.

And we, as I said earlier, we feel -- we can comfortably say that we're going to achieve that and that will start coming through the P&L fully in fourth quarter. We continue to work on opportunities, I think, to get more efficient. We've talked about these in the past, whether it's procurement, some of the least synergies as well. Those are things will play out over time and quite honestly, will be folded into ongoing and existing programs that we already have to try and optimize our cost base and our structures and so on all the way through. So that is something that will come in over time. It's probably not something that will come in at a single quarter, for example. But we've got the organizations focused on that. They've got significant incentives to continue to try and drive those efficiencies. And I think going forward, that would just essentially come through the P&L in the margin improvement that we have in the company."

Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic",1657,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers. As you can see from today's report, our transformational acquisition of Lorillard just over a year ago and the steps we've taken since then have greatly enhanced the financial strength of RAI. And we're now at a point where we can deliver on our post-acquisition promise to refocus on ways to create even more value for our shareholders. Andrew will discuss our progress on debt reduction and other positive developments shortly. But I do want to highlight our board's approval of an increase in our dividend payout target from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income, with a corresponding increase in our quarterly dividend by 9.5% as well as its authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. These decisions reflect our deep commitment to rewarding shareholders. It's fair to say that these decisions also reflect the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies' business strategies and in their ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in a dynamic environment.
I'm also very pleased to report that we passed a major milestone in June, the successful completion of the manufacturing integration of the Newport brand much earlier than we initially expected. And Newport continues to outperform our expectations in the marketplace, though all in all, we are very pleased with where we currently sit about 1 year after the Lorillard transaction.
In addition to profitable growth in the core businesses, our companies continue to advance their transforming tobacco objectives in other key areas, led by the sinking in energy brought by the team within our new RAI Innovations Company subsidiary. In particular, RAI Innovations Company is focused on driving our speed to market of leading-edge products like RJR Vapor's VUSE Digital Vapor Cigarette. VUSE remains the category leader with nearly 30% of the market in traditional store channels and the brand plans to expand its VUSE style is the next few months.
Adult tobacco consumers have told us they are interested in new technologies to improve product performance and consumer satisfaction, and work continues on enhancing VUSE formats with that desire very much in mind. Offering innovative products like VUSE supports our  efforts to lead the transformation of the tobacco industry by providing adult tobacco consumers with superior smoke-free option to consider. As you know, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its final deeming regulation and draft guidance for vapor products on May 5. The agency's product approval guideline will inform our effort as we consider ways to bring products with the potential to reduce risk to market. In addition, in the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to working with the agency to gain additional clarity on this process.
With the deeming regulations as a backdrop, our team has been hard at work on new product formats for the VUSE portfolio that will allow RJR Vapor to be fully prepared for the newly-regulated environment. We have long supported reasonable regulation that recognizes the risk continuum, and we are committed to working with the agency to establish a regulatory framework that offers the greatest potential to improve public health.
At Niconovum USA, Zonnic Nicotine Replacement Therapy gum continues to attract positive consumer interest. The brand introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains in the second quarter and has just started to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores. Zonnic is available in about 33,000 retail outlets, and we look forward to further national expansion over the rest of this year.
Now let's turn to the update on performance at our other operating companies, all of which increased profitability in the second quarter. I'll start with combustibles. We continue to see a backdrop of favorable economic factors benefiting the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers, but changes in wholesale inventory levels had a significant impact to industry cigarette volume in the second quarter, which was down by about 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter.
You may recall that in the second quarter of last year, wholesalers took its industry inventory levels up significantly at the time of the Lorillard acquisition. That, coupled with a decrease in inventories in the second quarter of this year, led to an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for the industry. When adjusted for these wholesale inventory changes, industry volume was down about 1.7% for the quarter and was down about 1% for the first half. As we have previously discussed, over time, we would expect cigarette volume declines to return to their historical range of down 2% to 4%. However, we continue to expect the positive macro trend will benefit the cigarette industry throughout 2016 and our current view continues to be that cigarette volumes will be down closer to the 2% end of the range for the full year.
For RAI's operating companies, total second quarter volume on a pro forma basis was down by about 2.4% from the prior year quarter, and when adjusted for wholesale inventory changes was down by about 1.2%. Total second quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 4/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.5%, with their combined dry brand adding 6/10 of a percentage point to just over 32%. These dry brands currently make up 93% of our operating companies' total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, the higher volumes driven by the addition of Newport as well as higher pricing, again, generated strong operating performance. The company's second quarter cigarette shipments fell 3.2% from the prior year quarter and again, that is in a pro forma basis.
Turning to share of market. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds was up slightly in the second quarter at 32.2%. The company's expanded portfolio of dry brands, Newport Camel and Pall Mall, added 3/10 of a percentage point in combined market share, bringing that to a 29.8% for the quarter. As I said earlier, Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, is demonstrating outstanding momentum and its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts has added greater national visibility to the brand. Newport's pro forma volume in the second quarter was down about 1/2 of 1% versus the prior year and was up about 2% when adjusting for wholesale inventory changes. Newport increased its second quarter retail market share by 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.9%.
I would note that Newport's market share growth came from both its core menthol style as well as its non-methol style. Newport's accelerated share growth, since it was acquired by R.J. Reynolds, has been broad-based across geographies, with growth in both its core markets as well as in its opportunity markets. R.J. Reynolds Camel brand is also benefiting from an improved national presence as a result of the expanded retail contracts. In the second quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.3%, overcoming the share loss impact from the removal of Camel style associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent ruling in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, Camel's share was up 1/10 of a percentage point when compared with the first quarter of 2016.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an integral and profitable role in the company's total portfolio strategy. With many adult smokers trading up into premium brands in the current economic environment, the brand's second quarter retail market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point versus the prior year at 7.7%. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium brand increased retail market share to 2.2%, which is a 4/10 of a percentage point increase from the prior year quarter, just another great quarter from the fastest-growing premium brand in the industry. And we expect Natural American Spirit momentum will continue to grow through increased consumer engagement and increased awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly continues to be the clear leader in the growing pouch category, which now makes up almost 20% of the moist snuff industry and in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor segment. During the second quarter, Grizzly's marketplace and performance was impacted by 2 factors. First, Grizzly Dark styles were expanded nationally in the second quarter of last year. And second, we saw the national expansion of competitive line extensions in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Grizzly's retail market share declined 7/10 of a percentage point in the second quarter to 30.6%. Despite the unfavorable comparison dynamics in the quarter, we continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends. Its truly unique product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Looking forward to the third quarter of this year, Grizzly will be expanding its successful Grizzly Dark product line with the rollout of Grizzly Dark Mint, which combines the differentiated richer and bolder taste of its dark style with the popular mint flavor.
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievement in the latest quarter and over the first half of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of dry brands, and we are clearly delivering on those objectives. And I'm especially pleased by the successful completion of Newport integration and, of course, by the way the brand is driving business performance. We have exciting plans in place for the back half of the year, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

And that has allowed us to announce significant steps to enhance shareholder value. I'll be discussing those positive developments in more detail shortly, but first, I'll cover our financial results for both periods.
RAI's second quarter reported EPS declined by about 67% from the prior year quarter to $0.56. As you know, this comparison was driven by the substantial gain on divestiture following the Lorillard acquisition last year. On an adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was $0.58, up 13.7% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from the addition of the Newport brand as well as higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.02 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits. For the first half, reported EPS was $3.05, up just over 45% from the prior year period. First half adjusted EPS was $1.08, which was up by almost 15%. These adjusted results also reflect the Engle progeny lawsuits charge as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin continue to grow, increasing 3.8 percentage points to 45.9% and that brought first half adjusted operating margin to 45.6%, up 5.8 percentage points from last year's first half.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the second quarter, with reported operating income up by 67.3% at just over $1.2 billion. Of course, Newport's contribution was a major driver of performance, but the company also benefited from solid net price realization compared to the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company's second quarter operating income increased by 52.1% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $48 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first half, reported operating income was $2.3 billion and that was up 76.7% from this time last year. First half adjusted operating income came in at $2.4 billion, a 61.6% increase from last year. R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 47.8%. The company's strong margin improvement was largely driven by the increased mix of premium cigarette volume in addition to strong net pricing and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement. Newport's addition also drove R.J. Reynolds cigarette shipments higher in the second quarter, increasing 25.7% from the prior year quarter. As Susan mentioned, wholesale inventory levels for the industry experienced significant changes compared to the second quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of second quarter this year, which we believe is close to a normalized level. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion at the end of second quarter last year.  At R.J. Reynolds, inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of second quarter remained relatively stable versus the second quarter of last year as well as over the past 4 quarters since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Given the impact on the quarter, I want to be clear, wholesale inventories for the industry over the course of second quarter 2016 declined by 400 million units, while in last year's second quarter, wholesale inventories increased by 1.1 billion units. Obviously, this dynamic had a positive quarterly impact last year and a negative impact in this year's second quarter, resulting in an exaggerated headline decline of 3.9% for industry volumes.
Now moving on to Santa Fe where solid performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 10.8%. Santa Fe increased its second quarter operating income by just over 7% to $133 million and that brought first half operating income to $256 million. The company experienced higher marketing cost due to timing in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year and this resulted in operating margin of 54.1% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter despite volume declining approximately 0.5% due to the unfavorable comparison, which Susan mentioned earlier. The company's second quarter operating income of $138 million was up 7.4% from the prior year quarter and that resulted in first half operating income of $271 million, which was up by 9.5% from the prior-year period. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin came in very strong at 60%, which was up 6/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. 
Now I'll turn to the additional steps we're taking to return value to our shareholders. First, an update on our long-term debt position. RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account R.J. Reynolds MSA payment of $2.3 billion in April. In line with our previously stated commitment to deleverage as quickly and efficiently as possible, we plan to repay the company's outstanding $500 million bond that matures on August 4 with available cash on hand. We expect this further reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt along with the continued growth in our businesses to now bring the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA in this year's third quarter.
The timing of this return to our target range is well ahead of our expectations following the Lorillard transaction and provides us the opportunity to consider additional measures for increasing shareholder value. With our improved balance sheet metrics and in line with our previously stated priorities for the use of excess cash, RAI's Board of Directors has approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income. As a result of this new payoff policy, our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share or an annualized $1.84 per share. The dividend will be payable on October 3 to shareholders registered on September 12. As you know, a strong and growing dividend is an integral part of our commitment to capital returns, and we are proud of the great track record we have established in this regard.
Today's announced dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since completing the Lorillard acquisition last June. This is also the 12th consecutive year of increased dividend payments since RAI was formed in 2004 and represents growth of more than 280% since that time. RAI's board has also approved a 2 billion share repurchase program that's scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. All of these actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders, as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we've successfully reached the half year mark, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.26 to $2.34, which is up 14.1% to 18.2% over last year's adjusted EPS.

But those will be areas that we just, I think, going forward, we're going to bake into our productivity improvement initiatives and certainly pull that into a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing here to try and get as efficient as we possibly can. So all of that is very positive news for us. We feel very good about the synergies. And I think today, we can certainly say that $300 million that we've talked about are there.

But certainly, timing plays a role in that and certainly had an impact, in some cases, on our comps for second quarter."

I would also say, certainly, part of our consideration on this is some costs will be going up in the second half. You're all aware of the deeming regulations and the cost associated with compliance and future innovation under those new rules will certainly be a consideration for us as we go forward. And there are other regulatory issues that, obviously, we're going to need to deal with in the back half of the year, as well, that will have some additional higher costs. So all of that has played into our view. We're very pleased with where we are. Obviously, the integration being completed earlier, the synergies coming through really fully from beginning of Q4 and the share repurchase, obviously, will have some impact as well.

The demand for that business has never been stronger. Consumers certainly are switching to that brand. I think that brand is -- I got great momentum in the marketplace.

If you go back to the second quarter of last year, we're actually up 7.6 percentage points. The 54.1% is actually more in line with where we've been historically. And I think there's unusual compare there. Some of that certainly was driven by the inventory dynamics, as Susan spoke about, where volumes were up last year, 25% in second quarter and operating income was up almost 50%. So that compare is certainly a component. The other side of that is we also had some additional marketing expense that was really just a matter of timing. I don't think it -- from a full-year basis, I don't think you're seeing anything unique or different there. It's pretty consistent.

Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic",1657,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers. As you can see from today's report, our transformational acquisition of Lorillard just over a year ago and the steps we've taken since then have greatly enhanced the financial strength of RAI. And we're now at a point where we can deliver on our post-acquisition promise to refocus on ways to create even more value for our shareholders. Andrew will discuss our progress on debt reduction and other positive developments shortly. But I do want to highlight our board's approval of an increase in our dividend payout target from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income, with a corresponding increase in our quarterly dividend by 9.5% as well as its authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. These decisions reflect our deep commitment to rewarding shareholders. It's fair to say that these decisions also reflect the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies' business strategies and in their ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in a dynamic environment.
I'm also very pleased to report that we passed a major milestone in June, the successful completion of the manufacturing integration of the Newport brand much earlier than we initially expected. And Newport continues to outperform our expectations in the marketplace, so all in all, we are very pleased with where we currently sit about 1 year after the Lorillard transaction.
In addition to profitable growth in the core businesses, our companies continue to advance their transforming tobacco objectives in other key areas, led by the sinking in energy brought by the team within our new RAI Innovations Company subsidiary. In particular, RAI Innovations Company is focused on driving our speed to market of leading-edge products like RJR Vapor's VUSE Digital Vapor Cigarette. VUSE remains the category leader with nearly 30% of the market in traditional store channels and the brand plans to expand its VUSE style is the next few months.
Adult tobacco consumers have told us they are interested in new technologies to improve product performance and consumer satisfaction, and work continues on enhancing VUSE formats with that desire very much in mind. Offering innovative products like VUSE supports our efforts to lead the transformation of the tobacco industry by providing adult tobacco consumers with superior smoke-free option to consider. As you know, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its final deeming regulation and draft guidance for vapor products on May 5. The agency's product approval guidelines will inform our efforts as we consider ways to bring products with the potential to reduce risk to market. In addition, in the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to working with the agency to gain additional clarity on this process.
With the deeming regulations as a backdrop, our team has been hard at work on new product formats for the VUSE portfolio that will allow RJR Vapor to be fully prepared for the newly-regulated environment. We have long supported reasonable regulation that recognizes the risk continuum, and we are committed to working with the agency to establish a regulatory framework that offers the greatest potential to improve public health.
At Niconovum USA, Zonnic Nicotine Replacement Therapy gum continues to attract positive consumer interest. The brand introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains in the second quarter and has just started to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores. Zonnic is available in about 33,000 retail outlets, and we look forward to further national expansion over the rest of this year.
Now let's turn to the update on performance at our other operating companies, all of which increased profitability in the second quarter. I'll start with combustibles. We continue to see a backdrop of favorable economic factors benefiting the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers, but changes in wholesale inventory levels had a significant impact to industry cigarette volume in the second quarter, which was down by about 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter.
You may recall that in the second quarter of last year, wholesalers took its industry inventory levels up significantly at the time of the Lorillard acquisition. That, coupled with a decrease in inventories in the second quarter of this year, led to an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for the industry. When adjusted for these wholesale inventory changes, industry volume was down about 1.7% for the quarter and was down about 1% for the first half. As we have previously discussed, over time, we would expect cigarette volume declines to return to their historical range of down 2% to 4%. However, we continue to expect the positive macro trend will benefit the cigarette industry throughout 2016 and our current view continues to be that cigarette volumes will be down closer to the 2% end of the range for the full year.
For RAI's operating companies, total second quarter volume on a pro forma basis was down by about 2.4% from the prior year quarter, and when adjusted for wholesale inventory changes was down by about 1.2%. Total second quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 4/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.5%, with their combined dry brand adding 6/10 of a percentage point to just over 32%. These dry brands currently make up 93% of our operating companies' total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, the higher volumes driven by the addition of Newport as well as higher pricing, again, generated strong operating performance. The company's second quarter cigarette shipments fell 3.2% from the prior year quarter and again, that is in a pro forma basis.
Turning to share of market. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds was up slightly in the second quarter at 32.2%. The company's expanded portfolio of dry brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 3/10 of a percentage point in combined market share, bringing that to a 29.8% for the quarter. As I said earlier, Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, is demonstrating outstanding momentum and its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts has added greater national visibility to the brand. Newport's pro forma volume in the second quarter was down about 1/2 of 1% versus the prior year and was up about 2% when adjusting for wholesale inventory changes. Newport increased its second quarter retail market share by 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.9%.
I would note that Newport's market share growth came from both its core menthol style as well as its non-menthol style. Newport's accelerated share growth, since it was acquired by R.J. Reynolds, has been broad-based across geographies, with growth in both its core markets as well as in its opportunity markets. R.J. Reynolds Camel brand is also benefiting from an improved national presence as a result of the expanded retail contracts. In the second quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.3%, overcoming the share loss impact from the removal of Camel style associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent ruling in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, Camel's share was up 1/10 of a percentage point when compared with the first quarter of 2016.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an integral and profitable role in the company's total portfolio strategy. With many adult smokers trading up into premium brands in the current economic environment, the brand's second quarter retail market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point versus the prior year at 7.7%. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium brand increased retail market share to 2.2%, which is a 4/10 of a percentage point increase from the prior year quarter, just another great quarter from the fastest-growing premium brand in the industry. And we expect Natural American Spirit momentum will continue to grow through increased consumer engagement and increased awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly continues to be the clear leader in the growing pouch category, which now makes up almost 20% of the moist snuff industry and in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor segment. During the second quarter, Grizzly's marketplace and performance was impacted by 2 factors. First, Grizzly Dark styles were expanded nationally in the second quarter of last year. And second, we saw the national expansion of competitive line extensions in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Grizzly's retail market share declined 7/10 of a percentage point in the second quarter to 30.6%. Despite the unfavorable comparison dynamics in the quarter, we continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends. Its truly unique product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Looking forward to the third quarter of this year, Grizzly will be expanding its successful Grizzly Dark product line with the rollout of Grizzly Dark Mint, which combines the differentiated richer and bolder taste of its dark style with the popular mint flavor.
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievement in the latest quarter and over the first half of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of dry brands, and we are clearly delivering on those objectives. And I'm especially pleased by the successful completion of Newport's integration and, of course, by the way the brand is driving business performance. We have exciting plans in place for the back half of the year, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

And that has allowed us to announce significant steps to enhance shareholder value. I'll be discussing those positive developments in more detail shortly, but first, I'll cover our financial results for both periods.
RAI's second quarter reported EPS declined by about 67% from the prior year quarter to $0.56. As you know, this comparison was driven by the substantial gain on divestiture following the Lorillard acquisition last year. On an adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was $0.58, up 13.7% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from the addition of the Newport brand as well as higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.02 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits. For the first half, reported EPS was $3.05, up just over 45% from the prior year period. First half adjusted EPS was $1.08, which was up by almost 15%. These adjusted results also reflect the Engle progeny lawsuits charge as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin continued to grow, increasing 3.8 percentage points to 45.9% and that brought first half adjusted operating margin to 45.6%, up 5.8 percentage points from last year's first half.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the second quarter, with reported operating income up by 67.3% at just over $1.2 billion. Of course, Newport's contribution was a major driver of performance, but the company also benefited from solid net price realization compared to the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company's second quarter operating income increased by 52.1% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $48 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first half, reported operating income was $2.3 billion and that was up 76.7% from this time last year. First half adjusted operating income came in at $2.4 billion, a 61.6% increase from last year. R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 47.8%. The company's strong margin improvement was largely driven by the increased mix of premium cigarette volume in addition to strong net pricing and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement. Newport's addition also drove R.J. Reynolds cigarette shipments higher in the second quarter, increasing 25.7% from the prior year quarter. As Susan mentioned, wholesale inventory levels for the industry experienced significant changes compared to the second quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of second quarter this year, which we believe is close to a normalized level. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of second quarter last year.  At R.J. Reynolds, inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of second quarter remained relatively stable versus the second quarter of last year as well as over the past 4 quarters since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Given the impact on the quarter, I want to be clear, wholesale inventories for the industry over the course of second quarter 2016 declined by 400 million units, while in last year's second quarter, wholesale inventories increased by 1.1 billion units. Obviously, this dynamic had a positive quarterly impact last year and a negative impact in this year's second quarter, resulting in an exaggerated headline decline of 3.9% for industry volumes.
Now moving on to Santa Fe where solid performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 10.8%. Santa Fe increased its second quarter operating income by just over 7% to $133 million and that brought first half operating income to $256 million. The company experienced higher marketing cost due to timing in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year and this resulted in operating margin of 54.1% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter despite volume declining approximately 0.5% due to the unfavorable comparison, which Susan mentioned earlier. The company's second quarter operating income of $138 million was up 7.4% from the prior year quarter and that resulted in first half operating income of $271 million, which was up by 9.5% from the prior-year period. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin came in very strong at 60%, which was up 6/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. 
Now I'll turn to the additional steps we're taking to return value to our shareholders. First, an update on our long-term debt position. RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account R.J. Reynolds MSA payment of $2.3 billion in April. In line with our previously stated commitment to deleverage as quickly and efficiently as possible, we plan to repay the company's outstanding $500 million bond that matures on August 4 with available cash on hand. We expect this further reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt along with the continued growth in our businesses to now bring the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA in this year's third quarter.
The timing of this return to our target range is well ahead of our expectations following the Lorillard transaction and provides us the opportunity to consider additional measures for increasing shareholder value. With our improved balance sheet metrics and in line with our previously stated priorities for the use of excess cash, RAI's Board of Directors has approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income. As a result of this new payoff policy, our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share or an annualized $1.84 per share. The dividend will be payable on October 3 to shareholders registered on September 12. As you know, a strong and growing dividend is an integral part of our commitment to capital returns, and we are proud of the great track record we have established in this regard.
Today's announced dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since completing the Lorillard acquisition last June. This is also the 12th consecutive year of increased dividend payments since RAI was formed in 2004 and represents growth of more than 280% since that time. RAI's board has also approved a $2 billion share repurchase program that's scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. All of these actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders, as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we've successfully reached the half year mark, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.26 to $2.34, which is up 14.1% to 18.2% over last year's adjusted EPS.
Thank you. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

But those will be areas that we just, I think, going forward, we're going to bake into our productivity improvement initiatives and certainly pull that into a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing here to try and get as efficient as we possibly can. So all of that is very positive news for us. We feel very good about the synergies. And I think today, we can certainly say that $300 million that we've talked about are there. From a cost standpoint, certainly, across the business, we have somewhat higher costs in second quarter. A lot of that was due to timing, Matt.

I would also say, certainly, part of our consideration on this is some costs will be going up in the second half. You're all aware of the deeming regulations and the cost associated with compliance and future innovation under those new rules will certainly be a consideration for us as we go forward. And there are other regulatory issues that, obviously, we're going to need to deal with in the back half of the year, as well, that will have some additional higher costs. So all of that has played into our view. We're very pleased with where we are. Obviously, the integration being completed earlier, the synergies coming through really fully from the beginning of Q4 and the share repurchase, obviously, will have some impact as well.

And we, as I said earlier, we feel -- we can comfortably say that we're going to achieve that and that will start coming through the P&L fully in fourth quarter. We continue to work on opportunities, I think, to get more efficient. We've talked about these in the past, whether it's procurement, some of the leaf synergies as well. Those are things will play out over time and quite honestly, will be folded into ongoing and existing programs that we already have to try and optimize our cost base and our structures and so on all the way through. So that is something that will come in over time. It's probably not something that will come in at a single quarter, for example. But we've got the organization focused on that. They've got significant incentives to continue to drive -- to continue to try and drive those efficiencies. And I think going forward, that would just essentially come through the P&L and the margin improvement that we have in the company."

And as he was inquiring about deeming regs, we can also say it really is, as in my prepared remarks, we look forward to working with the agency. Because there have -- a lot of the regs actually read like the combustible. On the other hand, there has been a lot of signaling that this will be a more straightforward process, which is more in line with sort of a risk continuum, risk reduction product arena. So we will continue to work with the agency on clarification of that process."

Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic",1658,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American turned in a strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, supported by continued excellent results across our operating companies as well as a stable and positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers. As you can see from today's report, our transformational acquisition of Lorillard just over a year ago and the steps we've taken since then have greatly enhanced the financial strength of RAI. And we're now at a point where we can deliver on our post-acquisition promise to refocus on ways to create even more value for our shareholders. Andrew will discuss our progress on debt reduction and other positive developments shortly. But I do want to highlight our board's approval of an increase in our dividend payout target from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income, with a corresponding increase in our quarterly dividend by 9.5% as well as its authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. These decisions reflect our deep commitment to rewarding shareholders. It's fair to say that these decisions also reflect the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies' business strategies and in their ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in a dynamic environment.
I'm also very pleased to report that we passed a major milestone in June, the successful completion of the manufacturing integration of the Newport brand much earlier than we initially expected. And Newport continues to outperform our expectations in the marketplace, so all in all, we are very pleased with where we currently sit about 1 year after the Lorillard transaction.
In addition to profitable growth in the core businesses, our companies continue to advance their transforming tobacco objectives in other key areas, led by the sinking in energy brought by the team within our new RAI Innovations Company subsidiary. In particular, RAI Innovations Company is focused on driving our speed to market of leading-edge products like RJR Vapor's VUSE Digital Vapor Cigarette. VUSE remains the category leader with nearly 30% of the market in traditional store channels and the brand plans to expand its VUSE style is the next few months.
Adult tobacco consumers have told us they are interested in new technologies to improve product performance and consumer satisfaction, and work continues on enhancing VUSE formats with that desire very much in mind. Offering innovative products like VUSE supports our efforts to lead the transformation of the tobacco industry by providing adult tobacco consumers with superior smoke-free option to consider. As you know, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its final deeming regulation and draft guidance for vapor products on May 5. The agency's product approval guidelines will inform our efforts as we consider ways to bring products with the potential to reduce risk to market. In addition, in the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to working with the agency to gain additional clarity on this process.
With the deeming regulations as a backdrop, our team has been hard at work on new product formats for the VUSE portfolio that will allow RJR Vapor to be fully prepared for the newly regulated environment. We have long supported reasonable regulation that recognizes the risk continuum, and we are committed to working with the agency to establish a regulatory framework that offers the greatest potential to improve public health.
At Niconovum USA, Zonnic Nicotine Replacement Therapy gum continues to attract positive consumer interest. The brand introduced 4 styles in a 40-count package at 2 retail store chains in the second quarter and has just started to roll out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores. Zonnic is available in about 33,000 retail outlets, and we look forward to further national expansion over the rest of this year.
Now let's turn to the update on performance at our other operating companies, all of which increased profitability in the second quarter. I'll start with combustibles. We continue to see a backdrop of favorable economic factors benefiting the disposable income of adult tobacco consumers, but changes in wholesale inventory levels had a significant impact to industry cigarette volume in the second quarter, which was down by about 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter.
You may recall that in the second quarter of last year, wholesalers took its industry inventory levels up significantly at the time of the Lorillard acquisition. That, coupled with a decrease in inventories in the second quarter of this year, led to an unfavorable year-over-year comparison for the industry. When adjusted for these wholesale inventory changes, industry volume was down about 1.7% for the quarter and was down about 1% for the first half. As we have previously discussed, over time, we would expect cigarette volume declines to return to their historical range of down 2% to 4%. However, we continue to expect the positive macro trend will benefit the cigarette industry throughout 2016 and our current view continues to be that cigarette volumes will be down closer to the 2% end of the range for the full year.
For RAI's operating companies, total second quarter volume on a pro forma basis was down by about 2.4% from the prior year quarter, and when adjusted for wholesale inventory changes was down by about 1.2%. Total second quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 4/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 34.5%, with their combined dry brand adding 6/10 of a percentage point to just over 32%. These dry brands currently make up 93% of our operating companies' total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, the higher volumes driven by the addition of Newport as well as higher pricing, again, generated strong operating performance. The company's second quarter cigarette shipments fell 3.2% from the prior year quarter and again, that is in a pro forma basis.
Turning to share of market. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds was up slightly in the second quarter at 32.2%. The company's expanded portfolio of dry brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 3/10 of a percentage point in combined market share, bringing that to a 29.8% for the quarter. As I said earlier, Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, is demonstrating outstanding momentum and its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts has added greater national visibility to the brand. Newport's pro forma volume in the second quarter was down about 1/2 of 1% versus the prior year and was up about 2% when adjusting for wholesale inventory changes. Newport increased its second quarter retail market share by 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.9%.
I would note that Newport's market share growth came from both its core menthol style as well as its non-menthol style. Newport's accelerated share growth, since it was acquired by R.J. Reynolds, has been broad-based across geographies, with growth in both its core markets as well as in its opportunity markets. R.J. Reynolds Camel brand is also benefiting from an improved national presence as a result of the expanded retail contracts. In the second quarter, Camel's retail cigarette market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.3%, overcoming the share loss impact from the removal of Camel style associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent ruling in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, Camel's share was up 1/10 of a percentage point when compared with the first quarter of 2016.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an integral and profitable role in the company's total portfolio strategy. With many adult smokers trading up into premium brands in the current economic environment, the brand's second quarter retail market share was down 2/10 of a percentage point versus the prior year at 7.7%. At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive super premium brand increased retail market share to 2.2%, which is a 4/10 of a percentage point increase from the prior year quarter, just another great quarter from the fastest-growing premium brand in the industry. And we expect Natural American Spirit momentum will continue to grow through increased consumer engagement and increased awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly continues to be the clear leader in the growing pouch category, which now makes up almost 20% of the moist snuff industry and in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor segment. During the second quarter, Grizzly's marketplace and performance was impacted by 2 factors. First, Grizzly Dark styles were expanded nationally in the second quarter of last year. And second, we saw the national expansion of competitive line extensions in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Grizzly's retail market share declined 7/10 of a percentage point in the second quarter to 30.6%. Despite the unfavorable comparison dynamics in the quarter, we continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends, its truly unique product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Looking forward to the third quarter of this year, Grizzly will be expanding its successful Grizzly Dark product line with the rollout of Grizzly Dark Mint, which combines the differentiated richer and bolder taste of its dark style with the popular mint flavor.
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievement in the latest quarter and over the first half of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of dry brands, and we are clearly delivering on those objectives. And I'm especially pleased by the successful completion of Newport's integration and, of course, by the way the brand is driving business performance. We have exciting plans in place for the back half of the year, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

And that has allowed us to announce significant steps to enhance shareholder value. I'll be discussing those positive developments in more detail shortly, but first, I'll cover our financial results for both periods.
RAI's second quarter reported EPS declined by about 67% from the prior year quarter to $0.56. As you know, this comparison was driven by the substantial gain on divestiture following the Lorillard acquisition last year. On an adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was $0.58, up 13.7% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from the addition of the Newport brand as well as higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.02 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits. For the first half, reported EPS was $3.05, up just over 45% from the prior year period. First half adjusted EPS was $1.08, which was up by almost 15%. These adjusted results also reflect the Engle progeny lawsuits charge as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's second quarter adjusted operating margin continued to grow, increasing 3.8 percentage points to 45.9% and that brought first half adjusted operating margin to 45.6%, up 5.8 percentage points from last year's first half.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the second quarter, with reported operating income up by 67.3% at just over $1.2 billion. Of course, Newport's contribution was a major driver of performance, but the company also benefited from solid net price realization compared to the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company's second quarter operating income increased by 52.1% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $48 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first half, reported operating income was $2.3 billion and that was up 76.7% from this time last year. First half adjusted operating income came in at $2.4 billion, a 61.6% increase from last year. R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 47.8%. The company's strong margin improvement was largely driven by the increased mix of premium cigarette volume in addition to strong net pricing and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement. Newport's addition also drove R.J. Reynolds cigarette shipments higher in the second quarter, increasing 25.7% from the prior year quarter. As Susan mentioned, wholesale inventory levels for the industry experienced significant changes compared to the second quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 6.9 billion units at the end of second quarter this year, which we believe is close to a normalized level. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of second quarter last year. At R.J. Reynolds, inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of second quarter remained relatively stable versus the second quarter of last year as well as over the past 4 quarters since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Given the impact on the quarter, I want to be clear, wholesale inventories for the industry over the course of second quarter 2016 declined by 400 million units, while in last year's second quarter, wholesale inventories increased by 1.1 billion units. Obviously, this dynamic had a positive quarterly impact last year and a negative impact in this year's second quarter, resulting in an exaggerated headline decline of 3.9% for industry volumes.
Now moving on to Santa Fe where solid performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 10.8%. Santa Fe increased its second quarter operating income by just over 7% to $133 million and that brought first half operating income to $256 million. The company experienced higher marketing cost due to timing in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year and this resulted in operating margin of 54.1% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter despite volume declining approximately 0.5% due to the unfavorable comparison, which Susan mentioned earlier. The company's second quarter operating income of $138 million was up 7.4% from the prior year quarter and that resulted in first half operating income of $271 million, which was up by 9.5% from the prior-year period. American Snuff's second quarter operating margin came in very strong at 60%, which was up 6/10 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. 
Now I'll turn to the additional steps we're taking to return value to our shareholders. First, an update on our long-term debt position. RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account R.J. Reynolds MSA payment of $2.3 billion in April. In line with our previously stated commitment to deleverage as quickly and efficiently as possible, we plan to repay the company's outstanding $500 million bond that matures on August 4 with available cash on hand. We expect this further reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt along with the continued growth in our businesses to now bring the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA in this year's third quarter.
The timing of this return to our target range is well ahead of our expectations following the Lorillard transaction and provides us the opportunity to consider additional measures for increasing shareholder value. With our improved balance sheet metrics and in line with our previously stated priorities for the use of excess cash, RAI's Board of Directors has approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio from 75% to 80% of adjusted net income. As a result of this new payoff policy, our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share or an annualized $1.84 per share. The dividend will be payable on October 3 to shareholders registered on September 12. As you know, a strong and growing dividend is an integral part of our commitment to capital returns, and we are proud of the great track record we have established in this regard.
Today's announced dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since completing the Lorillard acquisition last June. This is also the 12th consecutive year of increased dividend payments since RAI was formed in 2004 and represents growth of more than 280% since that time. RAI's board has also approved a $2 billion share repurchase program that's scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. All of these actions clearly demonstrate our commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating companies' business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we've successfully reached the half year mark, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.26 to $2.34, which is up 14.1% to 18.2% over last year's adjusted EPS.

But those will be areas that we just, I think, going forward, we're going to bake into our productivity improvement initiatives and certainly pull that into a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing here to try and get as efficient as we possibly can. So all of that is very positive news for us. We feel very good about the synergies. And I think today, we can certainly say that $300 million that we've talked about are there. From a cost standpoint, certainly, across the business, we have somewhat higher costs in second quarter. A lot of that was due to timing, Matt. And I think when you look at our cost for the first half, they were very reflective of cost for the first half of '15. But certainly, timing plays a role in that and certainly had an impact, in some cases, on our comps for second quarter."

I would also say, certainly, part of our consideration on this is some costs will be going up in the second half. You're all aware of the deeming regulations and the cost associated with compliance and future innovation under those new rules will certainly be a consideration for us as we go forward. And there are other regulatory issues that, obviously, we're going to need to deal with in the back half of the year, as well, that will have some additional higher costs. So all of that has played into our view. We're very pleased with where we are. Obviously, the integration being completed earlier, the synergies coming through really fully from the beginning of Q4 and the share repurchase, obviously, will have some impact as well. But I would say the share repurchase will properly be -- we're going to initiate that in third quarter. That will start in third quarter, but will probably have the bigger impact in fourth quarter and going forward."

If you go back to the second quarter of last year, we're actually up 7.6 percentage points. The 54.1% is actually more in line with where we've been historically. And I think there's unusual compare there. Some of that certainly was driven by the inventory dynamics, as Susan spoke about, where volumes were up last year, 25% in second quarter and operating income was up almost 50%. So that compare is certainly a component. The other side of that is we also had some additional marketing expense that was really just a matter of timing. I don't think it -- from a full-year basis, I don't think you're seeing anything unique or different there. It's pretty consistent.

Well, we do have plenty of news today, don't we?

Hello, everyone. Well, we do have plenty of news today, don't we? But before I speak to the upcoming changes in leadership here, let me touch on a few of the quarter's business highlights.
First, our operating performance continued to be excellent, especially in light of the significant investments in our company's regulatory compliance, innovation pipeline and participation in current state political processes. In addition, both Newport and Natural American Spirit made another impressive showing in the marketplace. And together, with higher pricing in both cigarettes and moist snuff, these premium brands were a key driver behind RAI's strong earnings growth for the third quarter and the first 9 months.
Over the course of the year, we've also accelerated returns to our shareholders. And I'd remind you here of our significant debt reduction, 2 dividend increases and RAI's new share repurchase program. So I'm very pleased with the way this year has progressed. And with Newport's integration now behind us, this is an appropriate time to lay out our leadership succession plans.
As we announced today, I will become Executive Chairman of RAI on the 1st of January, and Debra will succeed me as President and CEO. Yes, I really am retiring as CEO this time, and I've assured my husband there will be no round 3. But I'm fully committed to making a seamless and successful transition with Debra over the next few months. And as board chair, I look forward to play an integral role in RAI's future success.
Not only is this the right time for a transition to new roles, but Debra is absolutely the right person to lead RAI and its companies to the next level. Debra has years of experience and leadership in the consumer products industry, and she has made a significant impact since joining R.J. Reynolds 2 years ago, playing a critical role in Newport's integration into our company's portfolio and helping to drive innovation throughout RAI's businesses. Debra and I have worked closely over the past 2 years, and I am confident that Debra will successfully build upon the strong foundation for our businesses that we have formed together following the Lorillard acquisition.
I also want to welcome Joseph Fragnito from the Kraft Heinz Company to RAI's leadership team. Joe, an experienced brand marketeer and innovator, will take over as R.J. Reynolds' President and Chief Commercial Officer next week. He will be giving you a full update on our plans to continue growing our businesses and advancing our transforming tobacco agenda at our Investment Day event in November.
So for now, I'll hand over to Debra for more details on our third quarter report."

It's great to be here, and I'm excited to be given the opportunity to play a bigger role in RAI's ongoing success. It's been a true pleasure over the past 2 years working with our talented team, gaining a deep understanding of the tobacco industry as well as directly contributing to the success of our strong businesses and powerful brands.
I'd also like to welcome Joe and his expertise and experience to our team. From his work at Kraft Heinz, he knows how to run effective and efficient business units, in addition to his experience in consumer packaged goods. Joe also comes to R.J. Reynolds with a strong track record of bringing brand innovations to market, which will serve the company well moving forward.
In addition to working closely with Susan on the CEO transition, I and the rest of the leadership team look forward to working closely with Joe as we continue to build our company's businesses and execute upon our successful strategies now in place.
Now let's turn to our operating company's results. I'm sure you've all read our earnings report, so I just like to touch on the third quarter highlights and key takeaways. I'll start with combustibles.
We continued to see a positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers in the third quarter. But we are now lapping the impact of those positive tailwinds on industry cigarette volumes, and we are seeing industry volumes returning to a more normal rate of decline.
On an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes declined by about 3.4% for the quarter and about 1.8% for the first 9 months. Given this, our current view for the full year is that cigarette volumes will be down around 2.5%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect cigarette volume declines to track within their historical range of down 2% to 4%.
For RAI's operating companies, total third quarter cigarette volume was down by 1.5% from the prior year quarter and wholesale inventory changes did not have a significant impact on our operating companies in the quarter. Total third quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their combined drive brands adding 0.4 percentage points to 32.2%. And these drive brands currently make up 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, third quarter cigarette shipments fell by 2.5% from the prior year quarter. And after adjusting for wholesale inventory movements, R.J. Reynolds' third quarter shipments declined by about 2.7%. And again, that was versus the industry adjusted decline of about 3.4%. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds in the third quarter was in line compared to the third quarter of last year at 32.3%.
Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, continues to demonstrate outstanding momentum following its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts over the past year. Newport's volume in the third quarter was up about 1% versus the prior year and was not significantly impacted by wholesale inventory changes. We were also very pleased with Newport's continued strength at retail as the brand increased its third quarter retail market share by 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.9%. I would note that we continue to see Newport's market share growth coming across all geographies and from both its core menthol styles as well as its non-menthol styles.
R.J. Reynolds Camel brand also continues to benefit from an improved national presence resulting from expanded retail contracts, offset by the impact from the removal of Camel styles associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent decision in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, Camel's third quarter retail cigarette market share was down 0.1 share points versus the prior year quarter at 8.3%. However, since the FDA decision last year, we have been very pleased that Camel has steadily grown market share from 8.1% to the 8.3% we saw in the third quarter. And R.J. Reynolds has exciting plans for the Camel Turkish family aimed at building the brand's equity and growing Camel's market share. We will be providing more detail in that regard at our upcoming Investor Day presentation in New York next month.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an important role in the company's total portfolio strategy. And we are very pleased by its increasing profitability and contribution to the bottom line. In the current environment, with many adult smokers trading up into premium brands, Pall Mall's third quarter retail market share was down 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year but was in line with the second quarter of this year at 7.7%.
And [ph] Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive premium brand, continues to outperform. In the third quarter, the brand increased retail market share to 2.3%, which is an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. And looking forward, we expect continued growth from Natural American Spirit as the brand benefits from increased consumer engagement and growing awareness of of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly's Dark Mint, which combines the richer and bolder taste of its dark styles with the popular mint flavor, was successfully expanded nationally late in the third quarter. The differentiated Dark Mint style has been very well received by consumers and should continue to benefit Grizzly going forward.
Grizzly's retail market share of 30.7% in the third quarter was up 0.2 percentage points sequentially and declined by 0.4 percentage points compared to a very strong third quarter of last year. Grizzly also continues to lead the growing pouch category, which now makes up more than 20% of of the moist snuff industry, and the brand is the clear leader in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor category. We continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends, its authentic product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Before we move on to Andrew, I'll give you a quick update on RAI innovations in [ph] its subsidiaries, which are working hard on their mission to redefine the vapor category. RJR Vapor, whose VUSE digital vapor cigarettes continue to grow volume and lead the category with market share more than 3x its closest competitor in traditional retail channels, will expand availability of VUSE VIBE next month. VIBE, an exciting new format for the VUSE family of products, is a high-capacity, closed-cartridge tank system with a rechargeable battery. VIBE offers more liquid than the brand's previous products and also has a more powerful and longer-lasting battery. So it meets the desires we heard from adult tobacco consumers to combine the ease of use of a cigalike product with the performance of a tank system.
In the third quarter, RAI Innovations invested significantly in a variety of vapor platforms as well as in the regulatory support behind them. And you'll hear more about the company's innovations pipeline in the coming months.
Niconovum's Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum also continues to perform well. As you know, the brand rolled out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores in the third quarter, and this style is now available in about 19,000 outlets.
That's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first 9 months of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of drive brands. And we are on plan against those objectives. We also have exciting plans in place to further build upon this success, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.

Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.To",1224,"Thank you, Debra, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.
To start off, I'll cover our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. RAI's third quarter reported EPS increased by 30.4% from the prior year quarter to $0.60. As you know, this comparison includes the impact of the implementation and asset impairment costs last year. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.61, up 10.9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.01 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits.
For the first 9 months, reported EPS was $3.65, up 49% from the prior year period. Adjusted EPS over the first 9 months was $1.69, which was up 12.7%. These 9-month adjusted results also reflect charges of $0.03 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 4.1 percentage points to 48.5%, demonstrating the enhanced strength and profitability of our company's businesses. That brought first 9 months adjusted operating margin to 46.6%, up 4.9 percentage points from last year's first 9 months.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results.
R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the third quarter, with reported operating income up by almost 16% at just over $1.3 billion. The company benefited from solid net price realization of 3.9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Please note that R.J. Reynolds' calculated net pricing for the third quarter does include a negative year-over-year impact resulting from the completed reciprocal manufacturing agreement with ITG Brands. Excluding the impact, R.J. Reynolds' net pricing would have been over 5% for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the company's third quarter operating income increased by 8.7% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $25 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first 9 months, reported operating income was $3.6 billion, and that was up 48.6% from this time last year. 9-month adjusted operating income came in at $3.7 billion, a 37.5% increase from last year.
R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.7 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 50.4%, an all-time high for the company. R.J. Reynolds' strong margin improvement in the quarter was largely driven by the net pricing, the synergy realization related to the Lorillard transaction and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement.
As we touched on previously, wholesale inventory levels impacted industry volume declines in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 8.1 billion units at the end of third quarter this year, representing an increase of more than 1.2 billion units during the quarter. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter last year, which remained stable over the course of that quarter. This dynamic helped moderate the industry volume decline to only 1.6% for the third quarter, a number that would adjust down to 3.4% when factoring in the impact of the inventory changes.
At R.J. Reynolds, the inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of third quarter remained relatively stable versus third quarter of last year as well as over each quarter since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, where another quarter of very strong performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 15.7%. Santa Fe increased its third quarter operating income by 27.7% to $154 million, and that brought operating income for the first 9 months to $410 million, up 21.6% over the first 9 months of the prior year. Strong net price realization of 5% in the third quarter drove the company's operating margin up by 2.7 percentage points to 57.9% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter with volume growth of over 2% and net pricing realization of more than 9%. The company's third quarter operating income of $134 million was up 10.9% from the prior year quarter. And that resulted in operating income in the first 9 months of $405 million, which was up by 10% from the prior year period. American Snuff's third quarter operating margin decreased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 57.2%.
So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. Now I'll provide a quick update on our long-term debt position.
RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account the repayment of the company's $500 million bond that matures on August 4. This reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt, along with the continued growth in our businesses, has now brought the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA. I would note here that given the relatively low interest rate outlook, along with our improving interest coverage, the company remains comfortable operating at the higher end of this target leverage range. 
As we discussed last quarter, RAI's board of directors approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio back to 80% of adjusted net income. And our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share, which was paid on October 3. This quarter's dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since we've completed the Lorillard acquisition last June. The company also began to implement its recently announced $2 billion share repurchase program, with repurchases of approximately $75 million of RAI common stock during the quarter. The program is a scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. 
These actions clearly demonstrate the company's commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in operating company's business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner. 
Now that we have reached the 9 month mark for the year, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.27 to $2.33, which is up 14.6% to 17.7% over last year's adjusted EPS. So all in all, we are pleased with how our businesses have performed in the quarter and over the first 9 months. We're also happy to be meeting our growth objectives for the year, particularly given the increased investments in innovation, regulation and state political engagements. 
Thank you all. Now I'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

And also I think one of the things that really pleases us is that the growth we're seeing in both menthol and in non-menthol as well as across all geographies. So we're still seeing that. Of course, we are starting to lap the stronger performance that we had last year. So I think that the deceleration in growth, I think, that you're seeing as really kind of a lapping of stronger performance of prior year as well. I think as far as price gap management pricing, the question there, pricing within the quarter was in line with where we've seen it. We did not add or take away any promotional spending, it was about on kind of average of where we've been. So there hasn't been any changes there on Newport."

So obviously with volumes, we have seen a significant shift in volumes, I think, throughout the year. It's been relatively consistent with where we've been from a plan standpoint. We talked about 2% at the beginning of the year. I think right now, best estimate is between 2% and 2.5%. That's probably a good view. But obviously, we still have 1 quarter to go and we'll see how that plays out. But we also have other regulatory costs and we'll have to see how this plays out for the remainder of the quarter.

So from a productivity standpoint, from a synergy standpoint, all of that is certainly adding to our margin improvement and that's an incremental and certainly a sequential sort of improvement that we've seen in the business."

Certainly, regulatory compliance and our state political process engagement, where 2 incremental costs that came through third quarter and certainly we're concentrated in third quarter was some of the things that we were doing. So if you look at that and certainly on a GAAP basis, we have some additional cost on our angle. So that is also coming through in SG&A from a GAAP basis."

Hello, everyone. Well, we do have plenty of news today, don't we? But before I speak to the upcoming changes in leadership here, let me touch on a few of the quarter's business highlights.
First, our operating performance continued to be excellent, especially in light of the significant investments in our company's regulatory compliance, innovation pipeline and participation in current state political processes. In addition, both Newport and Natural American Spirit made another impressive showing in the marketplace. And together, with higher pricing in both cigarettes and moist snuff, these premium brands were a key driver behind RAI's strong earnings growth for the third quarter and the first 9 months.
Over the course of the year, we've also accelerated returns to our shareholders. And I'd remind you here of our significant debt reduction, 2 dividend increases and RAI's new share repurchase program. So I'm very pleased with the way this year has progressed. And with Newport's integration now behind us, this is an appropriate time to lay out our leadership succession plans.
As we announced today, I will become Executive Chairman of RAI on the 1st of January, and Debra will succeed me as President and CEO. Yes, I really am retiring as CEO this time, and I've assured my husband there will be no round 3. But I'm fully committed to making a seamless and successful transition with Debra over the next few months. And as board chair, I look forward to play an integral role in RAI's future success.
Not only is this the right time for a transition to new roles, but Debra is absolutely the right person to lead RAI and its companies to the next level. Debra has years of experience and leadership in the consumer products industry, and she has made a significant impact since joining R.J. Reynolds 2 years ago, playing a critical role in Newport's integration into our company's portfolio and helping to drive innovation throughout RAI's businesses. Debra and I have worked closely over the past 2 years, and I am confident that Debra will successfully build upon the strong foundation for our businesses that we have formed together following the Lorillard acquisition.
I also want to welcome Joseph Fragnito from the Kraft Heinz Company to RAI's leadership team. Joe, an experienced brand marketeer and innovator, will take over as R.J. Reynolds' President and Chief Commercial Officer next week. He will be giving you a full update on our plans to continue growing our businesses and advancing our transforming tobacco agenda at our Investment Day event in November.
So for now, I'll hand over to Debra for more details on our third quarter report."

It's great to be here, and I'm excited to be given the opportunity to play a bigger role in RAI's ongoing success. It's been a true pleasure over the past 2 years working with our talented team, gaining a deep understanding of the tobacco industry as well as directly contributing to the success of our strong businesses and powerful brands.
I'd also like to welcome Joe and his expertise and experience to our team. From his work at Kraft Heinz, he knows how to run effective and efficient business units, in addition to his experience in consumer packaged goods. Joe also comes to R.J. Reynolds with a strong track record of bringing brand innovations to market, which will serve the company well moving forward.
In addition to working closely with Susan on the CEO transition, I and the rest of the leadership team look forward to working closely with Joe as we continue to build our company's businesses and execute upon our successful strategies now in place.
Now let's turn to our operating company's results. I'm sure you've all read our earnings report, so I just like to touch on the third quarter highlights and key takeaways. I'll start with combustibles.
We continued to see a positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers in the third quarter. But we are now lapping the impact of those positive tailwinds on industry cigarette volumes, and we are seeing industry volumes returning to a more normal rate of decline.
On an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes declined by about 3.4% for the quarter and about 1.8% for the first 9 months. Given this, our current view for the full year is that cigarette volumes will be down around 2.5%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect cigarette volume declines to track within their historical range of down 2% to 4%.
For RAI's operating companies, total third quarter cigarette volume was down by 1.5% from the prior year quarter and wholesale inventory changes did not have a significant impact on our operating companies in the quarter. Total third quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their combined drive brands adding 0.4 percentage points to 32.2%. And these drive brands currently make up 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, third quarter cigarette shipments fell by 2.5% from the prior year quarter. And after adjusting for wholesale inventory movements, R.J. Reynolds' third quarter shipments declined by about 2.7%. And again, that was versus the industry adjusted decline of about 3.4%. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds in the third quarter was in line compared to the third quarter of last year at 32.3%.
Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, continues to demonstrate outstanding momentum following its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts over the past year. Newport's volume in the third quarter was up about 1% versus the prior year and was not significantly impacted by wholesale inventory changes. We were also very pleased with Newport's continued strength at retail as the brand increased its third quarter retail market share by 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.9%. I would note that we continue to see Newport's market share growth coming across all geographies and from both its core menthol styles as well as its non-menthol styles.
R.J. Reynolds Camel brand also continues to benefit from an improved national presence resulting from expanded retail contracts, offset by the impact from the removal of Camel styles associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent decision in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, Camel's third quarter retail cigarette market share was down 0.1 share points versus the prior year quarter at 8.3%. However, since the FDA decision last year, we have been very pleased that Camel has steadily grown market share from 8.1% to the 8.3% we saw in the third quarter. And R.J. Reynolds has exciting plans for the Camel Turkish family aimed at building the brand's equity and growing Camel's market share. We will be providing more detail in that regard at our upcoming Investor Day presentation in New York next month.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an important role in the company's total portfolio strategy. And we are very pleased by its increasing profitability and contribution to the bottom line. In the current environment, with many adult smokers trading up into premium brands, Pall Mall's third quarter retail market share was down 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year but was in line with the second quarter of this year at 7.7%.
At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive premium brand continues to outperform. In the third quarter, the brand increased retail market share to 2.3%, which is an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. And looking forward, we expect continued growth from Natural American Spirit as the brand benefits from increased consumer engagement and growing awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly's Dark Mint, which combines the richer and bolder taste of its dark styles with the popular mint flavor, was successfully expanded nationally late in the third quarter. The differentiated Dark Mint style has been very well received by consumers and should continue to benefit Grizzly going forward.
Grizzly's retail market share of 30.7% in the third quarter was up 0.2 percentage points sequentially and declined by 0.4 percentage points compared to a very strong third quarter of last year. Grizzly also continues to lead the growing pouch category, which now makes up more than 20% of the moist snuff industry, and the brand is the clear leader in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor category. We continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends, its authentic product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Before we move on to Andrew, I'll give you a quick update on RAI Innovations and its subsidiaries, which are working hard on their mission to redefine the vapor category. RJR Vapor, whose VUSE digital vapor cigarettes continue to grow volume and lead the category with market share more than 3x its closest competitor in traditional retail channels, will expand availability of VUSE VIBE next month. VIBE, an exciting new format for the VUSE family of products, is a high-capacity, closed-cartridge tank system with a rechargeable battery. VIBE offers more liquid than the brand's previous products and also has a more powerful and longer-lasting battery. So it meets the desires we heard from adult tobacco consumers to combine the ease of use of a cigalike product with the performance of a tank system.
In the third quarter, RAI Innovations invested significantly in a variety of vapor platforms as well as in the regulatory support behind them. And you'll hear more about the company's innovations pipeline in the coming months.
Niconovum's Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum also continues to perform well. As you know, the brand rolled out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores in the third quarter, and this style is now available in about 19,000 outlets.
That's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first 9 months of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of drive brands. And we are on plan against those objectives. We also have exciting plans in place to further build upon this success, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
399584,403848876,1056848,"Reynolds American Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debra, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.To",1224,"Thank you, Debra, and good morning, everyone. Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.
To start off, I'll cover our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. RAI's third quarter reported EPS increased by 30.4% from the prior year quarter to $0.60. As you know, this comparison includes the impact of the implementation and asset impairment costs last year. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.61, up 10.9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.01 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits.
For the first 9 months, reported EPS was $3.65, up 49% from the prior year period. Adjusted EPS over the first 9 months was $1.69, which was up 12.7%. These 9-month adjusted results also reflect charges of $0.03 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 4.1 percentage points to 48.5%, demonstrating the enhanced strength and profitability of our company's businesses. That brought first 9 months adjusted operating margin to 46.6%, up 4.9 percentage points from last year's first 9 months.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results.
R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the third quarter, with reported operating income up by almost 16% at just over $1.3 billion. The company benefited from solid net price realization of 3.9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Please note that R.J. Reynolds' calculated net pricing for the third quarter does include a negative year-over-year impact resulting from the completed reciprocal manufacturing agreement with ITG Brands. Excluding the impact, R.J. Reynolds' net pricing would have been over 5% for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the company's third quarter operating income increased by 8.7% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $25 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first 9 months, reported operating income was $3.6 billion, and that was up 48.6% from this time last year. 9-month adjusted operating income came in at $3.7 billion, a 37.5% increase from last year.
R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.7 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 50.4%, an all-time high for the company. R.J. Reynolds' strong margin improvement in the quarter was largely driven by the net pricing, the synergy realization related to the Lorillard transaction and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement.
As we touched on previously, wholesale inventory levels impacted industry volume declines in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 8.1 billion units at the end of third quarter this year, representing an increase of more than 1.2 billion units during the quarter. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter last year, which remained stable over the course of that quarter. This dynamic helped moderate the industry volume decline to only 1.6% for the third quarter, a number that would adjust down to 3.4% when factoring in the impact of the inventory changes.
At R.J. Reynolds, the inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of third quarter remained relatively stable versus third quarter of last year as well as over each quarter since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, where another quarter of very strong performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 15.7%. Santa Fe increased its third quarter operating income by 27.7% to $154 million, and that brought operating income for the first 9 months to $410 million, up 21.6% over the first 9 months of the prior year. Strong net price realization of 5% in the third quarter drove the company's operating margin up by 2.7 percentage points to 57.9% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter with volume growth of over 2% and net pricing realization of more than 9%. The company's third quarter operating income of $134 million was up 10.9% from the prior year quarter. And that resulted in an operating income in the first 9 months of $405 million, which was up by 10% from the prior year period. American Snuff's third quarter operating margin decreased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 57.2%.
So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. Now I'll provide a quick update on our long-term debt position.
RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account the repayment of the company's $500 million bond that matured on August 4. This reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt, along with the continued growth in our businesses, has now brought the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA. I would note here that given the relatively low interest rate outlook, along with our improving interest coverage, the company remains comfortable operating at the higher end of this target leverage range.
As we discussed last quarter, RAI's board of directors approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio back to 80% of adjusted net income. And our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share, which was paid on October 3. This quarter's dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since we completed the Lorillard acquisition last June. The company also began to implement its recently announced $2 billion share repurchase program, with repurchases of approximately $75 million of RAI common stock during the quarter. The program is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.
These actions clearly demonstrate the company's commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating company's business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we have reached the 9-month mark for the year, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.27 to $2.33, which is up 14.6% to 17.7% over last year's adjusted EPS.
So all in all, we are pleased with how our businesses have performed in the quarter and over the first 9 months. We're also happy to be meeting our growth objectives for the year, particularly given the increased investments in innovation, regulation and state political engagements.
Thank you all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

And also, I think one of the things that really pleases us is that the growth we're seeing in both menthol and in non-menthol as well as across all geographies. So we're still seeing that. Of course, we are starting to lap the stronger performance that we had last year. So I think that the deceleration in growth, I think, that you're seeing is really kind of a lapping of stronger performance of prior year as well. I think as far as price gap management pricing, the question there, pricing within the quarter was in line with where we've seen it. We did not add or take away any promotional spending. It was about on kind of average of where we've been. So there hasn't been any changes there on Newport."

We talked about 2% at the beginning of the year. I think, right now, best estimate is between 2% and 2.5%. That's probably a good view. But obviously, we still have 1 quarter to go, and we'll have to see how that plays out. But we also have other regulatory costs, and we'll have to just see how this plays out for the remainder of the quarter. But all in all, we're very pleased with how the year has gone.

The first is about the difference between the underlying volume growth of the industry, which I think you said was down 3.4%, and scanner data, which is significantly less bad than that. And I'd always been under the impression that MSAi data is actually a little bit better to break even Nielsen data. So I was wondering if you can talk about difference and why you think it occurs."

I'll give you, I think, some perspective, and I think this is important to understand as well. If you think about the 3.4%, which is an inventory adjusted -- it's essentially a calculated number with inventory adjustments in third quarter. We go back to second quarter, we had an inventory adjusted number of 1.7% decline. Because of some of the calendar differences between last year and this year, the way I would really think about that is if you look at the 2 quarters combined, they're roughly about 2.5% each. And I think that's probably the best indicator on actually where the industry is. So obviously, you have some different periods with scanner data and so on, but MSAi, I think, is certainly real volume, and certainly, this is just a calculated number. But from a general standpoint, the 2.5% is how we are thinking about it. And certainly, that 2% to 2.5% range that we've talked about for the full year is our expectation."

Hello, everyone. Well, we do have plenty of news today, don't we? But before I speak to the upcoming changes in leadership here, let me touch on a few of the quarter's business highlights.
First, our operating performance continued to be excellent, especially in light of the significant investments in our company's regulatory compliance, innovation pipeline and participation in current state political processes. In addition, both Newport and Natural American Spirit made another impressive showing in the marketplace. And together, with higher pricing in both cigarettes and moist snuff, these premium brands were a key driver behind RAI's strong earnings growth for the third quarter and the first 9 months.
Over the course of the year, we've also accelerated returns to our shareholders. And I'd remind you here of our significant debt reduction, 2 dividend increases and RAI's new share repurchase program. So I'm very pleased with the way this year has progressed. And with Newport's integration now behind us, this is an appropriate time to lay out our leadership succession plans.
As we announced today, I will become Executive Chairman of RAI on the 1st of January, and Debra will succeed me as President and CEO. Yes, I really am retiring as CEO this time, and I've assured my husband there will be no round 3. But I'm fully committed to making a seamless and successful transition with Debra over the next few months. And as board chair, I look forward to play an integral role in RAI's future success.
Not only is this the right time for a transition to new roles, but Debra is absolutely the right person to lead RAI and its companies to the next level. Debra has years of experience and leadership in the consumer products industry, and she has made a significant impact since joining R.J. Reynolds 2 years ago, playing a critical role in Newport's integration into our company's portfolio and helping to drive innovation throughout RAI's businesses. Debra and I have worked closely over the past 2 years, and I am confident that Debra will successfully build upon the strong foundation for our businesses that we have formed together following the Lorillard acquisition.
I also want to welcome Joseph Fragnito from the Kraft Heinz Company to RAI's leadership team. Joe, an experienced brand marketeer and innovator, will take over as R.J. Reynolds' President and Chief Commercial Officer next week. We will be giving you a full update on our plans to continue growing our businesses and advancing our transforming tobacco agenda at our Investment Day event in November.
So for now, I'll hand over to Debra for more details on our third quarter report."

It's great to be here, and I'm excited to be given the opportunity to play a bigger role in RAI's ongoing success. It has been a true pleasure over the past 2 years working with our talented team, gaining a deep understanding of the tobacco industry as well as directly contributing to the success of our strong businesses and powerful brands.
I'd also like to welcome Joe and his expertise and experience to our team. From his work at Kraft Heinz, he knows how to run effective and efficient business units, in addition to his experience in consumer packaged goods. Joe also comes to R.J. Reynolds with a strong track record of bringing brand innovations to market, which will serve the company well moving forward.
In addition to working closely with Susan on the CEO transition, I and the rest of the leadership team look forward to working closely with Joe as we continue to build our company's businesses and execute upon our successful strategies now in place.
Now let's turn to our operating company's results. I'm sure you've all read our earnings report, so I just like to touch on the third quarter highlights and key takeaways. I'll start with combustibles.
We continued to see a positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers in the third quarter. But we are now lapping the impact of those positive tailwinds on industry cigarette volumes, and we are seeing industry volumes returning to a more normal rate of decline.
On an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes declined by about 3.4% for the quarter and about 1.8% for the first 9 months. Given this, our current view for the full year is that cigarette volumes will be down around 2.5%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect cigarette volume declines to track within their historical range of down 2% to 4%.
For RAI's operating companies, total third quarter cigarette volume was down by 1.5% from the prior year quarter and wholesale inventory changes did not have a significant impact on our operating companies in the quarter. Total third quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their combined drive brands adding 0.4 percentage points to 32.2%. And these drive brands currently make up 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, third quarter cigarette shipments fell by 2.5% from the prior year quarter. And after adjusting for wholesale inventory movements, R.J. Reynolds' third quarter shipments declined by about 2.7%. And again, that was versus the industry adjusted decline of about 3.4%. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds in the third quarter was in line compared to the third quarter of last year at 32.3%.
Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, continues to demonstrate outstanding momentum following its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts over the past year. Newport's volume in the third quarter was up about 1% versus the prior year and was not significantly impacted by wholesale inventory changes. We were also very pleased with Newport's continued strength at retail as the brand increased its third quarter retail market share by 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.9%. I would note that we continue to see Newport's market share growth coming across all geographies and from both its core menthol styles as well as its non-menthol styles.
R.J. Reynolds' Camel brand also continues to benefit from an improved national presence resulting from expanded retail contracts, offset by the impact from the removal of Camel styles associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent decision in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, Camel's third quarter retail cigarette market share was down 0.1 share points versus the prior year quarter at 8.3%. However, since the FDA decision last year, we have been very pleased that Camel has steadily grown market share from 8.1% to the 8.3% we saw in the third quarter. And R.J. Reynolds has exciting plans for the Camel Turkish family, aimed at building the brand's equity and growing Camel's market share. We will be providing more detail in that regard at our upcoming Investor Day presentation in New York next month.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an important role in the company's total portfolio strategy. And we are very pleased by its increasing profitability and contribution to the bottom line. In the current environment, with many adult smokers trading up into premium brands, Pall Mall's third quarter retail market share was down 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year but was in line with the second quarter of this year at 7.7%.
At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive premium brand continues to outperform. In the third quarter, the brand increased retail market share to 2.3%, which is an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. And looking forward, we expect continued growth from Natural American Spirit as the brand benefits from increased consumer engagement and growing awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly's Dark Mint, which combines the richer and bolder taste of its dark styles with the popular mint flavor, was successfully expanded nationally late in the third quarter. The differentiated Dark Mint style has been very well received by consumers and should continue to benefit Grizzly going forward.
Grizzly's retail market share of 30.7% in the third quarter was up 0.2 percentage points sequentially and declined by 0.4 percentage points compared to a very strong third quarter of last year. Grizzly also continues to lead the growing pouch category, which now makes up more than 20% of the moist snuff industry, and the brand is the clear leader in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor category. We continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends, its authentic product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Before we move on to Andrew, I'll give you a quick update on RAI Innovations and its subsidiaries, which are working hard on their mission to redefine the vapor category. RJR Vapor, whose VUSE digital vapor cigarettes continue to grow volume and lead the category with market share more than 3x its closest competitor in traditional retail channels, will expand availability of VUSE VIBE next month. VIBE, an exciting new format for the VUSE family of products, is a high-capacity, closed-cartridge tank system with a rechargeable battery. VIBE offers more liquid than the brand's previous products and also has a more powerful and longer-lasting battery. So it meets the desires we heard from adult tobacco consumers to combine the ease of use of a cigalike product with the performance of a tank system.
In the third quarter, RAI Innovations invested significantly in a variety of vapor platforms as well as in the regulatory support behind them. And you'll hear more about the company's innovations pipeline in the coming months.
Niconovum's Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum also continues to perform well. As you know, the brand rolled out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores in the third quarter, and this style is now available in about 19,000 outlets.
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first 9 months of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of drive brands. And we are on plan against those objectives. We also have exciting plans in place to further build upon this success, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
399584,403848876,1056943,"Reynolds American Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debra, and good morning, everyone.

Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.
To start off, I'll cover our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. RAI's third quarter reported EPS increased by 30.4% from the prior year quarter to $0.60. As you know, this comparison includes the impact of the implementation and asset impairment costs last year. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.61, up 10.9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.01 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits.
For the first 9 months, reported EPS was $3.65, up 49% from the prior year period. Adjusted EPS over the first 9 months was $1.69, which was up 12.7%. These 9-month adjusted results also reflect charges of $0.03 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 4.1 percentage points to 48.5%, demonstrating the enhanced strength and profitability of our company's businesses. That brought first 9 months adjusted operating margin to 46.6%, up 4.9 percentage points from last year's first 9 months.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results.
R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the third quarter, with reported operating income up by almost 16% at just over $1.3 billion. The company benefited from solid net price realization of 3.9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Please note that R.J. Reynolds' calculated net pricing for the third quarter does include a negative year-over-year impact resulting from the completed reciprocal manufacturing agreement with ITG Brands. Excluding the impact, R.J. Reynolds' net pricing would have been over 5% for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the company's third quarter operating income increased by 8.7% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $25 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first 9 months, reported operating income was $3.6 billion, and that was up 48.6% from this time last year. 9-month adjusted operating income came in at $3.7 billion, a 37.5% increase from last year.
R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.7 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 50.4%, an all-time high for the company. R.J. Reynolds' strong margin improvement in the quarter was largely driven by the net pricing, the synergy realization related to the Lorillard transaction and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement.
As we touched on previously, wholesale inventory levels impacted industry volume declines in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 8.1 billion units at the end of third quarter this year, representing an increase of more than 1.2 billion units during the quarter. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter last year, which remained stable over the course of that quarter. This dynamic helped moderate the industry volume decline to only 1.6% for the third quarter, a number that would adjust down to 3.4% when factoring in the impact of the inventory changes.
At R.J. Reynolds, the inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of third quarter remained relatively stable versus third quarter of last year as well as over each quarter since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, where another quarter of very strong performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 15.7%. Santa Fe increased its third quarter operating income by 27.7% to $154 million, and that brought operating income for the first 9 months to $410 million, up 21.6% over the first 9 months of the prior year. Strong net price realization of 5% in the third quarter drove the company's operating margin up by 2.7 percentage points to 57.9% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter with volume growth of over 2% and net pricing realization of more than 9%. The company's third quarter operating income of $134 million was up 10.9% from the prior year quarter. And that resulted in an operating income in the first 9 months of $405 million, which was up by 10% from the prior year period. American Snuff's third quarter operating margin decreased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 57.2%.
So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. Now I'll provide a quick update on our long-term debt position.
RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account the repayment of the company's $500 million bond that matured on August 4. This reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt, along with the continued growth in our businesses, has now brought the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA. I would note here that given the relatively low interest rate outlook, along with our improving interest coverage, the company remains comfortable operating at the higher end of this target leverage range.
As we discussed last quarter, RAI's board of directors approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio back to 80% of adjusted net income. And our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share, which was paid on October 3. This quarter's dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since we completed the Lorillard acquisition last June. The company also began to implement its recently announced $2 billion share repurchase program, with repurchases of approximately $75 million of RAI common stock during the quarter. The program is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.
These actions clearly demonstrate the company's commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating company's business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we have reached the 9-month mark for the year, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.27 to $2.33, which is up 14.6% to 17.7% over last year's adjusted EPS.
So all in all, we are pleased with how our businesses have performed in the quarter and over the first 9 months. We're also happy to be meeting our growth objectives for the year, particularly given the increased investments in innovation, regulation and state political engagements.

Of course, we are starting to lap the stronger performance that we had last year. So I think that the deceleration in growth, I think, that you're seeing is really kind of a lapping of stronger performance of prior year as well.

Hello, everyone. Well, we do have plenty of news today, don't we? But before I speak to the upcoming changes in leadership here, let me touch on a few of the quarter's business highlights.
First, our operating performance continued to be excellent, especially in light of the significant investments in our company's regulatory compliance, innovation pipeline and participation in current state political processes. In addition, both Newport and Natural American Spirit made another impressive showing in the marketplace. And together, with higher pricing in both cigarettes and moist snuff, these premium brands were a key driver behind RAI's strong earnings growth for the third quarter and the first 9 months.
Over the course of the year, we've also accelerated returns to our shareholders. And I'd remind you here of our significant debt reduction, 2 dividend increases and RAI's new share repurchase program. So I'm very pleased with the way this year has progressed. And with Newport's integration now behind us, this is an appropriate time to lay out our leadership succession plans.
As we announced today, I will become Executive Chairman of RAI on the 1st of January, and Debra will succeed me as President and CEO. Yes, I really am retiring as CEO this time, and I've assured my husband there will be no round 3. But I'm fully committed to making a seamless and successful transition with Debra over the next few months. And as board chair, I look forward to play an integral role in RAI's future success.
Not only is this the right time for a transition to new roles, but Debra is absolutely the right person to lead RAI and its companies to the next level. Debra has years of experience and leadership in the consumer products industry, and she has made a significant impact since joining R.J. Reynolds 2 years ago, playing a critical role in Newport's integration into our company's portfolio and helping to drive innovation throughout RAI's businesses. Debra and I have worked closely over the past 2 years, and I am confident that Debra will successfully build upon the strong foundation for our businesses that we have formed together following the Lorillard acquisition.
I also want to welcome Joseph Fragnito from the Kraft Heinz Company to RAI's leadership team. Joe, an experienced brand marketeer and innovator, will take over as R.J. Reynolds' President and Chief Commercial Officer next week. We will be giving you a full update on our plans to continue growing our businesses and advancing our transforming tobacco agenda at our Investment Day event in November.
So for now, I'll hand over to Debra for more details on our third quarter report."

It has been a true pleasure over the past 2 years working with our talented team, gaining a deep understanding of the tobacco industry as well as directly contributing to the success of our strong businesses and powerful brands.
I'd also like to welcome Joe and his expertise and experience to our team. From his work at Kraft Heinz, he knows how to run effective and efficient business units, in addition to his experience in consumer packaged goods. Joe also comes to R.J. Reynolds with a strong track record of bringing brand innovations to market, which will serve the company well moving forward.
In addition to working closely with Susan on the CEO transition, I and the rest of the leadership team look forward to working closely with Joe as we continue to build our company's businesses and execute upon our successful strategies now in place.
Now let's turn to our operating company's results. I'm sure you've all read our earnings report, so I just like to touch on the third quarter highlights and key takeaways. I'll start with combustibles.
We continued to see a positive macroeconomic environment for adult tobacco consumers in the third quarter. But we are now lapping the impact of those positive tailwinds on industry cigarette volumes, and we are seeing industry volumes returning to a more normal rate of decline.
On an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes declined by about 3.4% for the quarter and about 1.8% for the first 9 months. Given this, our current view for the full year is that cigarette volumes will be down around 2.5%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect cigarette volume declines to track within their historical range of down 2% to 4%.
For RAI's operating companies, total third quarter cigarette volume was down by 1.5% from the prior year quarter and wholesale inventory changes did not have a significant impact on our operating companies in the quarter. Total third quarter retail cigarette market share for RAI's operating companies increased 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 34.6%, with their combined drive brands adding 0.4 percentage points to 32.2%. And these drive brands currently make up 93% of our operating company's total cigarette market share.
At R.J. Reynolds, third quarter cigarette shipments fell by 2.5% from the prior year quarter. And after adjusting for wholesale inventory movements, R.J. Reynolds' third quarter shipments declined by about 2.7%. And again, that was versus the industry adjusted decline of about 3.4%. Total cigarette market share at R.J. Reynolds in the third quarter was in line compared to the third quarter of last year at 32.3%.
Newport, the nation's #1 menthol brand, continues to demonstrate outstanding momentum following its inclusion in R.J. Reynolds' new retail contracts over the past year. Newport's volume in the third quarter was up about 1% versus the prior year and was not significantly impacted by wholesale inventory changes. We were also very pleased with Newport's continued strength at retail as the brand increased its third quarter retail market share by 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.9%. I would note that we continue to see Newport's market share growth coming across all geographies and from both its core menthol styles as well as its non-menthol styles.
R.J. Reynolds' Camel brand also continues to benefit from an improved national presence resulting from expanded retail contracts, offset by the impact from the removal of Camel styles associated with the FDA's not substantially equivalent decision in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, Camel's third quarter retail cigarette market share was down 0.1 share points versus the prior year quarter at 8.3%. However, since the FDA decision last year, we have been very pleased that Camel has steadily grown market share from 8.1% to the 8.3% we saw in the third quarter. And R.J. Reynolds has exciting plans for the Camel Turkish family, aimed at building the brand's equity and growing Camel's market share. We will be providing more detail in that regard at our upcoming Investor Day presentation in New York next month.
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continues to play an important role in the company's total portfolio strategy. And we are very pleased by its increasing profitability and contribution to the bottom line. In the current environment, with many adult smokers trading up into premium brands, Pall Mall's third quarter retail market share was down 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year but was in line with the second quarter of this year at 7.7%.
At Santa Fe, Natural American Spirit's distinctive premium brand continues to outperform. In the third quarter, the brand increased retail market share to 2.3%, which is an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. And looking forward, we expect continued growth from Natural American Spirit as the brand benefits from increased consumer engagement and growing awareness of the brand's unique values.
At American Snuff, Grizzly's Dark Mint, which combines the richer and bolder taste of its dark styles with the popular mint flavor, was successfully expanded nationally late in the third quarter. The differentiated Dark Mint style has been very well received by consumers and should continue to benefit Grizzly going forward.
Grizzly's retail market share of 30.7% in the third quarter was up 0.2 percentage points sequentially and declined by 0.4 percentage points compared to a very strong third quarter of last year. Grizzly also continues to lead the growing pouch category, which now makes up more than 20% of the moist snuff industry, and the brand is the clear leader in Wintergreen, which is the largest flavor category. We continue to be very confident in Grizzly's strong underlying trends, its authentic product proposition, its highly loyal consumer base and its ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over both the near and long term.
Before we move on to Andrew, I'll give you a quick update on RAI Innovations and its subsidiaries, which are working hard on their mission to redefine the vapor category. RJR Vapor, whose VUSE digital vapor cigarettes continue to grow volume and lead the category with market share more than 3x its closest competitor in traditional retail channels, will expand availability of VUSE VIBE next month. VIBE, an exciting new format for the VUSE family of products, is a high-capacity, closed-cartridge tank system with a rechargeable battery. VIBE offers more liquid than the brand's previous products and also has a more powerful and longer-lasting battery. So it meets the desires we heard from adult tobacco consumers to combine the ease of use of a cigalike product with the performance of a tank system.
In the third quarter, RAI Innovations invested significantly in a variety of vapor platforms as well as in the regulatory support behind them. And you'll hear more about the company's innovations pipeline in the coming months.
Niconovum's Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum also continues to perform well. As you know, the brand rolled out a 10-count mini lozenge in selected stores in the third quarter, and this style is now available in about 19,000 outlets.
So that's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first 9 months of the year. We started the year with a robust plan for growth and a focus on strengthening our premium portfolio of drive brands. And we are on plan against those objectives. We also have exciting plans in place to further build upon this success, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to deliver on our objectives for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Reynolds American had a very successful first 9 months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies, along with the successful completion of our integration process.
To start off, I'll cover our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. RAI's third quarter reported EPS increased by 30.4% from the prior year quarter to $0.60. As you know, this comparison includes the impact of the implementation and asset impairment costs last year. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.61, up 10.9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher net pricing in both cigarettes and smokeless. This adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.01 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits.
For the first 9 months, reported EPS was $3.65, up 49% from the prior year period. Adjusted EPS over the first 9 months was $1.69, which was up 12.7%. These 9-month adjusted results also reflect charges of $0.03 per share related to Engle progeny lawsuits as well as a gain of $2.11 per share related to the sale of Natural American Spirit's international business and charges of $0.12 per share for debt and financing costs and implementation costs.
RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 4.1 percentage points to 48.5%, demonstrating the enhanced strength and profitability of our company's businesses. That brought first 9 months adjusted operating margin to 46.6%, up 4.9 percentage points from last year's first 9 months.
Now let's take a look at our operating company's performance where I'll discuss adjusted results, where applicable. Please refer to schedules 2 and 3 at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results.
R.J. Reynolds continued to perform extremely well in the third quarter, with reported operating income up by almost 16% at just over $1.3 billion. The company benefited from solid net price realization of 3.9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Please note that R.J. Reynolds' calculated net pricing for the third quarter does include a negative year-over-year impact resulting from the completed reciprocal manufacturing agreement with ITG Brands. Excluding the impact, R.J. Reynolds' net pricing would have been over 5% for the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the company's third quarter operating income increased by 8.7% from the prior year quarter to $1.3 billion. This reflects a charge of $25 million for Engle progeny lawsuits and $3 million for implementation costs.
For the first 9 months, reported operating income was $3.6 billion, and that was up 48.6% from this time last year. 9-month adjusted operating income came in at $3.7 billion, a 37.5% increase from last year.
R.J. Reynolds also continued to strengthen its adjusted operating margin, which grew by 3.7 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 50.4%, an all-time high for the company. R.J. Reynolds' strong margin improvement in the quarter was largely driven by the net pricing, the synergy realization related to the Lorillard transaction and the company's continued focus on operating efficiencies and productivity improvement.
As we touched on previously, wholesale inventory levels impacted industry volume declines in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Wholesale inventories for the industry were approximately 8.1 billion units at the end of third quarter this year, representing an increase of more than 1.2 billion units during the quarter. This compares to industry inventories of 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter last year, which remained stable over the course of that quarter. This dynamic helped moderate the industry volume decline to only 1.6% for the third quarter, a number that would adjust down to 3.4% when factoring in the impact of the inventory changes.
At R.J. Reynolds, the inventories of approximately 2.3 billion at the end of third quarter remained relatively stable versus third quarter of last year as well as over each quarter since the completion of the Lorillard acquisition.
Now moving on to Santa Fe, where another quarter of very strong performance was supported by higher pricing and volume growth of 15.7%. Santa Fe increased its third quarter operating income by 27.7% to $154 million, and that brought operating income for the first 9 months to $410 million, up 21.6% over the first 9 months of the prior year. Strong net price realization of 5% in the third quarter drove the company's operating margin up by 2.7 percentage points to 57.9% for the quarter.
American Snuff reported another good quarter with volume growth of over 2% and net pricing realization of more than 9%. The company's third quarter operating income of $134 million was up 10.9% from the prior year quarter. And that resulted in an operating income in the first 9 months of $405 million, which was up by 10% from the prior year period. American Snuff's third quarter operating margin decreased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 57.2%.
So that wraps up the summary of our company's performance. Now I'll provide a quick update on our long-term debt position.
RAI ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash balances, which takes into account the repayment of the company's $500 million bond that matured on August 4. This reduction in RAI's total outstanding debt, along with the continued growth in our businesses, has now brought the company within the top end of its long-term target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x total debt-to-EBITDA. I would note here that given the relatively low interest rate outlook, along with our improving interest coverage, the company remains comfortable operating at the higher end of this target leverage range.
As we discussed last quarter, RAI's board of directors approved an increase in our target dividend payout ratio back to 80% of adjusted net income. And our board also approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 9.5% to $0.46 per share, which was paid on October 3. This quarter's dividend increase follows the 16.7% increase announced in February and is the third dividend increase since we completed the Lorillard acquisition last June. The company also began to implement its recently announced $2 billion share repurchase program, with repurchases of approximately $75 million of RAI common stock during the quarter. The program is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.
These actions clearly demonstrate the company's commitment to returning tangible value to our shareholders as well as the confidence that RAI's management and board have in our operating company's business strategies and performance going forward. And we remain focused on finding opportunities to further enhance shareholder value in a consistent and disciplined manner.
Now that we have reached the 9-month mark for the year, we're narrowing the range of RAI's 2016 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a new range of $2.27 to $2.33, which is up 14.6% to 17.7% over last year's adjusted EPS.
So all in all, we are pleased with how our businesses have performed in the quarter and over the first 9 months. We're also happy to be meeting our growth objectives for the year, particularly given the increased investments in innovation, regulation and state political engagements.

Of course, we are starting to lap the stronger performance that we had last year. So I think that the deceleration in growth, I think, that you're seeing is really kind of a lapping of stronger performance of prior year as well.

So obviously, with volumes, we have seen a significant shift in volumes, I think, throughout the year. It's been relatively consistent with where we've been from a plan standpoint. We talked about 2% at the beginning of the year. I think, right now, best estimate is between 2% and 2.5%. That's probably a good view. But obviously, we still have 1 quarter to go, and we'll have to see how that plays out. But we also have other regulatory costs, and we'll have to just see how this plays out for the remainder of the quarter. But all in all, we're very pleased with how the year has gone. We're very pleased with the 14.7% to 17.7% growth that we've laid out in terms of our guidance range. And we've still got 1 quarter to go, but we feel good about where we are."

Bonnie, I do think your characterization as far as -- what I would say is we see it returning a little more to normal. That being said, it's still a very favorable macroeconomic environment.

That being said, it's still a very favorable macroeconomic environment. It's just we're lapping now. I mean, it's been more than 18 months that we've seen very, very favorable and even improving trends, I would say. And now what I think you have is a little more stagnating trends. But they're still, compared to historical, I mean, to be down on the year. What we're projecting, 2.5%, is still very good relative to that historical norm of down 2% to 4%. We haven't really seen a change, I would say, in premium. And our premium growth, in particular, has been very strong. And so we're still seeing very strong trends on Newport, on Natural American Spirit. So I think within the combustible portfolio, we're still seeing strong trends at the premium end. But we are -- certainly, you are seeing a little more activity in non-big 3. You are seeing a little bit of activity, certainly, in some of the cheaper forms of tobacco again as well. So -- but I think for relevant brands, relevant premium brands, we're still seeing very strong growth there. So we still feel very pleased with the state of the consumer. But I think your characterization of it, it's returning a bit more back to the norms."

And that actually brings me to my second question with some of your comments, more on Pall Mall because it does seem that, that brand has been facing an increased amount of pressure. So maybe you could drill down a little further on that. And I guess I'm getting the sense that, as you mentioned too, that the deep discount category has been picking up. So while premium might be staying quite strong, you're also seeing the bottom end increasing, I think. And is that possibly placing more pressure on Pall Mall? Or are you also facing pressure on Pall Mall from some of the other second-tier brands?"

I will say, for our portfolio currently, we are leaning a bit more toward the -- increasing the profit side of it because we are getting great growth at the premium end. And we -- so we're placing our investment and focuses at that premium end because we feel like that's the place to do it. That being said, we do have -- sequentially, we've had several quarters of being relatively flat. We're just -- it's in comparison to prior years where we are still seeing that pressure. But I think for now, we're very happy and very pleased with where our portfolio is at, and Pall Mall is playing its role."

I think it would be relevant to bring to your attention that the midpoint of our guidance range has not changed since February when we gave guidance and that we are very, very pleased with our 15% to 18% growth, and we are confident that we will deliver that. We are the only company really growing premium market share. And I think it's important to look at this business on an annual basis and not get so worked up over these quarter-to-quarters. We are on our plan. We delivered double-digit last year, and we will do, as we said, 15% to 18% this year. And we are very excited about this portfolio and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. So I thank you all very much. And I've enjoyed working with you, and I'll see you next month.
