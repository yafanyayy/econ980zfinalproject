We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters. This quarter, our growth",254,"Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters. This quarter, our growth was, again, broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. Our strategy is clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating Accenture in the marketplace, enabling us to gain significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. 
We delivered outstanding new bookings of $9.5 billion. We grew revenues 12% in local currency, a very strong performance, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. Operating margin was 13.7%, an expansion of 10 basis points. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis, a 24% increase. We generated free cash flow of $169 million, and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.20 per share, an 8% increase over last year. So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business and how we are positioned for the year. Based on our strong performance, we are raising our outlook for both revenues and earnings per share for the year. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."
972190,327033028,955599,"Accenture plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2016",2016-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our outstanding financial results from the second quarter. Once again our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum",1485,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our outstanding financial results from the second quarter. Once again our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum across almost every dimension of our business reflecting the strength of our leadership position in the market and the relevance of our offerings and capabilities to our clients. 
Before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the important highlights from this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 12% represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is even more impressive when you consider that quarter 2 of last year grew 12% as well. The overriding theme of broad-based growth was evident again this quarter with 4 of our opening groups and all 3 geographic areas posting strong double-digit growth. Our growing leadership position in digital-related services continue to serve us well. And combined with cloud-related services and security, we continue to be the partner of choice in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Operating margin of 13.7% reflects 10 basis points expansion within our annual guided range. Our profitability continues to reflect the absorption of significant investments in our people and in our business as we further strengthen our leadership position in the market. The combination of strong revenue growth, expansion in our margin and tax rate efficiencies resulted in 24% EPS growth for the quarter and 11% EPS growth year-to-date, excluding the gains on sale of Navitaire, which I'll describe in more detail shortly. 
Free cash flow of $169 million came in as expected, and it keeps us on a trajectory to deliver our annual guidance range, which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 5 acquisitions in the quarter, with year-to-date invested capital of approximately $750 million. 
So we're very pleased with our results which continue to demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver on our 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value: Durable revenue growth; sustainable margin expansion; and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details for the quarter. As expected, we delivered a higher level of new bookings this quarter at $9.5 billion, including an all-time record high consulting bookings. Consulting bookings were $5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.2, and consistent with our target. We're particularly pleased with the strong and balanced demand across all of our business dimensions, which is best illustrated by our estimated to book-to-bill. Consulting and strategy had a combined book-to-bill of 1.1; application services, a book-to-bill of 1.2; and operations, a book-to-bill of 1.3. And across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver of our new bookings. 
Finally, we're pleased that we had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which, again, points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive their most important initiatives. 
So turning now to revenue. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.95 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 12% in local currency reflecting a negative 6% foreign exchange impact. Our quarter 2 revenues were higher than our guided range primarily due to consulting demand being even stronger than expected across many of our operating groups and geographic markets. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 12% in USD and 18% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 6% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. We had strong and balanced estimated growth across all business dimensions. Digital-related services continue to be the dominant theme with growth above 25%, which once again fueled double-digit growth in our strategy and consulting services combined. Operations returned to double-digit growth, and we saw an uptick in application services to high single digit growth. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. H&PS grew 15% in the quarter with very strong double-digit growth in both Health & Public Service and overall in North America and the growth markets. Products delivered broad-based growth of 14% and continue to be led by our industrial and life sciences industries, which were very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. Communications, Media & Technology grew 13% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets as well as electronics and high-tech in media and entertainment globally. Financial Services momentum continued 13% growth led by very strong double-digit growth in banking and capital markets as well as strong growth across all 3 geographies. And finally, Resources delivered 4% growth led by a continued strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. We continue to navigate cyclical headwinds in energy and in chemicals and natural resources where growth is significantly challenged. At the same time, looking at Resources overall, we feel that we are more than holding our own in a very difficult environment. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 29.9% in the same period last year. Our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.7% for the same quarter last year, down 20 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.7%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 2 last year. 
In the second quarter, as part of launching an important partnership with Amadeus, we closed our Navitaire transaction, which lowered our quarter 2 tax rate by 1.7%, increased net income by $495 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. 
The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 26% for the second quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '16 benefited from a final determination of prior year tax liabilities as well as changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. 
Net income on an adjusted basis was $905 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $743 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 24% year-over-year increase, of which $0.17 or 16% came from the lower tax rate. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 35 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $169 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $317 million, net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Looking to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 29 was $3 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 373,000 people, which was roughly flat with quarter 1 and up 15% compared to quarter 2 of last year. We now have approximately 273,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Our utilization in quarter 2 was 90% consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 13%, consistent with quarter 1 and down 1% compared to the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million at an average price of $102.14 per share. At February 29, we had approximately 6.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.10 per share, representing an 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2016. 
Finally, before I close, let me mention that our board has approved the decision to terminate our U.S. pension plan, which will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. This is subject to regulatory approvals and is not expected to be finalized for 12 to 18 months. Upon final settlement, we expect to record a principally noncash settlement charge of approximately $350 million. 
So at the halfway point of the fiscal year, we've delivered very strong results and feel that we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

So looking at the first half of the fiscal year '16, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. Year",916,"Thank you, David. So looking at the first half of the fiscal year '16, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. 
Year-to-date, we have delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, which is well above the market growth rate. We continue to accelerate our to the new digital, cloud and security-related services, which, together, accounted for nearly 40% of our total revenues in the first half of the year and grew at a strong double-digit rate. At the same time, we continue to see very strong performance across the rest of our business, which remains extremely competitive and as you know within very good growth. 
Let me bring all of this to life with a few examples beginning with how we are leveraging our innovative capabilities to help clients drive digital transformation. 
Working with Boston Scientific, we have jointly developed the cloud-based digital health solution for hospitals. Built on the Accenture Insight platform, the new solution is designed to leverage our analytics capabilities to significantly improve patient care and reduce frequencies. 
Accenture Interactive continues to gain traction in the marketplace. And has recently been named the digital agency partner for celebrity cruises where we are helping redesign the digital customer experience and [indiscernible] where we are responsible for sales engine optimization and digital marketing analytics. 
In Accenture Mobility, we are using the Accenture Connected Platform to drive digital transformation for [indiscernible], one of the largest transportation systems in the world. We expect to increase operating efficiencies, improve the passenger experience and enable new Internet of Things-based services. 
We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses with strong demand for our core capabilities. And given our industry expertise and end-to-end capabilities, we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. 
In the U.S., Accenture Strategy is helping First Energy improve competitiveness and operational agility with the cash flow improvement program that is expected to deliver more than $450 million in savings over 3 years. 
While working with the leading crude company to transform its global operating model, an integrated team from Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and Accenture Operations, each providing process redesign as well as finance and accounting and HR business process services. 
We continue to invest across our business to further enhance our capabilities and differentiation in the marketplace, including making 9 acquisitions in the first half of the year. In particular, we have made significant investment to strengthen our industry expertise in several key sectors. In health, we acquired Sciences Consultants, a leading provider in implementing electronic health record systems in the U.S. In Financial Services, we acquired Beacon consulting based in Boston to expand our capabilities in asset management. And we acquired Formicary [ph], a leading provider of systems integration and technology consulting for trading platforms in the U.K., U.S. and Canada. Also in Financial Services, we created a specialized [indiscernible] chain technology, which is expected to drive significant efficiency gains for financial institutions. To accelerate those speed to market, we invested in digital asset holdings, a leading developer of Bruksheim [ph] Technologies. And in Resources, we acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting, the international management consulting arm of Schlumberger. And in North America, we acquired word, to expand our consulting, digital and cyber-situated services for industrial asset management. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we have across all 3 of our geographic regions. And I am delighted that we delivered double-digit growth for the quarter in many of our largest markets, including 6, which together comprise 70% of our total revenues. In North America, we delivered 12% revenue growth, driven by another excellent quarter of the strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we delivered exceptional results, with 14% growth in local currency. We delivered double-digit growth in the U.K, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Germany as well as high single digit growth in France. And in those markets, we delivered 10% revenue growth in local currency, led, once again, by strong double-digit growth in the Japan, but also generated double-digit growth in China and in India as well as solid growth in Brazil despite a very challenging environment. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to show a few slides on what it means to run Accenture as a high-performance business. It is imperative that we attract, develop and inspire the very best talents in our industry. And I am proud that for 8 years in a row, Accenture has been named one of the Fortune Best Companies to Work For in the U.S. 
I am equally proud that in India, Accenture was ranked the top company in our sector on business to of the Best Companies to Work For. 
In our business, trust is everything and I couldn't be more pleased that for the ninth year in a row, Accenture was recognized on word of the world's most ethical companies. This is strong recognitions of our commitment to ethical leadership and corporate social responsibilities. 
So as you can see, every day, we are making Accenture an even better business partner for all of our stakeholders. We have very strong momentum in our business, and we continue to deliver value into marketplace. And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the third quarter fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollar will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15. For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our Navitaire transaction in the second quarter, which will lower the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. 
We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For adjusted earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.32 or 8% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also to continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

We did have an even stronger quarter than we had expected, no doubt. As you alluded to, in the mix is the fact that second quarter can be a more difficult quarter to predict, which you know that well, as you know, our business well. And the reasons are that you have the holiday period in there, including the New Year period, which sometimes can be a little unpredictable in terms of how that impacts our available workdays, if you will. And then, of course, you have the turn to the new fiscal year, which can also create sometimes some temporary changes and buying patterns during that first month or 2 of the new calendar year. In our case, neither of those things had an impact on us. And to the contrary, the momentum that we've had now for many quarters continued and even built further. And we saw that the upside relative to what we had expected was, in our consulting and strategy services combined, or our consulting type of work, where we had expected double-digit growth, but it came in even stronger than we had expected. And Tien-tsin, we're very pleased that we were able to support that growth with essentially flat headcount versus quarter 1 which we view as a very positive thing.

What I would say is, I mean, the basic answer to your question is no, in the sense that what we did as consulting is unchanged, and obviously, likewise, the same is true for outsourcing. What we see in consulting is probably a couple of things. One thing we see is that, in fact, I guess, I would say it this way. The foundation of what's driving our consulting revenue growth is the depth of our industry expertise, and the fact that we really operate, not only at the heart of our clients, but at the heart of our industries in terms of being on top of the most important trends and being able to help our clients respond to those trends. And that draws in a lot of our consulting-type services. So if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, if you look at Accenture Digital, that brings us right into the heart of the clients high-priority agenda because it's all grounded fundamentally in industry expertise. The second thing that is driving our consulting growth is the fact that we are establishing ourselves as among the leaders, if not the leader, in the rotation to the new. And when you look at consulting, that reflects -- it includes by the way, systems integration services, which are included in our consulting type of work, and our dimension reporting that reflect in that services. But we have a lot of the systems integration work over recent quarters associated with clients that are investing in and deploying new technology. And so maybe I'll just stop there. But in our consulting growth is really driven by the things that we've been highlighting, which are the priority areas that we're focused on in our growth strategy."

And if you remember back to what I've started say in 3 years ago, what I really focused on is the durability of our business model and generating cash flow in excess of net income.

There is no doubt that in the application maintenance piece of application services, that there is -- that, that is a highly competitive environment, which does impact the revenue yield per labor hour in that marketplace. But yet, it's also important to note, Ashwin, that if you look at pricing, as we define it, which is the margin on the work that we're selling on, our margin in that AO business is -- I'm talking about pricing, is holding up quite well. So we're managing the trajectory and revenue per head, we're managing our cost to serve and alignment are actually better than alignment with that trend. And then we've also mentioned that in the market that we're in now, clients are somewhat universally trying to be more efficient in the cost of ownership of their existing application footprint.

And now all our industries, including banking and capital markets that do benefit from this rotation to the new, again digital-related services, plus cloud-related services, plus security-related services.

And I guess in some of our competitors have lower growth, for me is this is certainly the signal that their business is still too much associated to the kind of current core activities, or let's call them classic activities, which might be under pressure.

We are enjoying good growth in all the application packet, and especially with the new SaaS packages. And I'm very pleased with the growth we are entering with the Salesforce. I am pleased with the growth we have with [indiscernible], with MicroServe Dynamics and some other application package services. So we benefit from having rotating our ERP to the next generation of ERP. And plus, having taken a leadership position in this new application package. So all in all, this business is growing."

We continue to invest in our assets and offerings and our people, et cetera. And so I wouldn't say that we have set a new trajectory. It's just that if you look at the aggregation of our results, you look at where we are year-to-date, you look at our planned investment spending for the second half of the year, which is not materially different from where we started, we just think that the more likely landing zone is in that 10 to 20 basis points. But the point, Lisa, that I would reinforce is that it would be incorrect to interpret that as let's say a shift in the underlying economics of our business. Because underneath that, we're driving much more headroom in our P&L. So our ability to drive profit improvement in our underlying business is alive and well. It's just that this year, the level of investments and the other factors will put us more in that 10 to 20 basis point range."

And just to be more specific, I think I always said it was in October that what the overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least, and it is still sluggish. So we can't expect much regarding the environment. It's unstable, risky, extraordinary complex. That was the case last year, it's still the case this year. When I'm looking at the budget from our clients, I'm not noticing any significant change. Again, it's this story around these 3 drivers now. Digitalization, all industries are investing in digitalizing their operations because all the leaders and all these industries are subject to disruption, and to massive disruption. So that's what the new factor in town, it's not about being better, it's not about getting more productivity, it's about not being disrupted. And not being disrupted is not disappearing in the marketplace. This is the right. So I see this cycle is here for quite a while, and they have to invest. However, it's coming from its rationalization of the operations. I mean, cost, range, IT efficiency, it's all of this. And it's across-the-board in many organization it's coming from IT but as well it's coming from all the business lines, looking at specialization [ph], which, of course, is driving good business for our Accenture Strategy or Accenture Consulting practices to do business for process engineering and process improvement. We had to arise at what we call, I mean, the [indiscernible] and the work that we've been doing nonetheless, which now is representing probably the benchmark of how you transform the customer organization. And if you look at more efficiency, you have, of course, the consolidation. And you see some ways of consolidation, especially in resources, especially in chemical, across the Dow DuPont is the perfect illustration of the kind of consolidation that is happening. I can mention a few as well in the telecom given the need to get to superior level of productivity. So I would say the environment is for us more or less the same around these 3 drivers and in an economic context, which is non-inspiring."

We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters.

We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters. This quarter, our growth was, again, broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. Our strategy is clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating Accenture in the marketplace, enabling us to gain significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. 
We delivered outstanding new bookings of $9.5 billion. We grew revenues 12% in local currency, a very strong performance, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. Operating margin was 13.7%, an expansion of 10 basis points. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis, a 24% increase. We generated free cash flow of $169 million, and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.20 per share, an 8% increase over last year. So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business and how we are positioned for the year. Based on our strong performance, we are raising our business outlook for both revenues and earnings per share for the year. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."

Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial result from the second quarter. Once again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum",1487,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial result from the second quarter. Once again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum across almost every dimension of our business reflecting the strength of our leadership position in the market and the relevance of our offerings and capabilities to our clients. 
Before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the important highlights from this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 12% represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is even more impressive when you consider that quarter 2 of last year grew 12% as well. The overriding theme of broad-based growth was evident again this quarter, with 4 of our opening groups and all 3 geographic areas posting strong double-digit growth. Our growing leadership position in digital-related services continue to serve us well, and combined with cloud-related services and security, we continue to be the partner of choice in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Operating margin of 13.7% reflects 10 basis points expansion within our annual guided range. Our profitability continues to reflect the absorption of significant investments in our people and in our business as we further strengthen our leadership position in the market. The combination of strong revenue growth, expansion in our margin and tax rate efficiencies resulted in 24% EPS growth for the quarter and 11% EPS growth year-to-date, excluding the gains on sale of Navitaire, which I'll describe in more detail shortly. 
Free cash flow of $169 million came in as expected, and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver our annual guidance range, which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 5 acquisitions in the quarter, with year-to-date invested capital of approximately $750 million. 
So we're very pleased with our results which continue to demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver on our 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value: durable revenue growth, sustainable margin expansions and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details for the quarter. As expected, we delivered a higher level of new bookings this quarter at $9.5 billion, including an all-time record high consulting bookings. Consulting bookings were $5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.2, and consistent with our target. We're particularly pleased with the strong and balanced demand across all of our business dimensions, which is best illustrated by our estimated to book-to-bills. Consulting and strategy had a combined book-to-bill of 1.1; application services, a book-to-bill of 1.2; and operations, a book-to-bill of 1.3. And across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver of our new bookings. 
Finally, we're pleased that we had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which again points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive their most important initiatives. 
So turning now to revenue. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.95 billion, a 6% increase in USD, and 12% in local currency reflecting a negative 6% foreign exchange impact. Our quarter 2 revenues were higher than our guided range, primarily due to consulting demand being even stronger than expected across many of our operating groups and geographic markets. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 12% in USD and 18% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 6% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. We had strong and balanced estimated growth across all business dimensions. Digital-related services continue to be the dominant theme with growth above 25%, which once again fueled double-digit growth in our strategy and consulting services combined. Operations returned to double-digit growth, and we saw an uptick in application services to high single digit growth. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. H&PS grew 15% in the quarter with very strong double-digit growth in both Health & Public Service and overall in North America and the growth markets. Products delivered broad-based growth of 14% and continue to be led by our industrial and life sciences industries, which were very -- with very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. Communications, Media & Technology grew 13% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets, as well as electronics and high-tech in media and entertainment globally. Financial Services momentum continued with 13% growth, led by very strong double-digit growth in banking and capital markets as well as strong growth across all 3 geographies. And finally, Resources delivered 4% growth led by continued strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. We continue to navigate cyclical headwinds in energy, and in chemicals and natural resources, where growth is significantly challenged. At the same time, looking at Resources overall, we feel that we are more than holding our own in a very difficult environment. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 29.9% in the same period last year. Our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.7% for the same quarter last year, down 20 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.7%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 2 last year. 
In the second quarter, as part of launching an important partnership with Amadeus, we closed our Navitaire transaction, which lowered our quarter 2 tax rate by 1.7%, increased net income by $495 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. 
The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 26% for the second quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '16 benefited from a final determination of prior year tax liabilities as well as changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. 
Net income on an adjusted basis was $905 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $743 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 24% year-over-year increase, of which $0.17 or 16% came from the lower tax rate. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 35 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $169 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $317 million, net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 29 was $3 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 373,000 people, which was roughly flat with quarter 1, and up 15% compared to quarter 2 of last year. We now have approximately 273,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Our utilization in quarter 2 was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 13%, consistent with quarter 1 and down 1% compared to the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million at an average price of $102.14 per share. At February 29, we had approximately $6.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.10 per share, representing an 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2016. 
Finally before I close, let me mention that our board has approved the decision to terminate our U.S. pension plan, which will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. This is subject to regulatory approvals and is not expected to be finalized for 12 to 18 months. Upon final settlement, we expect to record a principally noncash settlement charge of approximately $350 million. 
So at the halfway point in the fiscal year, we've delivered very strong results and feel that we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Year",927,"Thank you, David. So looking at the first half of the fiscal year '16, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. 
Year-to-date, we have delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, which is well above the market growth rate. We continue to accelerate our rotation to the new digital, cloud and security-related services, which, together, accounted for nearly 40% of our total revenues in the first half of the year and grew at a strong double-digit rate. At the same time, we continue to see very strong performance across the rest of our business, which remains extremely competitive and, as you know, we're getting very good growths. 
Let me bring all of this to life with a few examples, beginning with how we are leveraging our innovative capabilities to help clients drive digital transformation. 
Working with Boston Scientific, we have jointly developed a cloud-based digital health solution for hospitals. Built on the Accenture Insights Platform, the new solution is designed to leverage our analytics capabilities to significantly improve patient care and reduce frequencies. 
Accenture Interactive continues to gain traction in the marketplace, and has recently been named the Digital Agency Partner for Celebrity Cruises, where we are helping redesign the digital customer experience, and for L'Oreal in Brazil, where we are responsible for sales engine optimization and digital marketing analytics. 
In Accenture Mobility, we are using the Accenture Connected Platform to drive digital transformation for Metro de Madrid, one of the largest transportation systems in the world. We expect to increase operating efficiency, improve the passenger experience and enable new Internet of Things-based services. 
We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses, with strong demand for our core capabilities. And given our industry expertise and end-to-end capabilities, we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. 
In the U.S., Accenture Strategy is helping First Energy improve competitiveness and operational agility with a cash flow improvement program that is expected to deliver more than $450 million in savings over 3 years. 
While working with a leading crude company to transform its global operating model, an integrated team from Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and Accenture Operations, each providing process redesign as well as finance and accounting and HR business process services. 
We continue to invest across our business to further enhance our capabilities and differentiation in the marketplace, including making 9 acquisitions in the first half of the year. In particular, we have made significant investment to transcend our industry expertise in several key sectors. In health, we acquired Sagacious Consultants, a leading provider in implementing electronic health record systems in the U.S. In Financial Services, we acquired Beacon Consulting, based in Boston, to expand our capabilities in asset management. And we acquired Formicary, a leading provider of systems integration and technology consulting for trading platforms in the U.K., U.S. and Canada. Also in Financial Services, we created a specialized practice called blockchain technology, which is expected to drive significant efficiency gains for financial institutions. To accelerate those speed to market, we invested in Digital Asset Holdings, a leading developer of blockchain technologies. And in Resources, we acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting, the international oil management consulting arm of Schlumberger. And in North America, we acquired Cimation, to expand our consulting, digital and cyber-situated services for industrial asset management. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all 3 of our geographic regions. And I am delighted that we delivered double-digit growth for the quarter in many of our largest markets, including 6, which together comprise 70% of our total revenues. In North America, we delivered 12% revenue growth, driven by another excellent quarter of strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we delivered exceptional results, with 14% growth in local currency. We delivered double-digit growth in the U.K, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Germany, as well as high single digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we delivered 10% revenue growth in local currency, led, once again, by strong double-digit growth in the Japan, but we also generated double-digit growth in China, and in India, as well as solid growth in Brazil despite a very challenging environment. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to show a few [indiscernible] on what it means to run Accenture as a high-performance business. It is imperative that we attract, develop and inspire the very best talents in our industry. And I am proud that for 8 years in a row, Accenture has been named one of the Fortune Best Company to Work For, in the U.S. 
I am equally proud that in India, Accenture was ranked the top company in our sector on business to deal with, of the Best Companies to Work For. 
In our business, trust is everything, and I couldn't be more pleased that for the ninth year in a row, Accenture was recognized on Ethisphere's List of The World's Most Ethical Companies. This is strong recognition of our commitment to ethical leadership and corporate social responsibilities. 
So as you can see, every day we are making Accenture an even better business partner for all of our stakeholders. We have very strong momentum in our business, and we continue to deliver value into marketplace. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the third quarter fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollar will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. 
For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our Navitaire transaction in the second quarter, which will lower the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. 
We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For adjusted earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.32 or 8% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also to continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up to questions. KC?"

And so if I'll just kind of start it and work through the points that you made is, that we -- we did have an even stronger quarter than we had expected, no doubt. As you alluded to, in the mix is the fact that the second quarter can be a more difficult quarter to predict, which you know that well, as you know our business well. And the reasons are that you have the holiday period in there, including the New Year period, which sometimes can be a little unpredictable in terms of how that impacts our available workdays, if you will. And then, of course, you have the turn to the new fiscal year, which can also create, sometimes, some temporary changes in buying patterns during that first month or 2 of the new calendar year. In our case, neither of those things had an impact on us. And to the contrary, the momentum that we've had now for many quarters continued and even built further. And we saw that the upside relative to what we had expected was, in our consulting and strategy services combined, or our consulting type of work, where we had expected double-digit growth, but it came in even stronger than we had expected. And Tien-tsin, we're very pleased that we were able to support that growth with essentially flat headcount versus quarter 1, which we view as a very positive thing. And so, as it relates to capacity, we certainly have a supply plan that supports the revenue growth that we've projected for the third quarter and the full year. We feel very good about our supply management and our ability to access talent in the marketplace is as good as it's ever been."

And what I would say is that, I mean, the basic answer to your question is no, in the sense that what we viewed as consulting is unchanged, and obviously, likewise, the same is true for outsourcing. What we see in consulting is probably a couple of things. One thing we see is that -- in fact, I guess, I would say it this way. The foundation of what's driving our consulting revenue growth is the depth of our industry expertise, and the fact that we really operate, not only at the heart of our clients, but at the heart of our industries in terms of being on top of the most important trends and being able to help our clients respond to those trends. And that draws in a lot of our consulting-type services. So if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, if you look at Accenture Digital, that brings us right into the heart of the clients high-priority agenda, because it's all grounded fundamentally in industry expertise. The second thing that is driving our consulting growth is the fact that we are establishing ourselves as among the leaders, if not the leader, in the rotation to the new. And when you look at consulting, that reflects -- it includes by the way, systems integration services, which are included in our consulting type of work, and our dimension reporting that reflect in an app services. But we have a lot of the systems integration work over recent quarters associated with clients that are investing in and deploying new technology. And so maybe I'll just stop there. But -- and our consulting growth is really driven by the things that we've been highlighting, which are the priority areas that we're focused on in our growth strategy."

I mean, we are very pleased with progress that we're making on the automation front in both the app services and BPO as well. There is no doubt that in the application maintenance piece of application services, that there is -- that is a highly competitive environment, which does impact the revenue yield per labor hour in that marketplace. But yet, it's also important to note, Ashwin, that if you look at pricing, as we define it, which is the margin on the work that we're selling, our margin in that AO business is -- I'm talking about pricing, is holding up quite well. So we're managing the trajectory and revenue per head. We're managing our cost to serve, and alignment are actually better than alignment with that trend. And then we've also mentioned that in the market that we're in now, clients are somewhat universally trying to be more efficient in the cost of ownership of their existing application footprint. And why? They want to do that so that they can invest more in the new.

Of course, 2 of these industry segments are impacted with the overall natural resources and community pricing downturn. And the other one, I'm thinking about energy and what we're calling CNR, or natural resources, and then you have utilities. And in utilities, it is one of our fastest-growing industry, about 20% growth [indiscernible] body, just to set the scene publicly, because it's explaining. Otherwise, I can see your questions. You're positive with 2 industries, what's explaining that is Resources, we don't ship. We don't gauge at the same time in 2 rotations, if you will, to put it very simply, now rotating to higher growth and higher potential industries. And today, it is from energy to utilities, and then rotating this industry to the new. And if you look at utilities, it is, at the same time, the 20-plus percent growth is significantly fueled by the rotation to the new. And I'm pleased to mention that, because sometimes we believe the rotation to the new is more for the business to consumer kind of industries, the net banking, the insurance to come, the retail, the consumer goods and so forth, but at Accenture, the rotation to the new is big even in the B2B business. And what we've been doing in utility, especially providing superior services in terms of IoT, in term of grid management and bringing digital at the heart of the utilities operation, each creating super normal growth for utility, balancing the downside. And this is taking this opportunity to share with you. That's why we like so much our diverse portfolio of business and diverse portfolio of industry, which is, for us, absolutely critical in our ability to continue delivering sustainable and predictable profitable growth."

You're right that this last 6 months or 6, 7 months, we've seen a third engine kicking in, which I will call consolidation, what you're calling M&A.

And I believe that the main difference between the winners and the losers is coming from the one who are able to rotate to the high-growth areas and to rotate at speed. When you look at ERP, as David just said, all our strategies at in the down cycle was to start building capabilities to rotate our ERP to new ERPs. And at the time, we were calling, as an illustration, building capabilities, strong capabilities with HANA, which is going to be the next generation, an S4, the next-generation of ERP with SAP. I'm taking that as an illustration. And guess what, as we speak, given the investment we made ahead of this HANA S4 wave, today we are already the #1 in implementing S4 and HANA in the world. We see clearly, and you've see probably with the results of SAP, a pickup on this new ERP development. And if you move beyond the strict definition of ERP to the broader definition of application packages, then it's even more spectacular in terms of Accenture positioning. We are enjoying good growth in all the application package, and especially with the new SaaS packages, and I'm very pleased with the growth we are entering with the Salesforce. I'm very pleased with the growth we have with Workday, with MicroServe Dynamics and some other application package services. So we benefit from having rotating our ERP to the next generation of ERP, and plus, having taken a leadership position in this new application package. So all in all, this business is growing."

It's just that if you look at the aggregation of our results, you look at where we are year-to-date, you look at our planned investment spending for the second half of the year, which is not materially different from where we started, we just think that the more likely landing zone is in that 10 to 20 basis points. But the point, Lisa, that I would reinforce is that it would be incorrect to interpret that as, let's say, a shift in the underlying economics of our business. Because underneath that, we're driving much more headroom in our P&L. So our ability to drive profit improvement in our underlying business is alive and well, it's just that this year the level of investments and the other factors will put us more in that 10 to 20 basis point range."

And just to be more specific, I think I always said it was in October that what the overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least, and it is still sluggish. So we can't expect much regarding the environment. It's unstable, risky, extraordinary complex. That was the case last year, it's still the case this year. When I'm looking at the budget from our clients, I'm not noticing any significant change. Again, it's this story around these 3 drivers now. Digitalization, all industries are investing in digitalizing their operations because all the leaders and all these industries are subject to disruption, and to massive disruption. So that's what's the new factor in town. It's not about being better, it's not about getting more productivity, it's about not being disrupted. And not being disrupted is not disappearing in the marketplace. This is the right. So I see this cycle is here for quite a while, and they have to invest. Now where the money is coming from is through rationalization of the operations. I mean, cost, re-engineering, IT efficiency, it's all of this, and it's across the board. In many organizations, it's coming from IT but as well it's coming from all the business lines, looking at rationalization, which, of course, is driving good business for our Accenture Strategy or Accenture Consulting practices to do business for software engineering and profit improvement. We have to raised, what we call, -- I mean, the ZBB and the work we've been doing, one is very public with [indiscernible], which now is representing probably the benchmark of how you transform the cost of the organization. And if you look at more efficiency, you have, of course, the consolidation. And you see some ways of consolidation, especially in resources, especially in chemical, of course the Dow DuPont is the perfect illustration of the kind of consolidation that's happening. I can mention a few as well in the telecom given the need to get to superior level of productivity. So I would say the other environment is for us more or less the same around these 3 drivers and in an economic context, which is noninspiring."

We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters. This quarter, our growth",255,"Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have created in our business over the last 8 quarters. This quarter, our growth was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. Our strategy is clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating Accenture in the marketplace, enabling us to gain significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. 
We delivered outstanding new bookings of $9.5 billion. We grew revenues 12% in local currency, a very strong performance, including double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 operating groups and all 3 geographic regions. Operating margin was 13.7%, an expansion of 10 basis points. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis, a 24% increase. We generated free cash flow of $169 million, and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.20 per share, an 8% increase over last year. So with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business and how we are positioned for the year. Based on our strong performance, we are raising our business outlook for both revenues and earnings per share for the year. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."

Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Once again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong moment",1487,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Once again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum across almost every dimension of our business, reflecting the strength of our leadership position in the market and the relevance of our offerings and capabilities to our clients. 
Before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the important highlights from this quarter. Strong local currency growth of 12% represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is even more impressive when you consider that quarter 2 of last year grew 12% as well. The overriding theme of broad-based growth was evident again this quarter, with 4 of our operating groups and all 3 geographic areas posting strong double-digit growth. Our growing leadership position in digital-related services continue to serve us well, and combined with cloud-related services and security, we continue to be the partner of choice in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Operating margin of 13.7% reflects 10 basis points expansion, within our annual guided range. Our profitability continues to reflect the absorption of significant investments in our people and in our business as we further strengthen our leadership position in the market. The combination of strong revenue growth, expansion in our margin and tax rate efficiencies resulted in 24% EPS growth for the quarter and 11% EPS growth year-to-date, excluding the gains on sale of Navitaire, which I'll describe in more detail shortly. 
Free cash flow of $169 million came in as expected, and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver our annual guidance range, which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest at scale in our business, closing 5 acquisitions in the quarter, with year-to-date invested capital of approximately $750 million. 
So we're very pleased with our results, which continue to demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver on our 3 imperatives for driving shareholder value: durable revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. 
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details for the quarter. As expected, we delivered a higher level of new bookings this quarter at $9.5 billion, including an all-time record high consulting bookings. Consulting bookings were $5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.2, and consistent with our target. We're particularly pleased with the strong and balanced demand across all of our business dimensions, which is best illustrated by our estimated book-to-bills. Consulting and strategy had a combined book-to-bill of 1.1; application services, a book-to-bill of 1.2; and operations, a book-to-bill of 1.3. And across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver of our new bookings. 
Finally, we're pleased that we had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which again points to the strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive their most important initiatives. 
So turning now to revenue. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.95 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 12% in local currency, reflecting a negative 6% foreign exchange impact. Our quarter 2 revenues were higher than our guided range, primarily due to consulting demand being even stronger than expected across many of our operating groups and geographic markets. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 12% in USD and 18% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 6% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. We had strong and balanced estimated growth across all business dimensions. Digital-related services continue to be the dominant theme with growth above 25%, which once again fueled double-digit growth in our strategy and consulting services combined. Operations returned to double-digit growth, and we saw an uptick in application services to high single digit growth. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. H&PS grew 15% in the quarter with very strong double-digit growth in both Health & Public Service and overall in North America and the growth markets. Products delivered broad-based growth of 14% and continue to be led by our industrial and life sciences industries, which were very -- with very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. Communications, Media & Technology grew 13% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in North America and the growth markets, as well as electronics and high-tech in media and entertainment globally. Financial Services momentum continued with 13% growth, led by very strong double-digit growth in banking and capital markets as well as strong growth across all 3 geographies. And finally, Resources delivered 4% growth, led by continued strong double-digit growth in utilities as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. We continue to navigate cyclical headwinds in energy and in chemicals and natural resources, where growth is significantly challenged. At the same time, looking at Resources overall, we feel that we are more than holding our own in a very difficult environment. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 29.9% in the same period last year. Our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.7% for the same quarter last year, down 20 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.7%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 2 last year. 
In the second quarter, as part of launching an important partnership with Amadeus, we closed our Navitaire transaction, which lowered our quarter 2 tax rate by 1.7%, increased net income by $495 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. 
The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 26% for the second quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '16 benefited from a final determination of prior year tax liabilities as well as changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. 
Net income on an adjusted basis was $905 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $743 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 24% year-over-year increase, of which $0.17 or 16% came from the lower tax rate. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 35 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $169 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $317 million, net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at February 29 was $3 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of about 373,000 people, which was roughly flat with quarter 1, and up 15% compared to quarter 2 of last year. We now have approximately 273,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Our utilization in quarter 2 was 90%, consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 13%, consistent with quarter 1 and down 1% compared to the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million at an average price of $102.14 per share. At February 29, we had approximately $6.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.10 per share, representing an 8% increase over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2016. 
Finally, before I close, let me mention that our board has approved the decision to terminate our U.S. pension plan, which will reduce future risk in administrative cost to Accenture. This is subject to regulatory approvals and is not expected to be finalized for 12 to 18 months. Upon final settlement, we expect to record a principally noncash settlement charge of approximately $350 million. 
So at the halfway point in the fiscal year, we've delivered very strong results and feel that we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability in cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

So looking at the first half of the fiscal year '16, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. Year",926,"Thank you, David. So looking at the first half of the fiscal year '16, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. 
Year-to-date, we have delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, which is well above the market growth rate. We continue to accelerate our rotation to the new digital, cloud and security-related services, which, together, accounted for nearly 40% of our total revenues in the first half of the year and grew at a strong double-digit rate. At the same time, we continue to see very strong performance across the rest of our business, which remains extremely competitive and is generating very good growth. 
Let me bring all of this to life with a few examples, beginning with how we are leveraging our innovative capabilities to help clients drive digital transformation. 
Working with Boston Scientific, we have jointly developed a cloud-based digital health solution for hospitals. Built on the Accenture Insights Platform, the new solution is designed to leverage our analytics capabilities to significantly improve patient care and reduce frequencies [ph]. 
Accenture Interactive continues to gain traction in the marketplace, and has recently been named the digital agency partner for Celebrity Cruises, where we are helping redesign the digital customer experience, and for L'Oreal in Brazil, where we are responsible for sales engine optimization and digital marketing analytics. 
In Accenture Mobility, we are using the Accenture Connected Platform to drive digital transformation for Metro de Madrid, one of the largest transportation systems in the world. We expect to increase operating efficiency, improve the passenger experience and enable new Internet of Things-based services. 
We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses, with strong demand for our core capabilities. And given our industry expertise and end-to-end capabilities, we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. 
In the U.S., Accenture Strategy is helping FirstEnergy improve competitiveness and operational agility with a cash flow improvement program that is expected to deliver more than $450 million in savings over 3 years. 
We're working with a leading crude [ph] company to transform its global operating model, an integrated team from Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and Accenture Operations each providing process redesign as well as finance and accounting and HR business process services. 
We continue to invest across our business to further enhance our capabilities and differentiation in the marketplace, including making 9 acquisitions in the first half of the year. In particular, we have made significant investment to transcend [ph] our industry expertise in several key sectors. In health, we acquired Sagacious Consultants, a leading provider in implementing electronic health record systems in the U.S. In Financial Services, we acquired Beacon Consulting, based in Boston, to expand our capabilities in asset management. And we acquired Formicary, a leading provider of systems integration and technology consulting for trading platforms in the U.K., U.S. and Canada. Also in Financial Services, we created a specialized practice called blockchain technology, which is expected to drive significant efficiency gains for financial institutions. To accelerate our speed to market, we invested in Digital Asset Holdings, a leading developer of blockchain technologies. And in Resources, we acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting, the international oil management consulting arm of Schlumberger. And in North America, we acquired Cimation to expand our consulting, digital and cyber security services for industrial asset management. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all 3 of our geographic regions. And I am delighted that we delivered double-digit growth for the quarter in many of our largest markets, including 6 which together comprise 70% of our total revenues. In North America, we delivered 12% revenue growth, driven by another excellent quarter of strong double-digit growth in the United States. In Europe, we delivered exceptional results, with 14% growth in local currency. We delivered double-digit growth in the U.K, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Germany, as well as high single digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we delivered 10% revenue growth in local currency, led once again by strong double-digit growth in Japan, but we also generated double-digit growth in China and in India, as well as solid growth in Brazil despite a very challenging environment. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on what it means to run Accenture as a high-performance business. It is imperative that we attract, develop and inspire the very best talents in our industry. And I am proud that for 8 years in a row, Accenture has been named one of the Fortune Best Company to Work For in the U.S. 
I am equally proud that in India, Accenture was ranked the top company in our sector on Business Today's list of the Best Companies to Work For. 
In our business, trust is everything, and I couldn't be more pleased that for the ninth year in a row, Accenture was recognized on Ethisphere's list of The World's Most Ethical Companies. This is strong recognition of our commitment to ethical leadership and corporate social responsibilities. 
So as you can see, every day we are making Accenture an even better business partner for all of our stakeholders. We have very strong momentum in our business and we continue to deliver value into the marketplace. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the third quarter fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollar will be negative 5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. 
For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6% to 14.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our Navitaire transaction in the second quarter, which will lower the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. 
We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For adjusted earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.32 or 8% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also to continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

And so if I'll just kind of start it and work through the points that you made is, that we -- we did have an even stronger quarter than we had expected, no doubt. As you alluded to, in the mix is the fact that the second quarter can be a more difficult quarter to predict, which you know that well, as you know our business well. And the reasons are that you have the holiday period in there, including the New Year period, which sometimes can be a little unpredictable in terms of how that impacts our available workdays, if you will. And then, of course, you have the turn to the new fiscal year, which can also create, sometimes, some temporary changes in buying patterns during that first month or 2 of the new calendar year. In our case, neither of those things had an impact on us. And to the contrary, the momentum that we've had now for many quarters continued and even built further. And we saw that the upside relative to what we had expected was, in our consulting and strategy services combined, or our consulting-type of work, where we had expected double-digit growth, but it came in even stronger than we had expected. And Tien-tsin, we're very pleased that we were able to support that growth with essentially flat headcount versus quarter 1, which we view as a very positive thing. And so as it relates to capacity, we certainly have a supply plan that supports the revenue growth that we've projected for the third quarter and the full year. We feel very good about our supply management, and our ability to access talent in the marketplace is as good as it's ever been."

And what I would say is that, I mean, the basic answer to your question is no, in the sense that what we viewed as consulting is unchanged, and obviously, likewise, the same is true for outsourcing. What we see in consulting is probably a couple of things. One thing we see is that -- in fact, I guess, I would say it this way. The foundation of what's driving our consulting revenue growth is the depth of our industry expertise and the fact that we really operate not only at the heart of our clients, but at the heart of our industries in terms of being on top of the most important trends and being able to help our clients respond to those trends. And that draws in a lot of our consulting-type services. So if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, if you look at Accenture Digital, that brings us right into the heart of the clients' high-priority agenda because it's all grounded fundamentally in industry expertise. The second thing that is driving our consulting growth is the fact that we are establishing ourselves as among the leaders, if not the leader, in the rotation to the new. And when you look at consulting, that reflects -- it includes by the way, systems integration services, which are included in our consulting type of work and our dimension reporting that are reflected in an app services. But we have a lot of the systems integration work over recent quarters associated with clients that are investing in and deploying new technology. And so maybe I'll just stop there.

Ashwin, what I really focus on is that our cash flow in the range that we've provided, our free cash flow continues to be at a level that is greater than net income. And if you remember back to what I've started saying in 3 years ago, what I've really focused on is the durability of our business model and generating cash flow in excess of net income. And this year continues that trend, and that's the mark of -- that's a very distinctive mark for a very successful cash-flow-generating business, and so we're very pleased with our cash flow. And also remember that the range that we give is $300 million, and so it's a fairly broad range. When you think about the fact we changed revenue, we didn't cash flow, it is a broad range.

What I would tell you maybe -- sorry to state the obvious, but all 3 of those things are in the mix. No doubt about it. I mean, we are very pleased with progress that we're making on the automation front in both the app services and BPO as well. There is no doubt that in the application maintenance piece of application services, that there is -- that is a highly competitive environment, which does impact the revenue yield per labor hour in that marketplace. But yet, it's also important to note, Ashwin, that if you look at pricing, as we define it, which is the margin on the work that we're selling, our margin in that AO business is -- I'm talking about pricing, is holding up quite well. So we're managing the trajectory in revenue per head. We're managing our cost to serve, and alignment are actually better than alignment with that trend. And then we've also mentioned that in the market that we're in now, clients are somewhat universally trying to be more efficient in the cost of ownership of their existing application footprint. And why? They want to do that so that they can invest more in the new. And so we're seeing the benefit of that investment in our systems integration business, which is part of our consulting type of work growth. It's also part of the application services growth, which I mentioned was high single digit. So all 3 of those things are in the mix, and we're navigating them all."

So what I'm explaining and the rationale is the same for health and for banking and capital market. The growth of our business, the growth of our countries and the growth of our industries is directly linked to the speed of the rotation to the new. It is as simple as this. And fact of the matter is that we invested in those digital-related services quite ahead of the curve. Certainly, at the right time, we've been lucky enough to execute the strategy at the right time. And now all our industries, including banking and capital markets, they do benefit from this rotation to the new, again, digital-related services, plus cloud-related services, plus security-related services. And so when I look at banking and capital market, a lot of what we do is around the new. And I guess, if some of our competitors have lower growth, for me, this is certainly the signal that their business is still too much associated to the kind of current core activities, or let's call them classic activities, which might be under pressure, and their rotation to the new is certainly slower than what we are experiencing at Accenture."

On so it's really -- we are executing very well, Lisa, against the investment plan that we really started the year with. And on the inorganic front, we are certainly well positioned to spend probably at the upper end of that range of $900 million to $1 billion, so we would be closer to $1 billion. We continue to invest in our assets and offerings and our people, et cetera. And so I wouldn't say that there is -- that we have set a new trajectory. It's just that if you look at the aggregation of our results, you look at where we are year-to-date, you look at our planned investment spending for the second half of the year, which is not materially different from where we started, we just think that the more likely landing zone is in that 10 to 20 basis points. But the point, Lisa, that I would reinforce is that it would be incorrect to interpret that as, let's say, a shift in the underlying economics of our business. Because underneath that, we're driving much more headroom in our P&L. So our ability to drive profit improvement in our underlying business is alive and well. It's just that this year the level of investments and the other factors will put us more in that 10 to 20 basis point range."

I mean, when I look to -- I mean, to the market, to be honest, I do not see much changes as we speak. And just to be more specific, I think I always said -- it was in October, that the overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least, and it is still sluggish. So we can't expect much regarding the environment. It's unstable, risky, extraordinarily complex. That was the case last year, it's still the case this year. When I'm looking at the budget from our clients, I'm not noticing any significant change. Again, it's this story around these 3 drivers now. Digitalization, all industries are investing in digitalizing their operations because all the leaders and all these industries are subject to disruption, and to massive disruption. So that's what's the new factor in town. It's not about being better, it's not about getting more productivity, it's about not being disrupted. And not being disrupted is not disappearing in the marketplace. This is the way [ph]. So I see this cycle is here for quite a while, and they have to invest. Now where the money is coming from is through rationalization of the operations. I mean, cost, re-engineering, IT efficiency, it's all of this, and it's across the board. In many organizations, it's coming from IT, but as well it's coming from all the business lines, looking at rationalization, which, of course, is driving good business for our Accenture Strategy or Accenture Consulting practices to do business process engineering and profit improvement. We have the rise of what we call, -- I mean, the ZBB and the work we've been doing, one is very public with Mondelez, which now is representing probably the benchmark of how you transform the cost of the organization. And if you look at more efficiency, you have, of course, the consolidation. And you see some ways of consolidation, especially in resources, especially in chemical. Of course, the Dow DuPont is the perfect illustration of the kind of consolidation that's happening. I can mention a few as well in the telecom given the need to get to superior level of productivity. So I would say the environment is for us more or less the same around these 3 drivers and in an economic context which is noninspiring."

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing our strategy very, clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing us to $26.4 billion for the year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year. 
We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.5 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion [ph] in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we have delivered excellent third quarter results, and as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about our business, and I am confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year.

972190,342124455,1001867,"Accenture plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2016",2016-06-23,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard from Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business.

As you heard from Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy, which is built on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry-relevant context and focused on being the market leader in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Looking on our results at a high level, there are a few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local currency growth marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were strong indication of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across our key industries and geographic markets. This is best illustrated by our broad-based growth in the third quarter, which reflected double-digit growth in 8 industries and 8 geographic markets and strong double-digit growth in the new, especially in digital-related services, continue to be a key driver of our results. 
Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results, was consistent with our objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business. Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our 5 businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date, which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis while, at the same time, creating the capacity to make important investments for long-term market leadership. 
Third, as expected, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas, investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter. 
So we're very pleased with our results in quarter 3, which, combined with our first half results, position us very well to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year. With that said, let's get into the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We're very pleased with our overall new bookings, particularly in consulting, which represented the second-highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter 2. 
Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in operations, which had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy and consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above 1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range. And application services had a book-to-bill of 1.0. 
Across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver. Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million, and year-to-date, we've delivered $26.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 9% growth in local currency. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD and 10% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. 
Strategy and consulting services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth, operations again had double-digit growth and application services grew high single digits. And across those 4 businesses, digital-related services were a significant contributor to growth, with estimated growth in the range of 30%. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 16% growth, reflecting strong overall momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad based, with double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter, driven by very strong growth in North America and the growth markets as well as in the health business. We were also pleased with strong growth in public service especially in North America and the growth markets. 
Financial Services also grew 12%, led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets with solid growth across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8%, which was consistent with our expectations. 
From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech as well as media and entertainment continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat, driven by modest declines in Europe and North America, offset by double-digit growth in the growth markets. 
Lastly, Resources grew 1% in the quarter. The 2 divergent trends within Resources continued, with utilities again delivering strong double-digit growth across all 3 geographic regions while energy and chemicals and natural resources remained challenged due to cyclical headwinds. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year. 
General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year. As a reminder, in quarter 3 of last year, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year. 
Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared with EPS of $1.30 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $94 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global headcount of over 375,000 people. Our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter. And attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, up 2% from quarter 2 and consistent with the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 30 -- as of May 31, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 13, 2016, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '16 in the amount of $1.10 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're very pleased with our results, and we're now focused on quarter 4 and closing out a strong year. 
Let me turn it back over to Pierre."

Our very strong results in the third quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to rotate our business to the new: digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for approximately 40% of our total revenues. 
Let me show you an example of how we are leading in the new. We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities, and we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Magazine [ph] as the largest and fastest-growing provider of Digital Marketing services. Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing our unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100. 
In cloud, we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries, such as our life science cloud for R&D. This truly innovative solution to collect, share and analyze clinical data is now being used by 7 top pharma companies, including Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Lilly, to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome. 
In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cybersecurity company based in Israel with strong expertise in cyber defense, and we just opened a new Accenture lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber R&D in threat intelligence, incident response and Internet of Things security. It is all about helping clients become more resilient in today's digital world. 
We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients by [ph] sustainable improvement in their enterprise-wide performance. We are now a leader in this space with a totally new zero-based methodology, which we have delivered with excellent results at many consumer good companies, including Unilever and Mondelez. We are now taking this approach to clients in health care, retail and financial services. We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions. We are taking the majority stake in IMJ, one of the Japan's leading digital agencies; and we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company to expand our capability in machine learning, supply chain and operations analytics. 
We continue to collaborate with leading players in the tech ecosystem to further strengthen our capabilities in cutting-edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence, to launch a new practice focused on its virtual agent platform, which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities. And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our Global Delivery Network. 
We launched a new intelligent automation platform called Accenture myWizard to deliver smarter and more efficient application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all suites of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets. 
In North America, we delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States, bringing us to 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S. 
In Europe, we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I'm particularly pleased that almost all of our largest markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and France. And in Growth Markets, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture cost trends that are particularly important to our future growth. 
The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent pending applications in areas such as: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones, virtual agents, Internet of Things and other platforms. Our intellectual property is an important asset, which drives differentiation and value in the marketplace. 
Second is our brand, and I am proud that Accenture was just ranked #38 on BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, our highest ever on this list. Again, our brand strengthens our unique positioning in the marketplace and drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year '16. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter, which lowered the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.33 or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions."

And if you look at our results over the last 5 years, we've kind of covered the full scope of that range, including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once, if not twice, in that period and I think 1 year being at 30 basis points. So we've covered the expanse of that range, and so coming in at 10 basis points this year isn't inconsistent with kind of our historical performance. Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at 10 basis points of expansion through the first 3 quarters, and so at this point, based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we're trending in that direction. I think the important point to note, and this is different about this year versus other years, where we've been at 10 basis points of expansion, is that we embarked on a journey, especially a few years ago, to really raise our game in the investments that we're making in our business including, but not limited to, the significant capital investments that we've made in acquisitions, which also flow through our P&L, and so when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we're trying to accomplish by positioning our business for the long term by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions us for long-term leadership. And so we're actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion and that it, on one hand, supports we believe double-digit growth in EPS but, on the other hand, underneath it, it represents significant investments that we're making in our business and our people. And the last comment that I'll make is that if you were to look at our underlying margin expansion, excluding the investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done in any previous year. So we feel great about the economic leverage in our model, and we feel great about the focus that we've had on investing."

They want to transform their business and the different industry to what we call rotate to the new in all-digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency, and they want to implement new capabilities. So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to consulting type of services. This is the nature of the demand because of the unique nature of the transformation in the industries. If you look back a few years ago, where outsourcing was going a bit stronger, it was absolutely linked to the fact that they had less need for true industry transformation, any innovative play and the industries were more looking for straightforward efficiency gains. And to some extent, to a great extent, the natural answer we provided at Accenture through straightforward efficiency gain, through -- around the outsourcing, [indiscernible] arbitrage, more productivity, tackling the costs in operation and in IT. So I feel this natural shift from a bit of outsourcing, a bit less of outsourcing to a bit more of consulting, is reflecting the true nature of the transformation in the industries and, by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you will, based on our industry knowledge, based on the investments we made in rotating to the new and based on the fact that we still have significant capabilities at great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients."

Well, what I was referencing was first of all, the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our sequential growth in headcount and recent growth quarters, it certainly moderated over, let's say, the prior 7, 8 quarters and probably beyond. The third thing I was referencing although I didn't say it specifically is that it is true if you look at our headcount growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue, but that rate above our revenue was less than what you've seen in recent quarters. And so there's -- we without giving overly specific, there are 3 things that factor into that. One would be our focus on automation as an example in the mix although as we said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going forward. Things like chargeability are in the mix. Things like attrition levels are in the mix when you consider the hiring number, and of course, the revenue yields that we are getting per billable head is also in the mix, and that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the 5 business, mix of work by geography, and it can also include pricing. So all of those things are kind of in the mix. And in some way, all of those are contributing to what has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our headcount, and that's really all I was pointing out."

We -- if you look at time of our historical norms, we are kind of at the higher level of that range, for sure. And we are running hot, and I think that reflects the activity in the market. We could come down a click or 2 in different quarters and a lot of times, that happens with periods in the year where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads, so for example, in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of our new joiners, campus hires that will start with us in the fourth quarter and early in the fall. So the simple answer is that no doubt, we are running at a very high level of utilization, reflecting the dynamics that we see in the market, but we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable managing, but it could also be a click lower, and we wouldn't be worried about that."

In fact, I would say the demand for talent in the new and talent -- and digital-related talent is one example but also including cloud and security in our business has never been higher, and it is -- as Pierre referenced earlier for Ellyn Shook, I mean, that is job #1 for her is managing the talent, supply side to fuel the new, and I think our pace of activity is not slowing.

That's our goal in life: is to grow more and to grow more than the market. In other words, more than the market we believe at Accenture, and this is at the heart of our strategy that it's going to be about leading in the digital-related services. Now to be clear, we want to make Accenture the leading professional services company in digital-related services. This is what we working on these last few years, and we will continue moving forward. We have evidence that this rotation to the new is happening at big scale. Now -- so the is more significant part of our growth will come from digital-related services this is our strategy first and second, this is where demand is. Now that being said, we want to continue making our core, if you will, extremely competitive in the marketplace. I just mentioned in the call that we invested in our new intelligent delivery platform called Accenture My Wizard, which is bringing a lot of success in Accenture. So of course, we're growing much less in the core than in the new, which is exactly reflecting our strategy. Now, the core is still positive, growing less, but it's still positive, and I believe that on the core, Accenture is growing more than the competition at the end of the day, which has always been our value proposition, is to grow more than the market in the new and much more, and it's grow more than the market in the remaining core, which is what we do, of course, at a much lower level and lower pace but still positive.

We did not comment on the growth rate for the new, but I will say that digital-related services of the 3 components of the new is the fastest-growing. So that helps you as well.

Fact of the matter is growth markets are growing lower than the other 2, maybe just because the other 2 are growing exceptionally well and especially Europe at 12%, which, of course, is a remarkable achievement. Now when you look at the gross market, needless to say, that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when we're talking of growth markets. I mean, first, we're extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe we are providing information many quarters now we've been growing double-digit in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular, and of course, it's a very large market for Accenture, not only for the group still what we're going to call the growth market but for Accenture as a whole. So I'm extraordinarily pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we're making in Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ in order to accelerate the rotation to the new in Japan. I'm very pleased with the new momentum we are creating in China this year together with India and Mexico. Now as you know, in the growth markets, there are 2 factors impacting the growth markets. First is these markets are more vulnerable to the competitive markets at large in terms of synergy and natural resources. We have -- there are significant countries very dependent on natural resources and energy, and of course, they are affected by the commodity price going down. And accordingly, we are affected with this factor. Secondly, the situation in Brazil. We all know what's happening in Brazil. So our growth has been slowing down in a market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, and I love being public on this because I would like to recognize the incredible leadership of leading our practice in Brazil, where we're doing more brand resisting and when I say more brand resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint, we are growing in Brazil, which is probably according to any standards, a remarkable achievement. Now, of course, we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, it's 6% [ph], reflecting very different dynamics, which is what -- it is something I like a lot in Accenture that it is our diverse portfolio of businesses, where, indeed, when you look at the growth markets when Brazil is a bit under pressure or commodity markets, we benefit from growth elsewhere and on balance, 7% is a pretty good from my perspective."

But very happy to do it. I mean, first, let's start with the. We're pleased with where we are with Financial Services overall. If you look at the results we posted these last few quarters, we had a good momentum in Financial Services. Second, it's an industry, which is ongoing some significant rotation to the new for obvious reasons. It's a B2C industry, and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to the new and creating digital capabilities in Financial Services. This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more automated processes, bringing virtual agent to provide financial advisory services. So that's the part which is creating some momentum. However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry that is still under pressure especially in Europe for all sorts of reasons. Negative interest rates never been good especially in that industry for their commercial business. The regulatory consequence are high, as you know, with all especially Europe with all the Basel legislation and all the constraints, which has been put on the banks. So the profitability of the banks been affected these last few years. So, at the same time, they need to rotate to the new but on the other -- but, at the same time, they need to work on their costs. So there is a bit of this story with our Financial Services clients, investing in the new but being extremely cautious about their cost play. That's why after this kind of good momentum we have in Financial Services, we might see some moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit, nothing we are overworried about because we believe the potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure."

Health & Public Service is another strong story. Very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as we look to the fourth quarter. I would say that our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to name, let's say, 3 big drivers, I would pick those 2 operating groups in North America. And then, of course, underneath that S Pierre covered very well, it's just the ongoing continued momentum in digital in the new, which we certainly will continue into the fourth quarter.

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing our strategy very, clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing us to $26.4 billion for the year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year. 
We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.5 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

As you heard from Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy, which is built on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry-relevant context and focused on being the market leader in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Looking on our results at a high level, there are a few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local currency growth marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were strong indication of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across our key industries and geographic markets. This is best illustrated by our broad-based growth in the third quarter, which reflected double-digit growth in 8 industries and 8 geographic markets and strong double-digit growth in the new, especially in digital-related services, continue to be a key driver of our results. 
Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results, was consistent with our objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business. Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our 5 businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date, which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis while, at the same time, creating the capacity to make important investments for long-term market leadership. 
Third, as expected, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas, investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter. 
So we're very pleased with our results in quarter 3, which, combined with our first half results, position us very well to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year. With that said, let's get into the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We're very pleased with our overall new bookings, particularly in consulting, which represented the second-highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter 2. 
Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in operations, which had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy and consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above 1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range. And application services had a book-to-bill of 1.0. 
Across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver. Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million, and year-to-date, we've delivered $26.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 9% growth in local currency. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD and 10% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. 
Strategy and consulting services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth, operations again had double-digit growth and application services grew high single digits. And across those 4 businesses, digital-related services were a significant contributor to growth, with estimated growth in the range of 30%. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 16% growth, reflecting strong overall momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad based, with double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter, driven by very strong growth in North America and the Growth Markets as well as in the health business. We were also pleased with strong growth in public service especially in North America and the Growth Markets. 
Financial Services also grew 12%, led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets with solid growth across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8%, which was consistent with our expectations. 
From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech as well as media and entertainment continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat, driven by modest declines in Europe and North America, offset by double-digit growth in the Growth Markets. 
Lastly, Resources grew 1% in the quarter. The 2 divergent trends within Resources continued, with utilities again delivering strong double-digit growth across all 3 geographic regions while energy and chemicals and natural resources remained challenged due to cyclical headwinds. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year. 
General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year. As a reminder, in quarter 3 of last year, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year. 
Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared with EPS of $1.30 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $94 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global headcount of over 375,000 people. Our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter. And attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, up 2% from quarter 2 and consistent with the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 30 -- as of May 31, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 13, 2016, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '16 in the amount of $1.10 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're very pleased with our results, and we're now focused on quarter 4 and closing out a strong year. 
Let me turn it back over to Pierre."

Our very strong results in the third quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to rotate our business to the new: digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for approximately 40% of our total revenues. 
Let me show you an example of how we are leading in the new. We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities, and we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Advertising Age magazine as the largest and fastest-growing provider of Digital Marketing services. Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing our unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100. 
In cloud, we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries, such as our life science cloud for R&D. This truly innovative solution to collect, share and analyze clinical data is now being used by 7 top pharma companies, including Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Lilly, to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome. 
In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cybersecurity company based in Israel with strong expertise in cyber defense, and we just opened a new Accenture lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber R&D in threat intelligence, incident response and Internet of Things security. It is all about helping clients become more resilient in today's digital world. 
We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients make sustainable improvement in their enterprise-wide performance. We are now a leader in this space with a totally new zero-based methodology, which we have delivered with excellent results at many consumer good companies, including Unilever and Mondelez. We are now taking this approach to clients in health care, retail and financial services. We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions. We are taking the majority stake in IMJ, one of the Japan's leading digital agencies; and we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company to expand our capability in machine learning, supply chain and operations analytics. 
We continue to collaborate with leading players in the tech ecosystem to further strengthen our capabilities in cutting-edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence, to launch a new practice focused on its virtual agent platform, which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities. And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our Global Delivery Network. 
We launched a new intelligent automation platform called Accenture myWizard to deliver smarter and more efficient application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all suites of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets. 
In North America, we delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States, bringing us to 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S. 
In Europe, we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I'm particularly pleased that almost all of our largest markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and France. And in Growth Markets, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture cost trends that are particularly important to our future growth. 
The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent pending applications in areas such as: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones, virtual agents, Internet of Things and other platforms. Our intellectual property is an important asset, which drives differentiation and value in the marketplace. 
Second is our brand, and I am proud that Accenture was just ranked #38 on BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, our highest ever on this list. Again, our brand strengthens our unique positioning in the marketplace and drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year '16. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter, which lowered the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.33 or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions."

And if you look at our results over the last 5 years, we've kind of covered the full scope of that range, including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once, if not twice, in that period and I think 1 year being at 30 basis points. So we've covered the expanse of that range, and so coming in at 10 basis points this year isn't inconsistent with kind of our historical performance. Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at 10 basis points of expansion through the first 3 quarters, and so at this point, based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we're trending in that direction. I think the important point to note, and this is different about this year versus other years, where we've been at 10 basis points of expansion, is that we embarked on a journey, especially a few years ago, to really raise our game in the investments that we're making in our business including, but not limited to, the significant capital investments that we've made in acquisitions, which also flow through our P&L, and so when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we're trying to accomplish by positioning our business for the long term by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions us for long-term leadership. And so we're actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion and that it, on one hand, supports we believe double-digit growth in EPS but, on the other hand, underneath it, it represents significant investments that we're making in our business and our people. And the last comment that I'll make is that if you were to look at our underlying margin expansion, excluding the investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done in any previous year. So we feel great about the economic leverage in our model, and we feel great about the focus that we've had on investing."

They want to transform their business and the different industry to what we call rotate to the new in all-digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency, and they want to implement new capabilities. So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to consulting type of services. This is the nature of the demand because of the unique nature of the transformation in the industries. If you look back a few years ago, where outsourcing was going a bit stronger, it was absolutely linked to the fact that they had less need for true industry transformation, any innovative play and the industries were more looking for straightforward efficiency gains. And to some extent, to a great extent, the natural answer we provided at Accenture through straightforward efficiency gain, through -- around the outsourcing, labor arbitrage, more productivity, tackling the costs in operation and in IT. So I feel this natural shift from a bit of outsourcing, a bit less of outsourcing to a bit more of consulting, is reflecting the true nature of the transformation in the industries and, by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you will, based on our industry knowledge, based on the investments we made in rotating to the new and based on the fact that we still have significant capabilities at great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients."

And in fact, I might say in some ways, we have new and exciting opportunities as we think about this move to a fit-for-purpose focus and how we manage and drive our business, but I'll get more specific on all of that in October."

Well, what I was referencing was, first of all, just the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year, is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our sequential growth in headcount in recent growth",270,"Yes. Well, what I was referencing was, first of all, just the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year, is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our sequential growth in headcount in recent growth quarters, it's certainly moderated over, let's say, the prior 7, 8 quarters and probably beyond. The third thing I was referencing, although I didn't say it specifically, is that it is true if you look at our headcount growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue, but that rate above our revenue was less than what you've seen in recent quarters. And so there's -- without getting overly specific, there are 3 things that factor into that. One would be our focus on automation as an example in the mix, although as we said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going forward. Things like chargeability are in the mix. Things like attrition levels are in the mix when you consider the hiring number and, of course, the revenue yield that we're getting per billable head is also in the mix. And that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the 5 business, mix of work by geography and it can also include pricing. So all of those things are kind of in the mix. And in some way, all of those are contributing to what has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our headcount, and that's really all I was pointing out."

We could come down a click or 2 in different quarters, and a lot of times, that happens with periods in the year where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads. So for example, in the fourth quarter, we have a lot of our new joiners, campus hires that will start with us in the fourth quarter and early in the fall. So the simple answer is that, no doubt, we are running at a very high level of utilization, reflecting the dynamics that we see in the market, but we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable managing, but it could also be a click lower, and we wouldn't be worried about that."

In fact, I would say the demand for talent in the new and talent -- and digital-related talent is one example but also including cloud and security in our business has never been higher. And it is, as Pierre referenced earlier for Ellyn Shook, I mean, that is job #1 for her, is managing the talent supply side to fuel the new.

If you look from a Managing Director standpoint, so all of us, the leadership of Accenture, I just would like to reconfirm that this year, in fiscal year '16, we promoted much more Managing Directors than ever these last 4 years, and I think from a recruiting of leaders, Managing Directors, we've never been so active in the market in recruiting new leaders. So it's important to segregate the leadership we are hiring and promoting at scale because the leaders are driving the business from the total headcount, which we all expect will continue to grow less -- a bit less than our revenues moving forward due to the factor of automation and productivity in our operations."

Now -- so the most significant part of our growth will come from digital-related services because this is our strategy first; and second, this is where the demand is. Now that being said, we want to continue making our core, if you will, extremely competitive in the marketplace. I just mentioned in the call that we invested in our new intelligent delivery platform called Accenture myWizard, which is bringing a lot of success in Accenture. So of course, we're growing much less in the core than in the new, which is exactly reflecting our strategy. Now the core is still positive, growing less, but it's still positive, and I believe that on the core, Accenture is growing more than the competition at the end of the day, which has always been our value proposition, is to grow more than the market in the new and much more, and it's grow more than the market in the remaining core, which is what we do, of course, at a much lower level and lower pace but still positive.

Fact of the matter is, Growth Markets are growing lower than the other 2, maybe just because the other 2 are growing exceptionally well and especially Europe at 12%, which, of course, is a remarkable achievement. Now when you look at the gross market, needless to say, that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when we're talking of Growth Markets. I mean, first, we're extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe we'll provide information, many quarters now we've been growing double digits in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular and, of course, it's a very large market for Accenture, not only for the group, still, what we're going to call in the Growth Market but for Accenture as a whole. So I'm extraordinarily pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we are making in Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ in order to accelerate the rotation to the new in Japan. I'm very pleased with the new momentum we are creating in China this year together with India and Mexico. Now as you know, in the Growth Markets, there are 2 factors impacting the Growth Markets. First is these markets are more vulnerable to the competitive markets at large in terms of energy and natural resources. We have -- there are significant countries very dependent on natural resources and energy and, of course, they are affected by the commodity price going down. And accordingly, we are affected with this factor. Secondly, the situation in Brazil. We all know what's happening in Brazil. So our growth has been slowing down in a market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, and I love being public on this because I would like to recognize the incredible leadership of Roger Ingold and now Leonardo Framil leading our practice in Brazil, where we're doing more than resisting -- and when I say more than resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint, we are growing in Brazil, which is probably, according to any standards, a remarkable achievement. Now of course, we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, this 6% is reflecting very different dynamics, which is what -- if there is something I like a lot in Accenture, it is our diverse portfolio of businesses where, indeed, when you look at the Growth Markets, when Brazil is a bit under pressure or commodity markets, we benefit from growth elsewhere and, on balance, this 7% is pretty good from my perspective."

But very happy to do it. I mean, first, let's start with the beginning. We're pleased with where we are with Financial Services overall. If you look at the results we posted these last few quarters, we had a good momentum in Financial Services. Second, it's an industry which is ongoing some significant rotation to the new for obvious reasons. It's a B2C industry, and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to the new and creating digital capabilities in Financial Services. This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more automated processes, bringing virtual agent to provide financial advisory services. So that's the part which is creating some momentum. However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry which is still under pressure especially in Europe for all sorts of reasons. Negative interest rates, never been good, especially in that industry for their commercial business. The regulatory constraints are high, as you know, with all -- especially in Europe, with all the Basel legislation and all the constraints which has been put on the banks. And so the profitability of the bank's been affected these last few years. So at the same time, they need to rotate to the new but at the other -- but at the same time, they need to work on their costs. So there is a bit of victory with our Financial Services clients, investing in the new but being extremely cautious about their cost play. That's why after this kind of good momentum we have in Financial Services, we might see some moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit, nothing we are over worried about because we believe the potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure."

And so I would say that what is driving us to a strong close to the year, if you will and, hence, raising the revenue 0.5 points on the upper end, you would start with Products and the strong story there. Health & Public Service is another strong story. Very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as we look to the fourth quarter. I would say our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to name, let's say, 3 big drivers, I would pick those 2 operating groups in North America.

And on this wrapper, we are bringing -- reworking on protecting our own IP when appropriate and when possible. This is why at Accenture we make the bridge with the Software providers. The Software providers are all our friends, and we are working with the best possible companies, and they are coming to Accenture, that's why we are a good partner to bring industry expertise, and this is on the industry expertise and wrapper we could build IP."

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing our strategy very well, clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing us to $26.4 billion for the year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year. 
We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.5 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we have delivered excellent third quarter results, and as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about our business, and I am confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year. 
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you."
972190,342124455,1002047,"Accenture plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2016",2016-06-23,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call.

As you heard in Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy, which is built on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry-relevant context and focused on being the market leader in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Looking at our results at a high level, there are a few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local currency growth marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were a strong indication of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across our key industries and geographic markets. This is best illustrated by our broad-based growth in the third quarter, which reflected double-digit growth in 8 industries and 8 geographic markets and strong double-digit growth in the new, especially in digital-related services, continue to be a key driver of our results. 
Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results, was consistent with our objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business. Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our 5 businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date, which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis while, at the same time, creating the capacity to make important investments for long-term market leadership. 
Third, as expected, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas, investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter. 
So we're very pleased with our results in quarter 3, which, combined with our first half results, position us very well to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year. With that said, let's get into the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We're very pleased with our overall new bookings, particularly in consulting, which represented the second-highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter 2. 
Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in operations, which had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy and consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above 1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range. And application services had a book-to-bill of 1.0. 
Across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver. Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million, and year-to-date, we've delivered $26.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 9% growth in local currency. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD and 10% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. 
Strategy and consulting services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth, operations again had double-digit growth and application services grew high single digits. And across those 4 businesses, digital-related services were a significant contributor to growth, with estimated growth in the range of 30%. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 16% growth, reflecting strong overall momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad based, with double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter, driven by very strong growth in North America and the Growth Markets as well as in the health business. We were also pleased with strong growth in public service especially in North America and the Growth Markets. 
Financial Services also grew 12%, led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets with solid growth across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8%, which was consistent with our expectations. 
From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech as well as media and entertainment continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat, driven by modest declines in Europe and North America, offset by double-digit growth in the Growth Markets. 
Lastly, Resources grew 1% in the quarter. The 2 divergent trends within Resources continued, with utilities again delivering strong double-digit growth across all 3 geographic regions while energy and chemicals and natural resources remained challenged due to cyclical headwinds. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year. 
General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year. As a reminder, in quarter 3 of last year, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year. 
Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared with EPS of $1.30 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $94 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global headcount of over 375,000 people. Our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter. And attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, up 2% from quarter 2 and consistent with the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 30 -- as of May 31, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 13, 2016, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '16 in the amount of $1.10 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're very pleased with our results, and we're now focused on quarter 4 and closing out a strong year. 
Let me turn it back over to Pierre."

Our very strong results in the third quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to rotate our business to the new: digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for approximately 40% of our total revenues. 
Let me show a few examples of how we are leading in the new. We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities, and we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Advertising Age magazine as the largest and fastest-growing provider of Digital Marketing services. Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing our unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100. 
In cloud, we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries, such as our life science cloud for R&D. This truly innovative solution to collect, share and analyze clinical data is now being used by 7 top pharma companies, including Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Lilly to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome. 
In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cybersecurity company based in Israel with strong expertise in cyber defense, and we just opened a new Accenture lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber R&D in threat intelligence, incident response and Internet of Things security. This is all about helping clients become more resilient in today's digital world. 
We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients make sustainable improvements in their enterprise-wide performance. We are now a leader in this space with a totally new zero-based methodology, which we have delivered with excellent results at many consumer good companies, including Unilever and Mondelez. We are now taking this approach to clients in health care, retail and financial services. We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions. We are taking a majority stake in IMJ, one of Japan's leading digital agencies; and we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company to expand our capability in machine learning, supply chain and operations analytics. 
We continue to collaborate with leading players in the tech ecosystem to further strengthen our capabilities in cutting-edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence, to launch a new practice focused on its virtual agent platform, which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities. And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our Global Delivery Network. 
We launched a new intelligent automation platform called Accenture myWizard to deliver smarter and more efficient application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all suites [ph] of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets. 
In North America, we delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States, bringing us to 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S. 
In Europe, we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I'm particularly pleased that almost all of our largest markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and France. And in Growth Markets, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture cost trends that are particularly important to our future growth. 
The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent pending applications in areas such as: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones, virtual agents, Internet of Things and other platforms. Our intellectual property is an important asset, which drives differentiation and value in the marketplace. 
Second is our brand, and I am proud that Accenture was just ranked #38 on BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, our highest ever on this list. Again, our brand strengthens our unique positioning in the marketplace and drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year '16. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter, which lowered the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.33 or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions."

And if you look at our results over the last 5 years, we've kind of covered the full scope of that range, including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once, if not twice, in that period and I think 1 year being at 30 basis points. So we've covered the expanse of that range, and so coming in at 10 basis points this year isn't inconsistent with kind of our historical performance. Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at 10 basis points of expansion through the first 3 quarters, and so at this point, based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we're trending in that direction. I think the important point to note, and this is different about this year versus other years, where we've been at 10 basis points of expansion, is that we embarked on a journey, especially a few years ago, to really raise our game in the investments that we're making in our business including, but not limited to, the significant capital investments that we've made in acquisitions, which also flow through our P&L, and so when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we're trying to accomplish by positioning our business for the long term by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions us for long-term leadership. And so we're actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion in that it, on one hand, supports, we believe, double-digit growth in EPS but, on the other hand, underneath it, it represents significant investments that we're making in our business and our people. And the last comment that I'll make is that if you were to look at our underlying margin expansion, excluding the investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done in any previous year. So we feel great about the economic leverage in our model, and we feel great about the focus that we've had on investing."

They want to transform their business in the different industries to what we call rotate to the new in all the digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency, and they want to implement new capabilities. So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to consulting type of services. This is the nature of the demand because of the unique nature of the transformation in the industries. If you look back a few years ago, where outsourcing was growing a bit stronger, it was absolutely linked to the fact that you have less need for true industry transformation and innovative play and the industries were more looking for straightforward efficiency gains. And to some extent, to a great extent, the natural answer we provided at Accenture through straightforward efficiency gains, through -- around the outsourcing, labor arbitrage, more productivity, tackling the costs in operations and in IT. So I feel this natural shift from a bit of outsourcing, a bit less of outsourcing to a bit more of consulting, is reflecting the true nature of the transformation in the industries and, by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you will, based on our industry knowledge, based on the investments we made in rotating to the new and based on the fact that we still have significant capabilities at great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients."

Well, what I was referencing was, first of all, just the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year, is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our sequential growth in headcount in recent growth -- quarters, it's certainly moderated over, let's say, the prior 7, 8 quarters and probably beyond. The third thing I was referencing, although I didn't say it specifically, is that it is true if you look at our headcount growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue, but that rate above our revenue was less than what you've seen in recent quarters. And so there's -- without getting overly specific, there are 3 things that factor into that. One would be our focus on automation as an example in the mix, although as we've said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going forward. Things like chargeability are in the mix. Things like attrition levels are in the mix when you consider the hiring number and, of course, the revenue yield that we're getting per billable head is also in the mix. And that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the 5 businesses, mix of work by geography and it can also include pricing. So all of those things are kind of in the mix. And in some way, all of those are contributing to what has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our headcount, and that's really all I was pointing out."

We -- if you look at kind of our historical norm, we are kind of at the higher level of that range, for sure. And we are running hot, and I think that reflects the activity in the market. We could come down a click or 2 in different quarters, and a lot of times, that happens with periods in the year where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads. So for example, in the fourth quarter, we have a lot of our new joiners, campus hires that will start with us in the fourth quarter and early in the fall. So the simple answer is that, no doubt, we are running at a very high level of utilization, reflecting the dynamics that we see in the market, but we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable managing, but it could also be a click lower, and we wouldn't be worried about that."

In fact, I would say the demand for talent in the new and talent -- and digital-related talent is one example but also including cloud and security in our business has never been higher.

If you look from a Managing Director standpoint, so all of us, the leadership of Accenture, I just would like to reconfirm that this year, in fiscal year '16, we promoted much more Managing Directors than ever these last 4 years, and I think from a recruiting of leaders, Managing Directors, we've never been so active in the market in recruiting new leaders.

Now",449,"Yes, I mean, happy to comment, I guess. Fact of the matter is Growth Markets are growing lower than the other 2, maybe just because the other 2 are growing exceptionally well and especially Europe at 12%, which, of course, is a remarkable achievement. Now when you look at the Growth Markets, needless to say, that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when we're talking of our Growth Markets. I mean, first, we're extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe we'll provide information, how many quarters now we've been growing double digits in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular and, of course, it's a very large market for Accenture, not only for the group, still, what we're going to calling the Growth Markets but for Accenture as a whole. So I'm extraordinarily pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we are making in Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ in order to accelerate the rotation to the new in Japan. I'm very pleased with the new momentum we are creating in China this year together with India and Mexico. Now as you know, in the Growth Markets, there are 2 factors impacting the Growth Markets. First is these markets are more vulnerable to the competitive markets at large in terms of energy and natural resources. We have -- there are significant countries very dependent on natural resources and energy and, of course, they are affected by the commodity price going down. And accordingly, we are affected with this factor. Secondly, the situation in Brazil. We all know what's happening in Brazil. So our growth has been slowing down in a market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, and I love being public on this because I would like to recognize the incredible leadership of Roger Ingold and now Leonardo Framil leading our practice in Brazil, where we're doing more than resisting -- and when I say more than resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint, we are growing in Brazil, which is probably, according to any standards, a remarkable achievement. Now of course, we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, this 6% is reflecting very different dynamics, which is what -- if there is something I like a lot in Accenture, it is our diverse portfolio of businesses where, indeed, when you look at the Growth Markets, when Brazil is a bit under pressure or commodity markets, we benefit from growth elsewhere and, on balance, this 7% is pretty good from my perspective."

But very happy to do it. I mean, first, let's start with the beginning. We're pleased with where we are with Financial Services overall. If you look at the results we posted these last few quarters, we had a good momentum in Financial Services. Second, it's an industry which is ongoing some significant rotation to the new for obvious reasons. It's a B2C industry, and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to the new and creating digital capabilities in Financial Services. This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more automated processes, bringing virtual agents to provide financial advisory services. So that's the part which is creating some momentum. However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry which is still under pressure especially in Europe for all sorts of reasons. Negative interest rates, never been good, especially in that industry for their commercial business. The regulatory constraints are high, as you know, with all -- especially in Europe, with all the Basel legislation and all the constraints which has been put on the banks. And so the profitability of the bank's been affected these last few years. So at the same time, they need to rotate to the new but at the other -- but at the same time, they need to work on their costs. So there is a bit of history with our Financial Services clients, investing in the new but being extremely cautious about their cost play. That's why after this kind of good momentum we have in Financial Services, we might see some moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit, nothing we are over worried about because we believe the potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure."

And if you look at the guidance range of the 6% to 9% and if you just -- we just simply did the math, if you do the mathematical extension of that, you get to the 9.5% to 10.5% range. I think in terms of what's driving that of late, Products is very, very hot right now, and the thing that is impressive about Products, which also happens to be our largest operating group, is that their growth is broad based across every industry in that operating group as well as each of the 3 geographic areas. And so I would say that what is driving us to a strong close to the year, if you will and, hence, raising the revenue 0.5 point on the upper end, you would start with Products and the strong story there. Health & Public Service is another strong story. Very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as we look to the fourth quarter. I would say our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to name, let's say, 3 big drivers, I would pick those 2 operating groups in North America. And then, of course, underneath that, as Pierre covered very well, is just the ongoing continued momentum in digital and the new, which we certainly will continue into the fourth quarter. So those are some of the big themes in terms of driving what we hope will be a good, strong close to the year."

We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing our strategy very well, clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing us to $26.4 billion for the year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year. 
We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.5 billion, and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

As you heard in Pierre's comments, our third quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy, which is built on 5 businesses, delivered in an industry-relevant context and focused on being the market leader in helping our clients rotate to the new. 
Looking at our results at a high level, there are a few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local currency growth marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were a strong indication of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across our key industries and geographic markets. This is best illustrated by our broad-based growth in the third quarter, which reflected double-digit growth in 8 industries and 8 geographic markets and strong double-digit growth in the new, especially in digital-related services, continue to be a key driver of our results. 
Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results, was consistent with our objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business. Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our 5 businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date, which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis while, at the same time, creating the capacity to make important investments for long-term market leadership. 
Third, as expected, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas, investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter. 
So we're very pleased with our results in quarter 3, which, combined with our first half results, position us very well to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year. With that said, let's get into the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We're very pleased with our overall new bookings, particularly in consulting, which represented the second-highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter 2. 
Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in operations, which had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy and consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above 1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range. And application services had a book-to-bill of 1.0. 
Across the board, digital-related services continue to be a significant driver. Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million, and year-to-date, we've delivered $26.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 9% growth in local currency. 
Turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD and 10% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency, and our outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. 
Strategy and consulting services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth, operations again had double-digit growth and application services grew high single digits. And across those 4 businesses, digital-related services were a significant contributor to growth, with estimated growth in the range of 30%. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 16% growth, reflecting strong overall momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad based, with double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter, driven by very strong growth in North America and the Growth Markets as well as in the health business. We were also pleased with strong growth in public service especially in North America and the Growth Markets. 
Financial Services also grew 12%, led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets with solid growth across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8%, which was consistent with our expectations. 
From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech as well as media and entertainment continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat, driven by modest declines in Europe and North America, offset by double-digit growth in the Growth Markets. 
Lastly, Resources grew 1% in the quarter. The 2 divergent trends within Resources continued, with utilities again delivering strong double-digit growth across all 3 geographic regions while energy and chemicals and natural resources remained challenged due to cyclical headwinds. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year. 
General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year. As a reminder, in quarter 3 of last year, we recorded a noncash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter 3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year. 
Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared with EPS of $1.30 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. 
Turning to DSOs. Our days services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $94 million. 
Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global headcount of over 375,000 people. Our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter. And attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15%, up 2% from quarter 2 and consistent with the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 30 -- as of May 31, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 13, 2016, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal '16 in the amount of $1.10 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. 
So with 3 quarters in the books, we're very pleased with our results, and we're now focused on quarter 4 and closing out a strong year. 
Let me turn it back over to Pierre."

Our very strong results in the third quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to rotate our business to the new: digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for approximately 40% of our total revenues. 
Let me show a few examples of how we are leading in the new. We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities, and we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Advertising Age magazine as the largest and fastest-growing provider of Digital Marketing services. Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing our unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100. 
In cloud, we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries, such as our life science cloud for R&D. This truly innovative solution to collect, share and analyze clinical data is now being used by 7 top pharma companies, including Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Lilly to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome. 
In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cybersecurity company based in Israel with strong expertise in cyber defense, and we just opened a new Accenture lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber R&D in threat intelligence, incident response and Internet of Things security. This is all about helping clients become more resilient in today's digital world. 
We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients make sustainable improvements in their enterprise-wide performance. We are now a leader in this space with a totally new zero-based methodology, which we have delivered with excellent results at many consumer good companies, including Unilever and Mondelez. We are now taking this approach to clients in health care, retail and financial services. We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions. We are taking a majority stake in IMJ, one of Japan's leading digital agencies; and we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company to expand our capability in machine learning, supply chain and operations analytics. 
We continue to collaborate with leading players in the tech ecosystem to further strengthen our capabilities in cutting-edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence, to launch a new practice focused on its virtual agent platform, which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities. And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our Global Delivery Network. 
We launched a new intelligent automation platform called Accenture myWizard to deliver smarter and more efficient application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are driving across all suites [ph] of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets. 
In North America, we delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States, bringing us to 8 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S. 
In Europe, we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I'm particularly pleased that almost all of our largest markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and France. And in Growth Markets, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture cost trends that are particularly important to our future growth. 
The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent pending applications in areas such as: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones, virtual agents, Internet of Things and other platforms. Our intellectual property is an important asset, which drives differentiation and value in the marketplace. 
Second is our brand, and I am proud that Accenture was just ranked #38 on BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, our highest ever on this list. Again, our brand strengthens our unique positioning in the marketplace and drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent. 
So with the first 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year '16. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '16, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '15. 
For the full fiscal '16, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '15. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '16 to be 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter, which lowered the full year FY '16 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal '16 excludes the impact of this transaction. We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $5.29 to $5.33 or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal '15 results. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '16, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions."

And if you look at our results over the last 5 years, we've kind of covered the full scope of that range, including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once, if not twice, in that period and I think 1 year being at 30 basis points. So we've covered the expanse of that range, and so coming in at 10 basis points this year isn't inconsistent with kind of our historical performance. Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at 10 basis points of expansion through the first 3 quarters, and so at this point, based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we're trending in that direction. I think the important point to note, and this is different about this year versus other years, where we've been at 10 basis points of expansion, is that we embarked on a journey, especially a few years ago, to really raise our game in the investments that we're making in our business including, but not limited to, the significant capital investments that we've made in acquisitions, which also flow through our P&L, and so when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we're trying to accomplish by positioning our business for the long term by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions us for long-term leadership. And so we're actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion in that it, on one hand, supports, we believe, double-digit growth in EPS but, on the other hand, underneath it, it represents significant investments that we're making in our business and our people. And the last comment that I'll make is that if you were to look at our underlying margin expansion, excluding the investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done in any previous year. So we feel great about the economic leverage in our model, and we feel great about the focus that we've had on investing."

They want to transform their business in the different industries to what we call rotate to the new in all the digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency, and they want to implement new capabilities. So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to consulting type of services. This is the nature of the demand because of the unique nature of the transformation in the industries. If you look back a few years ago, where outsourcing was growing a bit stronger, it was absolutely linked to the fact that you have less need for true industry transformation and innovative play and the industries were more looking for straightforward efficiency gains. And to some extent, to a great extent, the natural answer we provided at Accenture through straightforward efficiency gains, through -- around the outsourcing, labor arbitrage, more productivity, tackling the costs in operations and in IT. So I feel this natural shift from a bit of outsourcing, a bit less of outsourcing to a bit more of consulting, is reflecting the true nature of the transformation in the industries and, by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you will, based on our industry knowledge, based on the investments we made in rotating to the new and based on the fact that we still have significant capabilities at great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients."

Well, what I was referencing was, first of all, just the fact that we will hire fewer people this year than we did last year, is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our sequential growth in headcount in recent growth -- quarters, it's certainly moderated over, let's say, the prior 7, 8 quarters and probably beyond. The third thing I was referencing, although I didn't say it specifically, is that it is true if you look at our headcount growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue, but that rate above our revenue was less than what you've seen in recent quarters. And so there's -- without getting overly specific, there are 3 things that factor into that. One would be our focus on automation as an example in the mix, although as we've said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going forward. Things like chargeability are in the mix. Things like attrition levels are in the mix when you consider the hiring number and, of course, the revenue yield that we're getting per billable head is also in the mix. And that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the 5 businesses, mix of work by geography and it can also include pricing. So all of those things are kind of in the mix. And in some way, all of those are contributing to what has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our headcount, and that's really all I was pointing out."

I mean, there are things that could work in our favor going forward that could influence that metric further. We -- if you look at kind of our historical norm, we are kind of at the higher level of that range, for sure. And we are running hot, and I think that reflects the activity in the market. We could come down a click or 2 in different quarters, and a lot of times, that happens with periods in the year where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads. So for example, in the fourth quarter, we have a lot of our new joiners, campus hires that will start with us in the fourth quarter and early in the fall. So the simple answer is that, no doubt, we are running at a very high level of utilization, reflecting the dynamics that we see in the market, but we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable managing, but it could also be a click lower, and we wouldn't be worried about that."

But let me just make the point that as the business is rotating overall, we are also rotating a lot of talent within our headcount, and so what is not apparent by simply looking at the overall numbers is the talent rotation that has taken place, and I can assure you that our pace of investing and acquiring headcount specifically focused on driving this new agenda and the digital-related services agenda, as part of that, has not slowed down at all. In fact, I would say the demand for talent in the new and talent -- and digital-related talent is one example but also including cloud and security in our business has never been higher. And it is, as Pierre referenced earlier for Ellyn Shook, I mean, that is job #1 for her, is managing the talent supply side to fuel the new.

If you look from a Managing Director standpoint, so all of us, the leadership of Accenture, I just would like to reconfirm that this year, in fiscal year '16, we promoted much more Managing Directors than ever these last 4 years, and I think from a recruiting of leaders, Managing Directors, we've never been so active in the market in recruiting new leaders. So it's important to segregate the leadership we are hiring and promoting at scale because the leaders are driving the business from the total headcount, which we all expect will continue to grow less -- a bit less than our revenues moving forward due to the factor of automation and productivity in our operations."

Now to be clear, we want to make Accenture the leading professional services company in digital-related services. This is what we -- working on these last few years and we will continue moving forward. We have evidence that this rotation to the new is happening at big scale. Now -- so the most significant part of our growth will come from digital-related services because this is our strategy first; and second, this is where the demand is. Now that being said, we want to continue making our core, if you will, extremely competitive in the marketplace. I just mentioned in the call that we invested in our new intelligent delivery platform called Accenture myWizard, which is bringing a lot of success in Accenture. So of course, we're growing much less in the core than in the new, which is exactly reflecting our strategy. Now the core is still positive, growing less, but it's still positive, and I believe that on the core, Accenture is growing more than the competition at the end of the day, which has always been our value proposition, is to grow more than the market in the new and much more, and it's to grow more than the market in the remaining core, which is what we do, of course, at a much lower level and lower pace but still positive.

We did not comment on the growth rate for the new, but I will say that digital-related services of the 3 components of the new is the fastest growing. So that helps you as well.

Fact of the matter is Growth Markets are growing lower than the other 2, maybe just because the other 2 are growing exceptionally well and especially Europe at 12%, which, of course, is a remarkable achievement. Now when you look at the Growth Markets, needless to say, that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when we're talking of our Growth Markets. I mean, first, we're extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe we'll provide information, how many quarters now we've been growing double digits in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular and, of course, it's a very large market for Accenture, not only for the group, still, what we're going to calling the Growth Markets but for Accenture as a whole. So I'm extraordinarily pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we are making in Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ in order to accelerate the rotation to the new in Japan. I'm very pleased with the new momentum we are creating in China this year together with India and Mexico. Now as you know, in the Growth Markets, there are 2 factors impacting the Growth Markets. First is these markets are more vulnerable to the competitive markets at large in terms of energy and natural resources. We have -- there are significant countries very dependent on natural resources and energy and, of course, they are affected by the commodity price going down. And accordingly, we are affected with this factor. Secondly, the situation in Brazil. We all know what's happening in Brazil. So our growth has been slowing down in a market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, and I love being public on this because I would like to recognize the incredible leadership of Roger Ingold and now Leonardo Framil leading our practice in Brazil, where we're doing more than resisting -- and when I say more than resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint, we are growing in Brazil, which is probably, according to any standards, a remarkable achievement. Now of course, we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, this 6% is reflecting very different dynamics, which is what -- if there is something I like a lot in Accenture, it is our diverse portfolio of businesses where, indeed, when you look at the Growth Markets, when Brazil is a bit under pressure or commodity markets, we benefit from growth elsewhere and, on balance, this 7% is pretty good from my perspective."

But very happy to do it. I mean, first, let's start with the beginning. We're pleased with where we are with Financial Services overall. If you look at the results we posted these last few quarters, we had a good momentum in Financial Services. Second, it's an industry which is ongoing some significant rotation to the new for obvious reasons. It's a B2C industry, and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to the new and creating digital capabilities in Financial Services. This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more automated processes, bringing virtual agents to provide financial advisory services. So that's the part which is creating some momentum. However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry which is still under pressure especially in Europe for all sorts of reasons. Negative interest rates, never been good, especially in that industry for their commercial business. The regulatory constraints are high, as you know, with all -- especially in Europe, with all the Basel legislation and all the constraints which has been put on the banks. And so the profitability of the bank's been affected these last few years. So at the same time, they need to rotate to the new but at the other -- but at the same time, they need to work on their costs. So there is a bit of history with our Financial Services clients, investing in the new but being extremely cautious about their cost play. That's why after this kind of good momentum we have in Financial Services, we might see some moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit, nothing we are over worried about because we believe the potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure."

I think in terms of what's driving that of late, Products is very, very hot right now, and the thing that is impressive about Products, which also happens to be our largest operating group, is that their growth is broad based across every industry in that operating group as well as each of the 3 geographic areas. And so I would say that what is driving us to a strong close to the year, if you will and, hence, raising the revenue 0.5 point on the upper end, you would start with Products and the strong story there. Health & Public Service is another strong story. Very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as we look to the fourth quarter. I would say our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to name, let's say, 3 big drivers, I would pick those 2 operating groups in North America. And then, of course, underneath that, as Pierre covered very well, is just the ongoing continued momentum in digital and the new, which we certainly will continue into the fourth quarter.

Given some limitations, I'm not able to be [indiscernible], so David and I decided to pre-record our remarks and then we will be available to take your questions at the end of the call. 
Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I'm particularly pleased with our [indiscernible] report and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth for 2 years in a row, and we have gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights for the year.
We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We've generated record revenues of $32.9 billion, with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted basis, an [indiscernible]% increase. Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 10 basis point on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1[ph] billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And [indiscernible] a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend. 
So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our business, which clearly reflect the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day. 
Now let me hand over to David."

We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it related to being the leader",1544,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it related to being the leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to the new, including digital, cloud and security. By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal '16 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal '15. 
At a high level, our quarter 4 results continued to reflect strong performance across all 3 of our financial imperatives: durable revenue growth faster than the market, sustainable margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people, and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. To be more specific, quarter 4 represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth, with continued significant gains and market share. Our net revenue growth of just over 9% local currency was broad-based and balanced across most dimensions of our business. Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from quarter 4 of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability, which enabled us to invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter. And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business, while returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
So we finished the year in a manner which was very consistent with the previous 3 quarters, with strong broad base growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. 
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. And outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital-related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency. 
Turning now to revenues. 
Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. 
The trends in revenue growth across our 5 businesses were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations, posted another quarter of double-digit growth, while application services delivered very solid growth in the mid-single-digit range. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in the new led by digital related services. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in products reflects the rapid adoption of the new across all of the industries within products. And our investments over the past few years are serving us very well in meeting the new demands of our clients. posted another strong quarter with 11% growth, driven by a continued double-digit growth in health, and overall in, North America and the growth markets. 
Financial services grew 9% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, as well as positive growth across all 3 geographies, led by a double-digit growth in Europe. Communications media and technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected the continued strong overall growth in North America and the growth markets. In Europe, we did see contraction driven primarily by communications. Finally, resources growth was flat in the quarter, as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continued to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities, which is benefiting from clients investments to digitize their businesses. 
Moving down the income statement. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last year. Sales marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 4 last year. 
In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apex Partners, we closed our [indiscernible] transaction. This transaction, along with a immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of, lowered our quarter 4 tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase. Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31 last year. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. 
We ended the year with a global headcount of about 384,000 people. Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up 1% from quarter 3 and up 2% from the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents an 11% -- $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. 
I am extremely pleased that we continued our track record of successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% local currency for the full year, well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups, geographies and businesses. We are very pleased with double-digit growth in products, H&PS and financial services, as well as, overall, in both North America and Europe. 
From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations, with very good mid-single-digit growth in application services. And of course, across the board, we saw a double-digit growth in the new, estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by digital-related services, with estimated growth of approximately 30%. 
Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal '15 adjusted operating margin and within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments on our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity, resulting from improvements in our underlying profitability. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY '15 and was above the upper end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong top line growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1. And finally, we delivered on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions, and returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders. 
So again, following a very strong year in fiscal '15, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows, and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our outstanding performance in fiscal 2016 demonstrate that our growth strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are clearly executing very well. We are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the last few years to align Accenture alongside the existing businesses, to transform the services we offer and to increase our investments in new and high-growth areas. This is all that's driving the differentiation for Accenture and making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in the new digital world. Our 5 businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Cognizant Technology and Accenture Operations, are each highly competitive in their own right, as well as synergistic in delivering value for our clients. Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace, from being relevant in the boardroom, to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms, to operating services on behalf of clients, to drive tangible outcomes. At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer [indiscernible] business rapidly to what we call ""The New"" digital, cloud and security-related services, which, together, accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in 2016. That is a substantial increase from asset symmetry, 30% of revenues, [indiscernible]. 
Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients onwards ""The New"". 
In digital, we are working with many hotels, European hospitality company to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all channels through data-driven customer segmentation. In just one year, sales up[ph] of 27% and more than 1 million people are showing [indiscernible] , In, we are helping Rio Tinto, a global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the public cloud, including the world's largest S&P production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with another service model. And in security, our side of experts are working with large U.S. utility to define, develop and run the next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy towards this risk, managed identity and enable [indiscernible] for cyber threat in real-time. 
We continue to make significant investments across our business, particularly in acquisitions. In fiscal '16, we invented more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions, and that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when we look at these last 2 years, I am delighted that about 70% of our investment in acquisitions are being in the new. In the fourth quarter alone, we'll announce 5 acquisitions in the new, including 3 digital services companies: Technologica in Spain and Germany, and 2 security companies: in Israel, at and in Australia. 
We continued to see strong demand from our clients for large scale mission-critical program. The broad range of services we provide across our 5 businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continue to differentiate Accenture. And we remain the partner of choice for the world-leading company. 
For Stryker, the medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We are leveraging the Accenture SAP business solution group to build the solution on, styling sales, logistics, supply chain and procurements. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. 
I'm delighted as we delivered another year of strong and balanced growth around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in both North America and Europe, as well as in many of all other countries. 
In North America, we delivered 11% growth in local currency, driven by the United States where we have now delivered double-digit growth of 5 of the last 6 years. In Europe, we grew even 11% in local currency, with double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany, as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan, as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few source on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our business and to create solutions for clients. 
In today's fast changing environment where companies need to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking innovation-led approach to drive more value for our clients and help them invent the future. Our approach to innovation spans everything we do, from Accenture Research where we identify market and technology trends, to Accenture Ventures where we invest in growth stage companies, to the Accenture Labs where we incubate and prototype new concepts through supply R&D, to Accenture where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility. Our unique approach, with the Accenture innovation architecture, enables us to combine our capabilities across the company to invent, develop and deliver these innovations for clients and to sell them faster. 
So as we enter fiscal year '17, we have momentum in our business. And you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities for the future in order to deliver strong, durable and profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year '17 and then take your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter[ph]. David, over to you."

Let me now turn to our business outlook. 
For the first quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.65 billion. This assumes the impacts of FX will be about flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal '16 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal '16. 
For the full fiscal '17, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. 
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range includes an estimated benefit of less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. 
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98 or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. 
For the full fiscal '17, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

Thank you for the question. As you've heard Pierre and me say several times over the last really couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investments in our business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and also position ourselves for long-term market leadership beyond just the year that we're in. And when you look at the 10 to 30 basis point range, that's a range that we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million. And so when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of investments that we made in the business, and it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be clear, our investments were significantly higher, I'm talking about on the margin, even a little higher than the otherwise would have been, which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points. So it's simply a reflection of the fact that we are managing a large investment pool in the business, and on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let's say, being at the low end or the upper end, but we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We created significantly more expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund really a material level of investments overall. So we are quite pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will."

That means that in '16, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly 3x the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of the power of our strategy, and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we're doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5 overall growth, let's say, a 4.5% in that range. Now offsetting that, so a higher risk profile in the macro, the market growth, as I called out, is the fact that we're starting this year with a high level of confidence. We continued to see strong momentum in our business. And that's a reflection of the things that we've done very uniquely and positioning our business for the market of today and the market that we see in the future. When you look at what we've done organizing around 5 distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as leaders in their own right individually, but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly differentiated way, when you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to the new, meeting those new and emerging needs of our clients, all of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there. All of that continues to come together in a powerful way, and we're very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year. All that translates in the 5% to 8% growth. As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of possibilities. We always work hard everyday to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be higher than market growth than we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, of which would be quite a strong result. So hopefully, that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance."

So we have, let's say, a more practical view, but yet still a view of strong double-digit growth at this point.

If you look at our 5 operating groups, so against the 5% to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have products, which is the operating group that is positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it's likely that products would deliver a level of growth that is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture. Now will it be as high as it was in '16? I don't think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very, very strong. On the other end of the spectrum, we have resources. And resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy, and chemicals and natural resources. I would say no different than what we saw last year. We also continued to expect utilities to be a very strong performer for us. But on balance, when you net that together, we think it's likely that resources, it's going to be below that 5% to 8% range, still flat to positive growth, but below that range. And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continued to expect strong growth for those 3 operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons, the growth will be, let's say, lower than the growth that several of those operating groups delivered in '16. Still very healthy growth, mind you, and growth that represents taking share in the case of all 3 of those. But at this point, in our guidance, we are not assuming that those 3 operating groups will deliver above the 8%. So when you say what's different, with products that's more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year, resources continues to have the headwinds with the 2 verticals in particular, and then the other 3 operating groups, we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might have said 18% for products. I meant to say 15%, I misspoke on that, so they were 15% for the year."

We have a very strong practice. We have a strong leadership, a great team broadly. And I think it just speaks again to the differentiation that we have, in this case, in Financial Services Europe, and the extent to which they are really bringing the full power of our strategy to serve our clients which have a variety of needs. I think as -- if I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in Financial Services that continued to be present in the fourth quarter and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean the first demand driver, first of all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, Financial Services is a very technology intensive sector, especially if you're thinking about banking and capital markets, specifically. Within that, I would say the 3 demand drivers continued to be significant investment in digitizing the customer channels. So what we refer to, the sector refers to as distribution and marketing. There are significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank. Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there is significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let's say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing really the enterprise, but especially the channel. And then the third driver will be risk and regulatory broadly where we have a market-leading capability and that serves us very well. When you look at the fourth quarter, all 3 of those things were at play globally, but certainly in Europe. And we think we are well positioned. And we think that banks, and in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth, and we are well positioned to help them with that. When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter, and we don't see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we, along with everyone else, continued to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years, to come. And so we watch that very closely. We are not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk, and we are working hard to anticipate those should they occur and then respond accordingly."

The tax rate, the accounting change for the tax rate for share based compensation gives us a benefit because, effectively, we get a higher tax deduction when the share price at the time that a share is delivered is higher than the price at the time that the share was granted. And so in this environment where we've had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which, as I called out, was just under 2%. So to ask your -- to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price continues to appreciate, such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was when the time we granted. So you can take a point of view on where you think our share price will head and then that will inform you as to whether or not that would benefit us going forward. On the headcount, was the second part of your question, for -- as you look forward to next year, there is an interesting evolution, if you will, in how we talk about headcount even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on these 5 distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent, strategy and supply demand model, it's a little bit -- it's more nuance, if you will, in terms of how we communicate headcount related data. And so what I would say in general is that we have a history of carrying to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively. Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really industry-leading levels. And so as we look forward, our headcount is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is good as anyone in our industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that we've provided for on our guidance."

And so when you use the word core, just to level set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it's not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""The New"" so you are talking abo",512,"Yes. So that's a very good question, I'm glad you asked it. And so when you use the word core, just to level set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it's not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""The New"" so you are talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there, and Pierre has made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with ""The New""and the 60% that we identify outside of ""The New"". And so again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security. So the point is, is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business. And our goal, just as it is in ""The New"", is to grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we just completed, we estimate that our core grew -- had positive growth, albeit in the single digit, low-single-digit range as by design, the vast majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy, but nonetheless, our core business continued to grow, and we estimate that it grew faster than the market and we took share. And we invest for that growth and we focus on it as a key part of our business. An example of that would be something that, again, I think, Pierre has referenced, who leads technology. He's talked about this in different forums, but an example of that would be the investment that we've made in our MOD wizard platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core application services work through the use of a automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents in the case of this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective. When you look at, for example, some of the investments that we've made in our strategy and consulting business. While strategy and consulting business is focused on the new, consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our strategy in consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call new. When you look at the investments that we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives us an industry-leading strategy capability in the resell sector and it really strengthens our position there. Certainly, a part of that investment benefits us in ""The New"", but there's a part of that investment of that is the core strategy capability in retail that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So we invest in both parts of the business. And in both cases, our intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share."

Now having said that, why would it be different? And then this -- I don't want this to sound negative because, in fact, we're very positive, but when you think about the [indiscernible] of the quarter and when you think about the operating groups and the industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases, not only for the last year, but for the last 2 years, right, as confident as we are in many of our industries, as we sit here in the first month of the year to assume that all of those industries and all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary double-digit growth for a third year in a row, which is probably wouldn't be prudent. Now does that mean that we don't have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners aren't working hard everyday to hit the repeat button and do again what they've done in the last 2 years? Absolutely not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally, and that's what's reflected in our guidance. And again, that's not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don't. We think it's very good guidance in the context of the market growth, and it's entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster than the market. But if some of these industries have strong, but, let's say, lower growth than they've had the last 2 years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range and that is the possibility in several of our industries."

What's driving that assumption is that we don't see anything as we sit here today that would fundamentally change the dynamics that we see in the market, let's say, as we look out over the next 4 quarters. We see more of the same. And what we see is an organic market that would continue to grow in that 2.5% range, which means that we are making our own market through our differentiation, the uniqueness of our strategy, leveraging the power of our investments to drive our level of organic growth that is meaningfully higher than that to take share, but we don't see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%. So in other words, we're not speculating on -- you pick your black swan of the day, we're not speculating on some black swan event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of something like that should it occur. In terms of the -- again, I'm almost to use the word deceleration because, in almost all cases, our growth ambitions for the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels, than, in many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we've had the last year, if not 2 years. And so deceleration, what I would say, for many of our verticals, we've assumed lower, but still strong growth, it's the way I would characterize it. Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don't see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to continue to be tougher. Let's say continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we have seen some pressure in communications in Europe in particular. And although we are very pleased with our growth in Financial Services, in Banking and Capital Markets specifically, I would say that is an industry that we are watching through Richard Lumb's leadership. We are watching very, very carefully and very closely."

What I can say is that the resiliency flowing back up, a key tenet of our strategy, our growth strategy, is to create durability and resiliency in our business, and that is reflected in our focus across 5 businesses. It's focused in our investments to lead in ""The New? and it's focused in -- and it's rooted in the focused, but diverse portfolio that we have across industries and across geographies. And whereas maybe some of our competitors, you can apply this to who you want, are more dependent on 1 or 2 or 3 verticals and 1 or 2 markets, that's not the case with Accenture. And that is, in fact, the differentiator and probably colors our comments in our results versus some of our competitors, all of whom we respect, but yet we think we are differentiated for the reasons that I mentioned. Again, in addition to chemicals and energy and natural resources, we've got our eye on communications, in Europe in particular. And while we haven't seen any impacts at this point in banking and capital markets, we're not blind to the dynamics of the Brexit and how it could evolve. And Richard Lumb, who is our Group Chief Executive for Financial Services, is very focused on staying on top of that, and we'll see how it plays out, but I would say, so far, so good. Right. Thank you very much. 
Okay, so let me just close out the call and thank everyone again for joining us on the call. Hope you found it helpful and insightful. As we enter fiscal '17, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business, with the differentiated capabilities we are building, our continued rotation to ""The New"" and our disciplined management of the business, we are very confident in our ability to continue gaining market share and driving profitable growth. On behalf of Pierre and our entire leadership team, I want to thank all Accenture people around the world for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our clients in our business and to delivering another excellent year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to KC. Thank you."

So David and I decided to prerecord our remarks, and then he will be available to take your questions at the end of the call. 
Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I am particularly pleased with our durable and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 2 years in a row and we have gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We've generated record revenues of $32.9 billion with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted basis, an 11% increase. Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 10 basis point on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1 billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend. 
So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our business, which clearly reflect the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day. Now let me hand over to David."
972190,368244186,1051729,"Accenture plc, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 29, 2016",2016-09-29,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforced our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a lead",1545,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforced our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to ""the New"", including digital, cloud and security. By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal '16 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal '15. 
At a high level, our quarter 4 results continued to reflect strong performance across all 3 of our financial imperatives: durable revenue growth faster than the market; sustainable margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people; and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. To be more specific, quarter 4 represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth with continued significant gains in market share. 
Our net revenue growth of just over 9% local currency was broad-based and balanced across most dimensions of our business. Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from quarter 4 of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability, which enabled us to invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter. And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
So we finished the year in a manner which was very consistent with the previous 3 quarters with strong, broad-based growth, underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. And outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital-related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. 
The trends in revenue growth across our 5 businesses were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined as well as operations posted another quarter of double-digit growth while application services delivered very solid growth in the mid-single-digit range. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New"", led by digital-related services.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of ""the New"" across all of the industries within Products. And our investments over the past few years are serving us very well in meeting the new demands of our clients. H&PS posted another strong quarter with 11% growth, driven by continued double-digit growth in health and overall in North America and the growth markets. Financial Services grew 9% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets as well as positive growth across all 3 geographies, led by double-digit growth in Europe. 
Communications, Media & Technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected the continued strong overall growth in North America and the growth markets. In Europe, we did see contraction driven primarily by communications. Finally, Resources growth was flat in the quarter as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continue to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities, which is benefiting from clients' investments to digitize their businesses. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 4 last year. 
In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apax Partners, we closed our Duck Creek transaction. This transaction, along with a immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of Navitaire, lowered our quarter 4 tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31 last year. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the year with a global headcount of about 384,000 people. Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up 1% from quarter 3 and up 2% from the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents an 11% -- $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. I'm extremely pleased that we continued our track record of successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% in local currency for the full year, well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups, geographies and businesses. We were very pleased with double-digit growth in Products, H&PS and Financial Services as well as overall in both North America and Europe. From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined as well as operations with very good mid-single-digit growth in application services. And of course, across the board, we saw double-digit growth in ""the New"", estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by digital-related services with estimated growth of approximately 30%. 
Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal '15 adjusted operating margin and within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments on our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity, resulting from improvements in our underlying profitability. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY '15 and was above the upper end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong top line growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1. And finally, we delivered on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions, and returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders. 
So again, following a very strong year in fiscal '15, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our outstanding performance in fiscal '16 demonstrate that our growth strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are clearly executing very well. We are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the last few years to align Accenture along 5 distinct businesses, to transform the services we offer and to increase our investments in new and high-growth areas. This is all that's driving differentiation for Accenture and making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in the new digital world. 
Our 5 businesses, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, are each highly competitive in their own right as well as synergistic in delivering value for our clients. Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace, from being relevant in the boardroom to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms, to operating services on behalf of clients to drive tangible outcomes. At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer, rotating our business rapidly to what we call ""the New"": digital, cloud and security-related services, which together, accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in 2016. That is a substantial increase from [indiscernible] symmetry, 30% of revenues just a year ago.
Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients on with ""the New"". In digital, we are working with many hotels, the European hospitality companies, to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all channels through data-driven customer segmentation. In just 1 year, direct sales are up 27% and more than 1 million people are enjoying Marriott Rewards program In cloud, we are helping Río Tinto, a global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the public cloud, including the world's largest SAP production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with an As-a-Service model. And in security, our cyber experts are working with a large U.S.-based utility to define, develop and run a next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to assess risk, manage identity and enable alerts for cyber threats in real time. 
We continue to make significant investments across our business, particularly in acquisitions. In fiscal '16, we invested more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions. And that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when we look at these last 2 years, I'm delighted that about 70% of our investments in acquisitions have been in ""the New"". In the fourth quarter alone, we announced 5 acquisitions in ""the New"", including 3 digital services companies: MOBGEN in the Netherlands, Tecnilógica in Spain and dgroup in Germany; and 2 security companies: Maglan in Israel and Redcore in Australia. 
We continue to see the strong demand from our clients for large-scale mission-critical transformation programs. The broad range of services we provide across our 5 businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to differentiate Accenture. And we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. For Stryker, the medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We are leveraging the Accenture, SAP Business Solutions Group to build a solution on S/4HANA spanning finance, sales, logistics, supply chain and procurement. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm delighted as we delivered another year of strong and balanced growth around the world with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in both North America and Europe as well as in many of all other countries. In North America, we delivered 11% growth in local currency, driven by the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth for 5 of the last 6 years. In Europe, we grew even 11% in local currency with double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our business and to create cutting-edge solutions for clients. In today's fast-changing environment where companies need to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive more value for our clients and help them invent the future. Our approach to innovation spans everything we do: from Accenture Research [ph], where we identify market and technology trends; to Accenture Ventures, where we invest in growth-stage companies; to the Accenture Labs, where we incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D; to Accenture [indiscernible], where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility. 
Our unique approach with the Accenture innovation architecture enables us to combine our capabilities across the company to invent, develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients and [indiscernible]. So as we enter fiscal year '17, we have momentum in our business. And you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities for the future in order to deliver strong, durable and profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year '17, and then take your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. David, over to you."

For the full fiscal '17, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range includes an estimated benefit of less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98 or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '17, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so that we could take your questions. KC?"

Thank you for the questions. As you've heard Pierre and me say several times over the last really couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investment in our business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to also position ourselves for long-term market leadership beyond just the year that we're in. And when you look at the 10 to 30 basis point range, that's a range that we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million. And so when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of investments that we made in the business, and it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be clear, our investments were significantly higher, I'm talking about on the margin, even a little higher than they otherwise would have been, which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points. So it's simply a reflection of the fact that we're managing a large investment pool in the business. And on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let's say, being at the low end or the upper end. But we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We've created significantly more expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund really a material level of investments overall. So we are quite pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will."

Well, let me just take a minute and just frame how we see the environment, and then how that relates to our guidance. I think, first of all, and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone on this call, in balance, we see the overall macro environment being more volatile, let's say, at this time than where it was a year ago entering fiscal '16. So we see a higher level of volatility overall in the macro environment for the reasons that this group understands very well. Having said that in that context, our guidance assumes that the market growth, and when I reference market growth, I'm talking about the basket of publicly traded companies, we expect for purposes of managing our business and the outlook that the market growth is going to be very similar in '17 to what we saw in '16. And in '16, to be clear, we saw organic growth in the basket of publicly traded companies of about 2.5%. Now just to pause on that point for a minute, that means that in '16, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly 3x the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of the power of our strategy and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we're doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5%, overall growth, let's say, of 4.5% in that range. Now offsetting that, so a higher risk profile in the macro, the market growth as I called out, is the fact that we're starting this year with a high level of confidence. We continue to see strong momentum in our business. And that's a reflection of the things that we have done very uniquely in positioning our business for the market of today and the market that we see in the future. When you look at what we've done organizing around 5 distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as leaders in their own right individually but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly differentiated way, when you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to ""the New"", meeting those new and emerging needs of our clients, all of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there, all of that continues to come together in a powerful way. And we're very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year. All that translates into 5% to 8% growth. As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of possibilities. We always work hard every day to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be higher than market growth than we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, which would be quite a strong result. So hopefully, that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance."

If you look at our 5 operating groups against the 5% to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have Products, which is the operating group that is positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it's likely that Products would deliver a level of growth that is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture. Now will it be as high as it was in '16? I don't think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very, very strong. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Resources. And Resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy and chemicals and natural resources, I would say no different than what we saw last year. We also continue to expect utilities to be a very strong performer for us. But on balance, when you net that together, we think it's likely that Resources is going to be below that 5% to 8% range, still flat to positive growth but below that range. And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continue to expect strong growth for those 3 operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons, the growth will be, let's say, lower than the strong growth that several of those operating groups delivered in '16. Still very healthy growth, mind you, and growth that represents taking share in the case of all 3 of those. But at this point in our guidance, we're not assuming that those 3 operating groups would deliver above the 8%. So when you say what's different, with Products, it's more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year. Resources continues to have the headwinds with the 2 verticals in particular. And then the other 3 operating groups, we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might have said 18% for Products, I meant to say 15%. I misspoke on that. So they were 15% for the year."

I think probably more interesting is to talk about it through the dimensions of our businesses. We see strategy and consulting combined in the mid- to high single-digit range.

We have a very strong practice. We have a strong leadership, a great team broadly. And I think it just speaks again to the differentiation that we have, in this case, in Financial Services Europe, and the extent to which they are really bringing the full power of our strategy to serve our clients, which have a variety of needs. I think as -- if I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in Financial Services that continued to be present in the fourth quarter and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean, the first demand driver -- first of all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, Financial Services is a very technology-intensive sector, especially if you're thinking about banking and capital markets, specifically. Within that, I would say the 3 demand drivers continue to be significant investment in digitizing the customer channels, so what we refer to, the sector refers to as distribution and marketing. There are significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank. Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there's significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let's say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing really the enterprise but especially the channel. And then a third driver would be risk and regulatory broadly, where we have a market-leading capability and that serves us very well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, all 3 of those things were at play globally but certainly in Europe. And we think we're well positioned. And we think that banks, in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth. And we are well positioned to help them with that. When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter and we don't see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we, along with everyone else, continue to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years, to come. And so we watch that very closely. We're not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk. And we are working hard to anticipate those, should they occur, and then respond accordingly."

The tax rate, the accounting change for the tax rate for share-based compensation gives us a benefit because effectively we get a higher tax deduction when the share price at the time that a share is delivered is higher than the price at the time that the share was granted. And so in this environment, where we've had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which as I called out, was just under 2%. So to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price continues to appreciate, such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was at the time we granted. So you can take a point of view on where you think our share price will head, and then that would inform you as to whether or not that would benefit us going forward. On the headcount, was the second part of your question, as you look forward to next year, there is an interesting evolution, if you will, on how we talk about headcount even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on these 5 distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent, strategy and supply/demand model, it's a little bit -- it's more nuanced, if you will, in terms of how we communicate headcount-related data. And so what I would say in general is that we have a history of harrying to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively. Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really at industry-leading levels. And so as we look forward, our headcount is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is as good as anyone in our industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that we've provided for on our guidance."

And so when you use the word core, just to level-set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""the New"". So you're talking ab",511,"Yes. So that's a very good question, I'm glad you asked it. And so when you use the word core, just to level-set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""the New"". So you're talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there, and Pierre has made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with ""the New"" and the 60% that we identify outside of ""the New"". And so again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security. So the point is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business. And our goal, just as it is in ""the New"", is to grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we have just completed, we estimate that our core grew, had positive growth, albeit in the single-digit, low single-digit range as by design, the vast majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy. But nonetheless, our core business continued to grow, and we estimate that it grew faster than the market and we took share. And we invest for that growth and we focus on it as a key part of our business. An example of that would be something that again, I think, Pierre has referenced. Bhaskar Ghosh, who leads technology, has talked about this in different forums. But an example of that would be the investment that we've made in our myWizard platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core application services work through the use of an automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents, in the case of this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective. When you look at, for example, some of the investments that we've made in our strategy and consulting business, while strategy and consulting business is focused on ""the New"", consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our strategy and consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call ""the New"". When you look at the investments that we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives us an industry-leading strategy capability in the retail sector and really strengthens our position there, certainly a part of that investment benefits us in ""the New"". But there's a part of that investment that is the core strategy capability in retail that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So we invest in both parts of the business. And in both cases, our intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share."

I would say, across the board, universally, we are on the low end of the curve, if you will. Or to say differently, we are in the early innings of the adoption curve. And so these are ways that we think have a lot of runway in front of them. Paul Daugherty would give you a more eloquent view as our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Technology Strategist. But I feel comfortable that he would say that, certainly this is a decade-long, if not beyond a decade-long adoption curve for these new technologies and really, the profound impact that they will each have on the way global businesses and governments operate. And so I would say we're early stage in the adoption. And this wave has a long runway in front of it."

Given the momentum though you're describing and the fact that these are in early stage of adoption and ""the New"" is an increasingly large component of your base, why would you think the business would decelerate this year?"

Now having said that, why would it be different? And then -- I don't want this to sound negative because, in fact, we're very positive. But when you think about month 1 of the quarter and when you think about the operating groups and the industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases, not only for the last year but for the last 2 years, right, as confident as we are in many of our industries, as we sit here in the first month of the year to assume that all of those industries and all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary double-digit growth for a third year in a row would just probably wouldn't be prudent. Now does that mean that we don't have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners aren't working hard every day to hit the repeat button and do again what they've done in the last 2 years? Absolutely not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally. And that's what's reflected in our guidance. And again, that's not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don't. We think it's very good guidance in the context of the market growth and it's entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster than the market. But if some of these industries have strong but, let's say, lower growth than they've had the last 2 years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range. And that is the possibility in several of our industries."

If I understood your comments about the verticals correctly, it sounds like all of the verticals except energy could be somewhat weaker in its growth in fiscal '17 versus '16. And energy has been challenged, so it probably stays somewhat challenged. But the other verticals, it sounds like, will decelerate. And then you also mentioned that you're assuming the market rate of growth will hold up in fiscal '17 at the same rate as in fiscal '16. And so I just wanted to, one, clarify, is that the assumption about the verticals that they'll generally be somewhat slower this year than last? And then on the market, I just want to understand the assumption that it will -- the growth rate will hold up at its current level. What's driving that assumption?"

So I'll start at the end, and then work back. What's driving that assumption is that we don't see anything as we sit here today that would fundamentally change the dynamics that we see in the market, let's say, as we look out over the next 4 quarters. We see more of the same. And what we see is an organic market that would continue to grow in that 2.5% range, which means that we are making our own market through our differentiation, the uniqueness of our strategy, leveraging the power of our investments to drive a level of organic growth that is meaningfully higher than that to take share. But we don't see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%. So in other words, we're not speculating on -- you pick your black swan of the day, we're not speculating on some black swan event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of something like that, should it occur. In terms of the -- again, I almost hate to use the word deceleration because in almost all cases, our growth ambitions for the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels than, in many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we've had the last year, if not 2 years. And so deceleration, what I would say for many of our verticals, we've assumed lower but still strong growth is the way I would characterize it. Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don't see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to continue to be tougher, let's say, continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we have seen some pressure in communications in Europe in particular. And although we are very pleased with our growth in Financial Services, in banking and capital markets specifically, I would say that is an industry that we are watching, through Richard Lumb's leadership, we are watching very, very carefully and very closely."

Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I am particularly pleased with our durable and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth for 2 years in a row and we have gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We generated record revenues of $32.9 billion with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted basis, an 11% increase. Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 10 basis point on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1 billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend. 
So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our business, which clearly reflect the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day. Now let me hand over to David."

We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leade",1544,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to ""the New"", including digital, cloud and security. By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal '16 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal '15. 
At a high level, our quarter 4 results continued to reflect strong performance across all 3 of our financial imperatives: durable revenue growth faster than the market; sustainable margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people; and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. To be more specific, quarter 4 represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth with continued significant gains in market share. 
Our net revenue growth of just over 9% local currency was broad-based and balanced across most dimensions of our business. Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from quarter 4 of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability, which enabled us to invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter. And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
So we finished the year in a manner which was very consistent with the previous 3 quarters, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. And outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital-related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. 
The trends in revenue growth across our 5 businesses were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations posted another quarter of double-digit growth, while application services delivered very solid growth in the mid-single-digit range. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New,"" led by digital-related services.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of ""the New"" across all of the industries within Products. And our investments over the past few years are serving us very well in meeting the new demands of our clients. H&PS posted another strong quarter with 11% growth, driven by continued double-digit growth in health and overall in North America and the growth markets. Financial Services grew 9% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets as well as positive growth across all 3 geographies, led by double-digit growth in Europe. 
Communications, Media & Technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected continued strong overall growth in North America and the growth markets. In Europe, we did see contraction, driven primarily by communications. Finally, Resources growth was flat in the quarter as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continue to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities, which is benefiting from clients' investments to digitize their businesses. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 4 last year. 
In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apax Partners, we closed our Duck Creek transaction. This transaction, along with an immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of Navitaire, lowered our quarter 4 tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31 last year. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the year with a global headcount of about 384,000 people. Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up 1% from quarter 3 and up 2% from the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents an 11% -- $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. I'm extremely pleased that we continued our track record of successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% in local currency for the full year, well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups, geographies and businesses. We were very pleased with double-digit growth in Products, H&PS and Financial Services as well as overall in both North America and Europe. From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined as well as operations with very good mid-single-digit growth in application services. And of course, across the board, we saw double-digit growth in ""the New,"" estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by digital-related services with estimated growth of approximately 30%. 
Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal '15 adjusted operating margin and within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments in our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity, resulting from improvements in our underlying profitability. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY '15 and was above the upper end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong top line growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1. And finally, we delivered on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions, and returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders. 
So again, following a very strong year in fiscal '15, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our outstanding performance in fiscal '16 demonstrate that our growth strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are clearly executing very well. We are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the last few years to align Accenture along 5 distinct businesses, to transform the services we offer and to increase our investment in new and high-growth areas. This is all that's driving differentiation for Accenture and making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in the new digital world. 
Our 5 businesses, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, are each highly competitive in their own right as well as synergistic in delivering value for our clients. Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace, from being relevant in the boardroom to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms, to operating services on behalf of clients to drive tangible outcomes. At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer, rotating our business rapidly to what we call ""the New"": digital, cloud and security-related services, which together, accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in 2016. That is a substantial increase from approximately 30% of revenues just a year ago.
Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients on with ""the New."" In digital, we are working with Meliá hotels, the European hospitality company, to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all channels through data-driven customer segmentation. In just 1 year, direct sales are up 27%, and more than 1 million people have enjoyed Meliá Rewards program In cloud, we are helping Río Tinto, a global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the public cloud, including the world's largest SAP production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with an As-a-Service model. And in security, our cyber experts are working with a large U.S.-based utility to define, develop and run a next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to assess risk, manage identity and enable alerts for cyber threats in real time. 
We continue to make significant investments across our business, particularly in acquisitions. In fiscal year '16, we invested more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions. And that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when we look at these last 2 years, I'm delighted that about 70% of our investment in acquisitions have been in ""the New."" In the fourth quarter alone, we announced 5 acquisitions in ""the New,"" including 3 digital services companies: MOBGEN in the Netherlands, Tecnilógica in Spain and dgroup in Germany; and 2 security companies: Maglan in Israel and Redcore in Australia. 
We continue to see strong demand from our clients for large-scale mission-critical transformation programs. The broad range of services we provide across our 5 businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to differentiate Accenture. And we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. For Stryker, the medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We are leveraging the Accenture, SAP Business Solutions Group to build a solution on S/4HANA spanning finance, sales, logistics, supply chain and procurement. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm delighted as we delivered another year of strong and balanced growth around the world with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in both North America and Europe as well as in many of all other countries. In North America, we delivered 11% growth in local currency, driven by the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth for 5 of the last 6 years. In Europe, we grew revenue 11% in local currency with double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our business and to create cutting-edge solutions for clients. In today's fast-changing environment where companies need to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive more value for our clients and help them invent the future. Our approach to innovation spans everything we do: from Accenture Research [ph], where we identify market and technology trends; to Accenture Ventures, where we invest in growth-stage companies; to the Accenture Labs, where we incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D; to Accenture Studios, where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility. 
Our unique approach with the Accenture innovation architecture enables us to combine our capabilities across the company to invent, develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients and [indiscernible]. So as we enter fiscal year '17, we have momentum in our business. And you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities for the future in order to deliver strong, durable and profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year '17, and then take your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. David, over to you."

For the first quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal '16 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal '16. 
For the full fiscal '17, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range includes an estimated benefit of less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98 or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '17, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

As you've heard Pierre and me say several times over the last really couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investment in our business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to also position ourselves for long-term market leadership beyond just the year that we're in. And when you look at the 10 to 30 basis point range, that's a range that we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million. And so when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of investment that we made in the business, and it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be clear, our investments were significantly higher, I'm talking about on the margin, even a little higher than they otherwise would have been, which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points. So it's simply a reflection of the fact that we're managing a large investment pool in the business. And on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let's say, being at the low end or the upper end. But we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We've created significantly more expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund, really, a material level of investments overall. So we are quite pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will."

Well, let me just take a minute and just frame how we see the environment and then how that relates to our guidance. I think, first of all, and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone on this call, in balance, we see the overall macro environment being more volatile, let's say, at this time than where it was a year ago entering fiscal '16. So we see a higher level of volatility overall in the macro environment for the reasons that this group understands very well. Having said that, in that context our guidance assumes that the market growth, and when I reference market growth, I'm talking about the basket of publicly traded companies, we expect for purposes of managing our business and the outlook that the market growth is going to be very similar in '17 to what we saw in '16. And in '16, to be clear, we saw organic growth in the basket of publicly traded companies of about 2.5%. Now just to pause on that point for a minute, that means that in '16, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly 3x the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of the power of our strategy and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we're doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5%, overall growth, let's say, of 4.5% in that range. Now offsetting that, so a higher risk profile in the macro, the market growth as I called out, is the fact that we're starting this year with a high level of confidence. We continue to see strong momentum in our business. And that's a reflection of the things that we have done very uniquely in positioning our business for the market of today and the market that we see in the future. When you look at what we've done organizing around 5 distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as leaders in their own right individually but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly differentiated way, when you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to ""the New,"" meeting those new and emerging needs of our clients, all of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there, all of that continues to come together in a powerful way. And we're very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year. All that translates into 5% to 8% growth. As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of possibilities. We always work hard every day to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be higher than market growth than we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, which would be quite a strong result. So hopefully, that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance."

If you look at our 5 operating groups against the 5% to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have Products, which is the operating group that is positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it's likely that Products would deliver a level of growth that is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture. Now will it be as high as it was in '16? I don't think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very, very strong. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Resources. And Resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy and chemicals and natural resources, I would say no different than what we saw last year. We also continue to expect utilities to be a very strong performer for us. But on balance, when you net that together, we think it's likely that Resources is going to be below that 5% to 8% range, still flat to positive growth but below that range. And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continue to expect strong growth for those 3 operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons the growth will be, let's say, lower than the strong growth that several of those operating groups delivered in '16. Still very healthy growth, mind you, and growth that represents taking share in the case of all 3 of those. But at this point in our guidance, we're not assuming that those 3 operating groups would deliver above the 8%. So when you say what's different, with Products, it's more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year. Resources continues to have the headwinds with the 2 verticals in particular. And then the other 3 operating groups we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might have said 18% for Products, I meant to say 15%. I misspoke on that. So they were 15% for the year."

I think as -- if I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in Financial Services that continued to be present in the fourth quarter and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean, the first demand driver -- first of all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, Financial Services is a very technology-intensive sector, especially if you're thinking about banking and capital markets, specifically. Within that, I would say the 3 demand drivers continue to be significant investment in digitizing the customer channels, so what we refer to, the sector refers to as distribution and marketing. There are significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank. Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there's significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let's say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing, really, the enterprise but especially the channel. And then a third driver would be risk and regulatory broadly, where we have market-leading capability, and that serves us very well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, all 3 of those things were at play globally but certainly in Europe. And we think we're well positioned. And we think that banks, in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth. And we are well positioned to help them with that. When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter and we don't see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we, along with everyone else, continue to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years, to come. And so we watch that very closely. We're not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk. And we are working hard to anticipate those, should they occur, and then respond accordingly."

And so in this environment, where we've had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which as I called out, was just under 2%. So to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price continues to appreciate, such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was at the time we granted. And so you can take a point of view on where you think our share price will head, and then that would inform you as to whether or not that would benefit us going forward. On the headcount, was the second part of your question. As you look forward to next year, there is an interesting evolution, if you will, on how we talk about headcount even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on these 5 distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent, strategy and supply/demand model, it's a little bit -- it's more nuanced, if you will, in terms of how we communicate headcount-related data. And so what I would say in general is that we have a history of haring to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively. Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really at industry-leading levels. And so as we look forward, our headcount is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is as good as anyone in our industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that we've provided for on our guidance."

And so when you use the word core, just to level-set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""the New."" So you're talking ab",509,"Yes. So that's a very good question, I'm glad you asked it. And so when you use the word core, just to level-set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""the New."" So you're talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there, and Pierre has made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with ""the New"" and the 60% that we identify outside of ""the New."" So again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security. So the point is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business. And our goal, just as it is in ""the New,"" is to grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we just completed, we estimate that our core grew, had positive growth, albeit in the single-digit, low single-digit range as by design, the vast majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy. But nonetheless, our core business continued to grow, and we estimate that it grew faster than the market and we took share. And we invest for that growth and we focus on it as a key part of our business. An example of that would be something that again, I think, Pierre has referenced. Bhaskar Ghosh, who leads technology, has talked about this in different forums. But an example of that would be the investment that we've made in our myWizard platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core application services work through the use of an automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents, in the case of this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective. When you look at, for example, some of the investments that we've made in our strategy and consulting business, while strategy and consulting business is focused on ""the New,"" consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our strategy and consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call ""the New."" When you look at the investments that we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives us an industry-leading strategy capability in the retail sector and really strengthens our position there, certainly a part of that investment benefits us in ""the New."" But there's a part of that investment that is the core strategy capability in retail that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So we invest in both parts of the business. And in both cases, our intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share."

Now having said that, why would it be different? And then -- I don't want this to sound negative because, in fact, we're very positive. But when you think about month 1 of the quarter and when you think about the operating groups and the industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases, not only for the last year but for the last 2 years, right? As confident as we are in many of our industries as we sit here in the first month of the year, to assume that all of those industries and all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary double-digit growth for a third year in a row would just -- probably wouldn't be prudent. Now does that mean that we don't have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners aren't working hard every day to hit the repeat button and do again what they've done the last 2 years? Absolutely not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally. And that's what's reflected in our guidance. And again, that's not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don't. We think it's very good guidance in the context of the market growth, and it's entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster than the market. But if some of these industries have strong but, let's say, lower growth than they've had the last 2 years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range. And that is the possibility in several of our industries."

If I understood your comments about the verticals correctly, it sounds like all of the verticals except energy could be somewhat weaker in its growth in fiscal '17 versus '16. And energy has been challenged, so it probably stays somewhat challenged. But the other verticals, it sounds like, will decelerate. And then you also mentioned that you're assuming the market rate of growth will hold up in fiscal '17 at the same rate as in fiscal '16. And so I just wanted to, one, clarify, is that the assumption about the verticals that they'll generally be somewhat slower this year than last? And then on the market, I just want to understand the assumption that it will -- the growth rate will hold up at its current level. What's driving that assumption?"

So I'll start at the end, and then work back. What's driving that assumption is that we don't see anything as we sit here today that would fundamentally change the dynamics that we see in the market, let's say, as we look out over the next 4 quarters. We see more of the same. And what we see is an organic market that would continue to grow in that 2.5% range, which means that we are making our own market through our differentiation, the uniqueness of our strategy, leveraging the power of our investments to drive a level of organic growth that is meaningfully higher than that to take share. But we don't see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%. So in other words, we're not speculating on -- you pick your black swan of the day, we're not speculating on some black swan event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of something like that, should it occur. In terms of the -- again, I almost hate to use the word deceleration because in almost all cases, our growth ambitions for the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels than, in many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we've had the last year, if not 2 years. And so deceleration, what I would say for many of our verticals, we've assumed lower but still strong growth is the way I would characterize it. Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don't see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to continue to be tougher, let's say, continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we have seen some pressure in communications in Europe in particular. And although we are very pleased with our growth in Financial Services, in banking and capital markets specifically, I would say that is an industry that we are watching, through Richard Lumb's leadership, we are watching very, very carefully and very closely."

Some of the matters we'll discuss in this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. 
During our call today, we reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. 
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre."

Given some travel limitations, I'm not able to be with you in person [ph] this week. So David and I decided to prerecord our remarks, and then he will be available to take your questions at the end of the call. 
Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I am particularly pleased with our durable and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth for 2 years in a row and we have gained significant market share. 
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We generated record revenues of $32.9 billion with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted basis, an 11% increase. Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 10 basis point on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1 billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend. 
So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our business, which clearly reflect the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day. Now let me hand over to David."

We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leade",1544,"Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which once again reinforce our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to being a leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to ""the New"", including digital, cloud and security. By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal '16 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal '15. 
At a high level, our quarter 4 results continued to reflect strong performance across all 3 of our financial imperatives: durable revenue growth faster than the market; sustainable margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people; and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. To be more specific, quarter 4 represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth with continued significant gains in market share. 
Our net revenue growth of just over 9% local currency was broad-based and balanced across most dimensions of our business. Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from quarter 4 of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability, which enabled us to invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter. And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
So we finished the year in a manner which was very consistent with the previous 3 quarters, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash flows. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were $9 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. And outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital-related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4 billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency. 
The trends in revenue growth across our 5 businesses were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined, as well as operations posted another quarter of double-digit growth, while application services delivered very solid growth in the mid-single-digit range. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New,"" led by digital-related services.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of ""the New"" across all of the industries within Products. And our investments over the past few years are serving us very well in meeting the new demands of our clients. H&PS posted another strong quarter with 11% growth, driven by continued double-digit growth in health and overall in North America and the growth markets. Financial Services grew 9% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets as well as positive growth across all 3 geographies, led by double-digit growth in Europe. 
Communications, Media & Technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected continued strong overall growth in North America and the growth markets. In Europe, we did see contraction, driven primarily by communications. Finally, Resources growth was flat in the quarter as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continue to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities, which is benefiting from clients' investments to digitize their businesses. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter 4 last year. 
In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apax Partners, we closed our Duck Creek transaction. This transaction, along with an immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of Navitaire, lowered our quarter 4 tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31 last year. 
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the year with a global headcount of about 384,000 people. Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up 1% from quarter 3 and up 2% from the same period last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. As Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents an 11% -- $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March. 
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of our original business outlook provided last September. I'm extremely pleased that we continued our track record of successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% in local currency for the full year, well above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups, geographies and businesses. We were very pleased with double-digit growth in Products, H&PS and Financial Services as well as overall in both North America and Europe. From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined as well as operations with very good mid-single-digit growth in application services. And of course, across the board, we saw double-digit growth in ""the New,"" estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by digital-related services with estimated growth of approximately 30%. 
Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal '15 adjusted operating margin and within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments in our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity, resulting from improvements in our underlying profitability. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY '15 and was above the upper end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong top line growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1. And finally, we delivered on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions, and returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders. 
So again, following a very strong year in fiscal '15, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders. Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our outstanding performance in fiscal '16 demonstrate that our growth strategy continues to resonate with our clients and that we are clearly executing very well. We are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the last few years to align Accenture along 5 distinct businesses, to transform the services we offer and to increase our investment in new and high-growth areas. This is all that's driving differentiation for Accenture and making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in the new digital world. 
Our 5 businesses, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations, are each highly competitive in their own right as well as synergistic in delivering value for our clients. Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace, from being relevant in the boardroom to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms, to operating services on behalf of clients to drive tangible outcomes. At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer, rotating our business rapidly to what we call ""the New"": digital, cloud and security-related services, which together, accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in 2016. That is a substantial increase from approximately 30% of revenues just a year ago.
Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients on with ""the New."" In digital, we are working with Meliá hotels, the European hospitality company, to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all channels through data-driven customer segmentation. In just 1 year, direct sales are up 27%, and more than 1 million people have enjoyed Meliá Rewards program In cloud, we are helping Río Tinto, a global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the public cloud, including the world's largest SAP production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with an As-a-Service model. And in security, our cyber experts are working with a large U.S.-based utility to define, develop and run a next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to assess risk, manage identity and enable alerts for cyber threats in real time. 
We continue to make significant investments across our business, particularly in acquisitions. In fiscal year '16, we invested more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions. And that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when we look at these last 2 years, I'm delighted that about 70% of our investment in acquisitions have been in ""the New."" In the fourth quarter alone, we announced 5 acquisitions in ""the New,"" including 3 digital services companies: MOBGEN in the Netherlands, Tecnilógica in Spain and dgroup in Germany; and 2 security companies: Maglan in Israel and Redcore in Australia. 
We continue to see strong demand from our clients for large-scale mission-critical transformation programs. The broad range of services we provide across our 5 businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to differentiate Accenture. And we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. For Stryker, the medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We are leveraging the Accenture, SAP Business Solutions Group to build a solution on S/4HANA spanning finance, sales, logistics, supply chain and procurement. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm delighted as we delivered another year of strong and balanced growth around the world with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in both North America and Europe as well as in many of all other countries. In North America, we delivered 11% growth in local currency, driven by the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth for 5 of the last 6 years. In Europe, we grew revenue 11% in local currency with double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, South Africa and Mexico. 
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our business and to create cutting-edge solutions for clients. In today's fast-changing environment where companies need to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive more value for our clients and help them invent the future. Our approach to innovation spans everything we do: from Accenture Research [ph], where we identify market and technology trends; to Accenture Ventures, where we invest in growth-stage companies; to the Accenture Labs, where we incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D; to Accenture Studios, where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility. 
Our unique approach with the Accenture innovation architecture enables us to combine our capabilities across the company to invent, develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients and [indiscernible]. So as we enter fiscal year '17, we have momentum in our business. And you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities for the future in order to deliver strong, durable and profitable growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year '17, and then take your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. David, over to you."

For the first quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal '16 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal '16. 
For the full fiscal '17, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range includes an estimated benefit of less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98 or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal '17, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

As you've heard Pierre and me say several times over the last really couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investment in our business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to also position ourselves for long-term market leadership beyond just the year that we're in. And when you look at the 10 to 30 basis point range, that's a range that we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million. And so when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of investment that we made in the business, and it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be clear, our investments were significantly higher, I'm talking about on the margin, even a little higher than they otherwise would have been, which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points. So it's simply a reflection of the fact that we're managing a large investment pool in the business. And on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let's say, being at the low end or the upper end. But we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We've created significantly more expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund, really, a material level of investments overall. So we are quite pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will."

Well, let me just take a minute and just frame how we see the environment and then how that relates to our guidance. I think, first of all, and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone on this call, in balance, we see the overall macro environment being more volatile, let's say, at this time than where it was a year ago entering fiscal '16. So we see a higher level of volatility overall in the macro environment for the reasons that this group understands very well. Having said that, in that context our guidance assumes that the market growth, and when I reference market growth, I'm talking about the basket of publicly traded companies, we expect for purposes of managing our business and the outlook that the market growth is going to be very similar in '17 to what we saw in '16. And in '16, to be clear, we saw organic growth in the basket of publicly traded companies of about 2.5%. Now just to pause on that point for a minute, that means that in '16, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly 3x the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of the power of our strategy and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we're doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5%, overall growth, let's say, of 4.5% in that range. Now offsetting that, so a higher risk profile in the macro, the market growth as I called out, is the fact that we're starting this year with a high level of confidence. We continue to see strong momentum in our business. And that's a reflection of the things that we have done very uniquely in positioning our business for the market of today and the market that we see in the future. When you look at what we've done organizing around 5 distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as leaders in their own right individually but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly differentiated way, when you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to ""the New,"" meeting those new and emerging needs of our clients, all of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there, all of that continues to come together in a powerful way. And we're very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year. All that translates into 5% to 8% growth. As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of possibilities. We always work hard every day to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be higher than market growth than we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, which would be quite a strong result. So hopefully, that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance."

If you look at our 5 operating groups against the 5% to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have Products, which is the operating group that is positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it's likely that Products would deliver a level of growth that is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture. Now will it be as high as it was in '16? I don't think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very, very strong. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Resources. And Resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy and chemicals and natural resources, I would say no different than what we saw last year. We also continue to expect utilities to be a very strong performer for us. But on balance, when you net that together, we think it's likely that Resources is going to be below that 5% to 8% range, still flat to positive growth but below that range. And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continue to expect strong growth for those 3 operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons the growth will be, let's say, lower than the strong growth that several of those operating groups delivered in '16. Still very healthy growth, mind you, and growth that represents taking share in the case of all 3 of those. But at this point in our guidance, we're not assuming that those 3 operating groups would deliver above the 8%. So when you say what's different, with Products, it's more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year. Resources continues to have the headwinds with the 2 verticals in particular. And then the other 3 operating groups we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might have said 18% for Products, I meant to say 15%. I misspoke on that. So they were 15% for the year."

We have a very strong practice. We have a strong leadership, a great team, broadly. And I think it just speaks again to the differentiation that we have, in this case, in Financial Services Europe, and the extent to which they are really bringing the full power of our strategy to serve our clients, which have a variety of needs. I think as -- if I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in Financial Services that continued to be present in the fourth quarter and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean, the first demand driver -- first of all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, Financial Services is a very technology-intensive sector, especially if you're thinking about banking and capital markets, specifically. Within that, I would say the 3 demand drivers continue to be significant investment in digitizing the customer channels, so what we refer to, the sector refers to as distribution and marketing. There are significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank. Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there's significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let's say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing, really, the enterprise but especially the channel. And then a third driver would be risk and regulatory broadly, where we have market-leading capability, and that serves us very well. So when you look at the fourth quarter, all 3 of those things were at play globally but certainly in Europe. And we think we're well positioned. And we think that banks, in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth. And we are well positioned to help them with that. When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter and we don't see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we, along with everyone else, continue to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years, to come. And so we watch that very closely. We're not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk. And we are working hard to anticipate those, should they occur, and then respond accordingly."

And so in this environment, where we've had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which as I called out, was just under 2%. So to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price continues to appreciate, such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was at the time we granted. And so you can take a point of view on where you think our share price will head, and then that would inform you as to whether or not that would benefit us going forward. On the headcount, was the second part of your question. As you look forward to next year, there is an interesting evolution, if you will, on how we talk about headcount even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on these 5 distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent, strategy and supply/demand model, it's a little bit -- it's more nuanced, if you will, in terms of how we communicate headcount-related data. And so what I would say in general is that we have a history of haring to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively. Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really at industry-leading levels. And so as we look forward, our headcount is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is as good as anyone in our industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that we've provided for on our guidance."

And so when you use the word core, just to level-set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that it is not in the roughly 40% we identify as in ""the New."" So you're talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there, and Pierre has made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with ""the New"" and the 60% that we identify outside of ""the New."" So again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security. So the point is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business. And our goal, just as it is in ""the New,"" is to grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we just completed, we estimate that our core grew, had positive growth, albeit in the single-digit, low single-digit range as by design, the vast majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy. But nonetheless, our core business continued to grow, and we estimate that it grew faster than the market and we took share. And we invest for that growth and we focus on it as a key part of our business. An example of that would be something that again, I think, Pierre has referenced. Bhaskar Ghosh, who leads technology, has talked about this in different forums. But an example of that would be the investment that we've made in our myWizard platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core application services work through the use of an automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents, in the case of this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective. When you look at, for example, some of the investments that we've made in our strategy and consulting business, while strategy and consulting business is focused on ""the New,"" consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our strategy and consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call ""the New."" When you look at the investments that we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives us an industry-leading strategy capability in the retail sector and really strengthens our position there, certainly a part of that investment benefits us in ""the New."" But there's a part of that investment that is the core strategy capability in retail that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So we invest in both parts of the business. And in both cases, our intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share."

But when you think about month 1 of the quarter and when you think about the operating groups and the industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases, not only for the last year but for the last 2 years, right? As confident as we are in many of our industries as we sit here in the first month of the year, to assume that all of those industries and all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary double-digit growth for a third year in a row would just -- probably wouldn't be prudent. Now does that mean that we don't have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners aren't working hard every day to hit the repeat button and do again what they've done the last 2 years? Absolutely not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally. And that's what's reflected in our guidance. And again, that's not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don't. We think it's very good guidance in the context of the market growth, and it's entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster than the market. But if some of these industries have strong but, let's say, lower growth than they've had the last 2 years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range.

But we don't see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%. So in other words, we're not speculating on -- you pick your black swan of the day, we're not speculating on some black swan event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of something like that, should it occur. In terms of the -- again, I almost hate to use the word deceleration because in almost all cases, our growth ambitions for the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels than, in many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we've had the last year, if not 2 years. And so deceleration, what I would say for many of our verticals, we've assumed lower but still strong growth is the way I would characterize it. Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don't see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to continue to be tougher, let's say, continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we have seen some pressure in communications in Europe in particular.

Certainly, a lot of that talent acquisition investment is in each of the markets that we operate in around the world. I would also point out though, that digital is -- I'm sorry, that GDN also supports and is very integral to a big part of ""the New."" And so we are investing in differentiated skills and, obviously, in cloud and in security, in digital in the GDN as well. But again, we will -- we're very comfortable with our ability to acquire talent and to ramp that up as we need to as the market growth evolves throughout the year."

What I can say is that the resiliency -- so let me back up. A key tenet of our strategy, our growth strategy, is to create durability and resiliency in our business. And that is reflected in our focus across 5 businesses. It's focused in our investments to lead in ""the New."" And it's focused in -- and it's rooted in the focused but diverse portfolio that we have across industries and across geographies. And whereas maybe some of our competitors, you can apply this to who you want, are more dependent on 1 or 2 or 3 verticals in 1 or 2 markets, that's not the case with Accenture. And that is, in fact, the differentiator and probably colors our comments and our results versus some of our competitors, all of whom we respect, but yet we think we're differentiated for the reasons that I mentioned. Again, in addition to chemicals and energy and natural resources, we've got our eye on communications in Europe in particular. And while we haven't seen any impact at this point in banking and capital markets, we're not blind to the dynamics of the Brexit and how it could evolve. And Richard Lumb, who is our Group Chief Executive for Financial Services, is very focused on staying on top of that. And we'll see how it plays out. But I would say so far, so good. Okay. So let me just close out the call and thank everyone again for joining us on the call. Hope you found it helpful and insightful. As we enter fiscal '17, we're very pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business. With the differentiated capabilities we're building, our continued rotation to ""the New"" and our disciplined management of the business, we're very confident in our ability to continue gaining market share and driving profitable growth. On behalf of Pierre and our entire leadership team, I want to thank all Accenture people around the world for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our clients and our business and to delivering another excellent year. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out to KC. Thank you."

We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We grew revenues ahead of the market, gaining significant market share, and I am particularly pleased that our growth continues to be broad-based across the dimensions of our business, including very strong double-digit growth in new high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services. 
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.3 billion. We generated revenues of $8.5 billion with 7% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.58, a 23% increase. We expanded operating margin 40 basis points to 15.6%. We generated strong free cash flow of $1 billion, and we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we are off to a strong start in fiscal year '17. I feel very good about our business and the speed at which we are executing our strategy to drive differentiation for Accenture and accelerate our rotation to ""the New."" 
Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you."

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we were very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which came in as expected and represent a positive first step to achieving our full year objectives. 
Our focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace and strengthen our ability to deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders. Once again, we delivered on all 3 of our financial imperatives for driving shareholder value. I'm particularly pleased with the continued progress we're making in expanding our operating margin while investing significantly in our business and our people. Our ongoing focus on our fit-for-purpose agenda is serving us well as we seek to optimize the economics across each of our 5 businesses. 
So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the 3 imperatives. Strong local currency growth of 7% continues to support our strategic objective to grow faster than the market and take share. We delivered positive growth in the majority of our industry groups and geographic markets, with 5 industry groups growing double digits. Strong momentum in ""the New"" continue to be the driver of our growth. 
With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we exceeded operating margin -- we expanded operating margin by 40 basis points while continuing to make significant investments to build scale and differentiation in strategic and high-growth areas of our business. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. As it relates to our capital investments, we invested roughly $600 million primarily attributed to 10 acquisitions, and we're well positioned to invest at least $1 billion to acquire critical capabilities this year especially in ""the New"". 
With that said, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.3 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Our new bookings came in, in the range we expected this quarter and represented 9% growth in local currency. 
This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in the first quarter which then build throughout the year. We're very pleased with our estimated bookings in strategy and consulting services combined, and of course, digital cloud and security-related services continue to be an important theme in the work we're contracting with our clients. Looking forward, we feel good about our pipeline, and we expect to deliver strong bookings in quarter 2. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 7% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1% compared to the flat impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the actual FX impact, we were at the upper end of our guided range for the quarter.  Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 7% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our 5 business dimensions. Growth was led by operations, which posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined as well as application services delivered mid-single-digit growth. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New"" with all 3 components, digital, cloud and security, growing double digit as well. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products, our largest operating group, led with 17% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of digital, cloud and security-based solutions across all Products industries. 
Financial Services grew 6% in the quarter, with overall positive growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, primarily driven by very strong growth in Europe. We did see contraction in banking and capital markets in North America but expect to return to positive growth during this fiscal year. H&PS came in as expected at 5% growth, with balanced growth across Health & Public Services globally and strong double-digit growth in the growth markets. 
Communications, Media & Technology grew 4% and reflected strong overall growth in both North America and the growth markets. We saw strong double-digit growth in media and entertainment and solid growth in electronics and high-tech. We continued to see contraction in Europe, driven primarily by communications. 
Finally, Resources revenues decreased 2% in the quarter, driven by continued challenging market conditions in both energy and chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. The bright spot continues to be utilities, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter but not at the level required to offset the pressure in the other 2 industries. We expect our Resources operating group to continue to navigate a challenging environment throughout this fiscal year but remain very focused on delivering flat to slightly positive growth for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 32% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared with 10.9% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 5.8% for the same period -- the same quarter last year. 
Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.3% for the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. 
Net income was $1.1 billion for the first quarter compared with net income of $869 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with EPS of $1.28 in the first quarter last year, and this reflects a 23% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 44 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 41 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $85 million. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5 million shares for $588 million at an average price of $116.44 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share for a total of $785 million. This represented an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our quarter 1 results, and we're off to a good start in fiscal '17. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our very strong first quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute a strategy that is resonating very well with our clients and driving differentiation for Accenture in the marketplace. We continue to make significant investments to rotate our business to ""the New,"" digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for more than 40% of our total revenues and, again this quarter, grew at a very strong double-digit rate. 
The need to go digital continues to drive strong demand from our clients around the world. We are working with ENGIE, the multinational utility, to transform its retail business model by completely rethinking the customer experience. We are leveraging the service design and innovation of Fjord, part of Accenture Interactive, to help ENGIE create new services to disrupt the market. With Hess, the global energy company, we are implementing a cloud-based As-a-Service operating model. With our cloud solutions and predictive analytics, Hess is able to increase efficiency and improve maintenance across its asset base while benefiting from consumption-based pricing. And we are working with one of Europe's largest home improvement retailers to create and implement a new multichannel strategy to accelerate digital transformation. Our retail experts at Javelin, part of Accenture Strategy, and our designers at Fjord are helping shape and deliver a more personalized customer experience. 
We continue to invest across the business to accelerate our rotation to ""the New,"" both organically and through acquisition. And in the first quarter, we deployed $600 million in strategic acquisition. In digital, we are acquiring OCTO Technology, a leading digital consulting firm based in Paris. We also acquired Karmarama , a creative agency in the U.K.; and Allen International, a design consultancy that specializes in banking. 
In cloud, we acquired DayNine, a leading Workday consulting and services provider; and Nashco Consulting, which expands our capabilities in ServiceNow. In security, we acquired Defense Point Security, enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities for U.S. federal agencies, and we completed the acquisition of Redcore in Australia. We also further strengthen the capabilities of Accenture Strategy with the acquisition of Kurt Salmon, which brings deep expertise in the retail industry. 
At the same time, we continue to leverage our unique position in the technology ecosystem. Our clients value our independence as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players. 
With Google, we formed a new alliance to create industry-specific cloud and mobile solutions to help clients advance their digital transformation agenda and improve business performance. We expanded our Salesforce capabilities to include new platform for Financial Services, consumer goods and life sciences companies, and we now have significantly more people skilled in Salesforce than any other provider. 
We are always looking ahead to anticipate what's next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation-led approach to help our clients invent the future. A key element is Accenture Ventures, which includes a robust open-innovation program that works with start-ups, accelerators and entrepreneurs, and we recently formed a strategic relationship with Partech Ventures, a leading venture capital firm to help clients tap into the rich pool of innovation from start-ups in Europe and Silicon Valley. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to grow ahead of the market in each of our geographic regions. In North America, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in several key industries, including consumer goods, retail and travel services, life sciences and media and entertainment. 
In Europe, we had another strong quarter with 7% growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in several of our major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And in growth markets, we were very pleased with our 10% growth in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Japan and China. 
In closing, our rotation to ""the New"" is clearly at the heart of our strategy to position Accenture for future growth. The strong capabilities we are building are not only recognized by our clients but also by many prominent industry analysts, and I'm very proud of the recognition we have received for the relevance and depth of our services, ranging from the strength of our overall position in digital services to our specific expertise in analytics, cloud and digital experience, to our leadership in emerging technologies like intelligent automation, Internet of Things and blockchain. So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with our results and especially with the balance we are striking between delivering results today while continuing to invest to drive future growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you again."

For the second quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.4 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '16, and this range reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal '16. For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect our net revenue to be in a range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share, adjusting for the updated FX assumption, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.87 or 6% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, let me start, Tien-tsin, with the fact that when we provide guidance, we provide it because we expect we're going to land in that range. And as pleased as we've been in the past where we've exceeded the range, that hasn't been our intent. We don't set guidance with the expectation that we're going to beat it. So having said that, in that context, again, we're very pleased with 7% growth. And there's really 2 reasons under -- I would say, 3 reasons underneath that. One is, is that, that growth does reflect, we believe, significantly higher growth in the market. And when you look at what that means in dollar terms, when you look at the dollar share gains that we've taken underneath that 7% growth, it's tremendous. The second reason we're pleased with the 7% growth is because when you peel underneath the 5 operating groups and look at it across the 13 industries and the 20-some-odd geographic markets that we operate around -- in around the world, the vast majority of those had positive growth and, in many cases, double-digit growth. So if you look at our 13 industries, 5 of the 13 had double-digit growth. And of course, the third reason we're pleased with the growth is because of the continued very strong growth in ""the New."" And so we feel very good about the growth, to be clear. We did signal previously that we had some areas in our business that were more challenged. We've talked about chemicals and natural resources and energy for some time now, and I would say that quarter 1, for the most part, was more of the same, maybe a little bit more pressured in North America in the first quarter. We signaled last quarter that we had a period of lower growth that we were going to be going through in communications Europe, and that played out as expected. And then I did mention banking and capital markets in North America, which is more attributed to a revenue pattern on a few large clients in the quarter, with the expectation that we'll return to positive growth. But even in banking and capital markets, if you look globally, we had very good growth. And in Europe, in banking and capital markets, we had double-digit growth. So our guidance assumed that growth rates in many of of our -- areas of our business would be lower, and that's what's played out. Sorry for that long answer. But Pierre, I'll see if you want to add anything."

If you look at Products specifically, they are doing quite well, both in terms of the top line growth and the profitability. There is no doubt about it. When you look at their expansion in margin, I think, at a high level, I think that's a reflection of 2 things Number one is, I think, it's a really good illustration of the power of executing the strategy. So what you see in Products is a high level of rotation to ""the New."" You see a strong component of consulting and strategy services combined, so very much operating kind of at the heart of the industry and the client agenda. And I think what you see in their profitability is a reflection of that. It's the power of being able to really bring, to the fullest extent, our business architecture around 5 businesses rotating in ""the New"" with very, very deep industry expertise. That's what's at play there. As part of that, they also are more efficient just as a tactical point in sales and marketing call So overall, we're pleased with our profitability. We're pleased with our contract profitability. We're pleased with our payroll cost structure overall.

What we believe is, on one hand, it's still certainly early days of this digital transformation. Now as you're saying, we're starting to see some more maturity in the way our clients are buying our services. So we have moved from the very early days of small project or prototype proof of concepts, testing the water with digital to try to understand what are the new business models. I think this wave, at least for the B2C, for the B2C, is behind us -- for the business to consumer, sorry, is behind us. And now the business to consumer digital-related services are maturing more rapidly, driving bigger transformation projects. Now if you move to more the B2B related to Internet of Things or industrial Internet, we're still in wave 1, where, indeed, we're working more around prototyping the future, finding user cases for the smart glasses, for the analytics and for the drones and all of the like. And so the maturity probably will come in the next 12 months. So I still see a bit of a difference between the B2C and the B2B. And accordingly, if you look at Accenture, we have been scaling to leadership our services from a B2C standpoint. I'm thinking, of course, about the great success of Accenture Interactive, where now we are in a leading position. I'm thinking as well of all what we are developing in eCommerce kind of services or analytics supporting as well the business to consumer. And at the same time, we are investing and scaling our services more on the B2B, especially around the Internet of Things, the industrial Internet and other type of services that's tied to artificial intelligence as well."

No doubt that we continue to see that shift in the budget of our clients. Interestingly, the overall budget, including digital, is probably increasing more than decreasing because you have the budget coming from -- for instance, digital advertising and digital marketing now are becoming part of the addressable market for a company like us. So our rotation to digital cloud and security has opened new opportunities for us, and it's confirmed by the industry analysts, who are all mentioning the shift from legacy technology to digital-related services.

Second, more and more providing that business As-a-Service, which is, of course, contributing to support the agenda of our clients where they move -- they want to move from fixed to variable and CapEx to OpEx. Three, it's going beyond managing operations that is bringing analytics, cloud services, amazing richness in what they do, and I truly believe, a tribute to the team, that they've been reinventing the kind of services, and that is why we're growing 10%, which is much more than the BPO business and gaining significant market share.

I will say that, as I said last quarter I believe, is that the ultimate impact depends on what happens to the stock prices the way the accounting works. And so if the stock price appreciates between when a grant is issued and -- versus when it's awarded, then that creates a tax benefit. If the stock price goes down between the issuance and the date that it's awarded, while the year award date and the date you get the share, then it would create a tax headwind or it would have a negative impact tax rate. And so to be clear, it will depend in the future on what happens to the stock price, and you're looking at the difference between when it was granted and when they actually get -- it's vested and make it the award."

And this is one example of the power of the focus that we have on increasingly managing each of these businesses and optimizing the economics for each business individually. And that includes optimizing sales and marketing costs for each of the businesses individually, recognizing that the way you approach sales and marketing in a strategy practice is fundamentally different than the way you do it in an operations practice. And so we continue to focus on optimization across all of our business activities and our entire cost structure, of which sales and marketing is a key component of that. So we'll see how it goes.

So they're all very similar in the nature of the business and what we've been doing for many years. Now it's the nature of the services, which are, of course, different because they are in digital or software in the cloud. Now software in the cloud, at the end of the day, is an application package you have to implement, and we know how to do that. So I don't believe that the shift in our rotation to ""the New"" is challenging the visibility on the business or is changing the fundamentals of our business. Now fundamentally changing the nature of the services we are providing in digital marketing, in cloud, in security services and so forth, but I don't think it is changing the visibility or it has a profound impact on the business model."

And of course, the digital has been a driving force on these consulting growth. But when you look at it, you still have the same continuum with clients. It's starting with strategy and here, more digital strategy than corporate strategies from the past. Then you need to create operating models, digital operating model for clients, and you need to understand very well the industry drivers and disruptions to all what we're calling the Accenture Consulting. Then you build solution, and this is the job of Accenture Digital and Accenture Technology. And then you operate on behalf of the business if clients want to do that. And at the end of the day, that's why we built this business architecture from strategy to building solution to operate on behalf of clients. And we are the only one in the marketplace to have this continuum of services because this is what we believe the clients' going to buy moving forward. And there are always going to be a role for the outsourcing. Because again, you envision the business. You build solutions and you operate solutions, and we want to be a leading company in these 3 activities, if you will. And if you look at digital, indeed, it's starting more with a strategy and the consulting piece of the business, but there are already many activities we have from an outsourcing standpoint coming in my mind would be cloud, where we're managing cloud services on behalf of clients; would be cybersecurity, where a significant part of our cybersecurity services are managed services; and three, I'm thinking about the analytics. We are more and more as well driving on behalf of the clients, including some marketing campaigns. So again you need to look at it as a continuum of services we are providing to clients. So we're there for whatever they want to execute."

So you asked that question, Pierre and I were talking about this just recently just as we analyzed our business.

So when you look at 85% of our business, it's really very consistent pattern with what we've seen now for many quarters. We have these few concentrated areas where the market dynamics are such that it has created some challenges in the quarter that we just closed. And in some cases, to be fair, and we called it out and pointed to some of those challenges, will extend into future quarters this fiscal year. But I think the point of that, and it gets back to the statement that as to why we're so pleased with our business is that the vast majority of our business is really doing quite well and continuing to grow and expand consistent with what we've seen for many quarters."

We -- again we are very pleased with our consulting bookings in the quarter, and that goes across strategy and consulting combined and the app development part of services, and typically bookings lead to revenue growth. So hopefully, that clarified, but bottom line is from a business standpoint, we see a lot of demand drivers, including back to digital and ""the New"" as Pierre has alluded to a couple of times that really serve us well in our strategy and consulting business, and so it's a very active marketplace at this point in time."

We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We grew revenues ahead of the market, gaining significant market share, and I am particularly pleased that our growth continues to be broad-based across the dimensions of our business, including very strong double-digit growth in new high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services. 
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.3 billion. We generated revenues of $8.5 billion with 7% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.58, a 23% increase. We expanded operating margin 40 basis points to 15.6%. We generated strong free cash flow of $1 billion, and we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we are off to a strong start in fiscal year '17. I feel very good about our business and the speed at which we are executing our strategy to drive differentiation for Accenture and accelerate our rotation to ""the New.""

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we were very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which came in as expected and represent a positive first step to achieving our full year objectives. 
Our focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace and strengthen our ability to deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders. Once again, we delivered on all 3 of our financial imperatives for driving shareholder value. I'm particularly pleased with the continued progress we're making in expanding our operating margin while investing significantly in our business and our people. Our ongoing focus on our fit-for-purpose agenda is serving us well as we seek to optimize the economics across each of our 5 businesses. 
So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the 3 imperatives. Strong local currency growth of 7% continues to support our strategic objective to grow faster than the market and take share. We delivered positive growth in the majority of our industry groups and geographic markets, with 5 industry groups growing double digits. Strong momentum in ""the New"" continue to be the driver of our growth. 
With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we exceeded operating margin -- we expanded operating margin by 40 basis points while continuing to make significant investments to build scale and differentiation in strategic and high-growth areas of our business. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. As it relates to our capital investments, we invested roughly $600 million primarily attributed to 10 acquisitions, and we're well positioned to invest at least $1 billion to acquire critical capabilities this year especially in ""the New"". 
With that said, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.3 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Our new bookings came in, in the range we expected this quarter and represented 9% growth in local currency. 
This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in the first quarter which then build throughout the year. We're very pleased with our estimated bookings in strategy and consulting services combined, and of course, digital cloud and security-related services continue to be an important theme in the work we're contracting with our clients. Looking forward, we feel good about our pipeline, and we expect to deliver strong bookings in quarter 2. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 7% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1% compared to the flat impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the actual FX impact, we were at the upper end of our guided range for the quarter.  Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 7% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our 5 business dimensions. Growth was led by operations, which posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined as well as application services delivered mid-single-digit growth. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New"" with all 3 components, digital, cloud and security, growing double digit as well. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products, our largest operating group, led with 17% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of digital, cloud and security-based solutions across all Products industries. 
Financial Services grew 6% in the quarter, with overall positive growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, primarily driven by very strong growth in Europe. We did see contraction in banking and capital markets in North America but expect to return to positive growth during this fiscal year. H&PS came in as expected at 5% growth, with balanced growth across Health & Public Services globally and strong double-digit growth in the growth markets. 
Communications, Media & Technology grew 4% and reflected strong overall growth in both North America and the growth markets. We saw strong double-digit growth in media and entertainment and solid growth in electronics and high-tech. We continued to see contraction in Europe, driven primarily by communications. 
Finally, Resources revenues decreased 2% in the quarter, driven by continued challenging market conditions in both energy and chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. The bright spot continues to be utilities, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter but not at the level required to offset the pressure in the other 2 industries. We expect our Resources operating group to continue to navigate a challenging environment throughout this fiscal year but remain very focused on delivering flat to slightly positive growth for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 32% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared with 10.9% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 5.8% for the same period -- the same quarter last year. 
Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.3% for the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. 
Net income was $1.1 billion for the first quarter compared with net income of $869 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with EPS of $1.28 in the first quarter last year, and this reflects a 23% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 44 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 41 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $85 million. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5 million shares for $588 million at an average price of $116.44 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share for a total of $785 million. This represented an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our quarter 1 results, and we're off to a good start in fiscal '17. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

We continue to make significant investments to rotate our business to ""the New,"" digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for more than 40% of our total revenues and, again this quarter, grew at a very strong double-digit rate. 
The need to go digital continues to drive strong demand from our clients around the world. We are working with ENGIE, the multinational utility, to transform its retail business model by completely rethinking the customer experience. We are leveraging the service design and innovation of Fjord, part of Accenture Interactive, to help ENGIE create new services to disrupt the market. With Hess, the global energy company, we are implementing a cloud-based As-a-Service operating model. With our cloud solutions and predictive analytics, Hess is able to increase efficiency and improve maintenance across its asset base while benefiting from consumption-based pricing. And we are working with one of Europe's largest home improvement retailers to create and implement a new multichannel strategy to accelerate digital transformation. Our retail experts at Javelin, part of Accenture Strategy, and our designers at Fjord are helping shape and deliver a more personalized customer experience. 
We continue to invest across the business to accelerate our rotation to ""the New,"" both organically and through acquisition. And in the first quarter, we deployed $600 million in strategic acquisition. In digital, we are acquiring OCTO Technology, a leading digital consulting firm based in Paris. We also acquired Karmarama , a creative agency in the U.K.; and Allen International, a design consultancy that specializes in banking. 
In cloud, we acquired DayNine, a leading Workday consulting and services provider; and Nashco Consulting, which expands our capabilities in ServiceNow. In security, we acquired Defense Point Security, enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities for U.S. federal agencies, and we completed the acquisition of Redcore in Australia. We also further strengthen the capabilities of Accenture Strategy with the acquisition of Kurt Salmon, which brings deep expertise in the retail industry. 
At the same time, we continue to leverage our unique position in the technology ecosystem. Our clients value our independence as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players. 
With Google, we formed a new alliance to create industry-specific cloud and mobile solutions to help clients advance their digital transformation agenda and improve business performance. We expanded our Salesforce capabilities to include new platform for Financial Services, consumer goods and life sciences companies, and we now have significantly more people skilled in Salesforce than any other provider. 
We are always looking ahead to anticipate what's next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation-led approach to help our clients invent the future. A key element is Accenture Ventures, which includes a robust open-innovation program that works with start-ups, accelerators and entrepreneurs, and we recently formed a strategic relationship with Partech Ventures, a leading venture capital firm to help clients tap into the rich pool of innovation from start-ups in Europe and Silicon Valley. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to grow ahead of the market in each of our geographic regions. In North America, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in several key industries, including consumer goods, retail and travel services, life sciences and media and entertainment. 
In Europe, we had another strong quarter with 7% growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in several of our major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And in growth markets, we were very pleased with our 10% growth in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Japan and China. 
In closing, our rotation to ""the New"" is clearly at the heart of our strategy to position Accenture for future growth. The strong capabilities we are building are not only recognized by our clients but also by many prominent industry analysts, and I'm very proud of the recognition we have received for the relevance and depth of our services, ranging from the strength of our overall position in digital services to our specific expertise in analytics, cloud and digital experience, to our leadership in emerging technologies like intelligent automation, Internet of Things and blockchain. So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with our results and especially with the balance we are striking between delivering results today while continuing to invest to drive future growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you again."

For the second quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.4 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '16, and this range reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal '16. For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect our net revenue to be in a range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share, adjusting for the updated FX assumption, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.87 or 6% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, let me start, Tien-tsin, with the fact that when we provide guidance, we provide it because we expect we're going to land in that range. And as pleased as we've been in the past where we've exceeded the range, that hasn't been our intent. We don't set guidance with the expectation that we're going to beat it. So having said that, in that context, again, we're very pleased with 7% growth. And there's really 2 reasons under -- I would say, 3 reasons underneath that. One is, is that, that growth does reflect, we believe, significantly higher growth in the market. And when you look at what that means in dollar terms, when you look at the dollar share gains that we've taken underneath that 7% growth, it's tremendous. The second reason we're pleased with the 7% growth is because when you peel underneath the 5 operating groups and look at it across the 13 industries and the 20-some-odd geographic markets that we operate around -- in around the world, the vast majority of those had positive growth and, in many cases, double-digit growth. So if you look at our 13 industries, 5 of the 13 had double-digit growth. And of course, the third reason we're pleased with the growth is because of the continued very strong growth in ""the New."" And so we feel very good about the growth, to be clear. We did signal previously that we had some areas in our business that were more challenged. We've talked about chemicals and natural resources and energy for some time now, and I would say that quarter 1, for the most part, was more of the same, maybe a little bit more pressured in North America in the first quarter. We signaled last quarter that we had a period of lower growth that we were going to be going through in communications Europe, and that played out as expected. And then I did mention banking and capital markets in North America, which is more attributed to a revenue pattern on a few large clients in the quarter, with the expectation that we'll return to positive growth. But even in banking and capital markets, if you look globally, we had very good growth. And in Europe, in banking and capital markets, we had double-digit growth. So our guidance assumed that growth rates in many of our -- areas of our business would be lower, and that's what's played out. Sorry for that long answer. But Pierre, I'll see if you want to add anything."

So what you see in Products is a high level of rotation to ""the New."" You see a strong component of consulting and strategy services combined, so very much operating kind of at the heart of the industry and the client agenda. And I think what you see in their profitability is a reflection of that. It's the power of being able to really bring, to the fullest extent, our business architecture around 5 businesses rotating in ""the New"" with very, very deep industry expertise. That's what's at play there. As part of that, they also are more efficient just as a tactical point in sales and marketing call So overall, we're pleased with our profitability. We're pleased with our contract profitability. We're pleased with our payroll cost structure overall.

What we believe is, on one hand, it's still certainly early days of this digital transformation. Now as you're saying, we're starting to see some more maturity in the way our clients are buying our services. So we have moved from the very early days of small project or prototype proof of concepts, testing the water with digital to try to understand what are the new business models. I think this wave, at least for the B2C, for the B2C, is behind us -- for the business to consumer, sorry, is behind us. And now the business to consumer digital-related services are maturing more rapidly, driving bigger transformation projects. Now if you move to more the B2B related to Internet of Things or industrial Internet, we're still in wave 1, where, indeed, we're working more around prototyping the future, finding user cases for the smart glasses, for the analytics and for the drones and all of the like. And so the maturity probably will come in the next 12 months. So I still see a bit of a difference between the B2C and the B2B. And accordingly, if you look at Accenture, we have been scaling to leadership our services from a B2C standpoint. I'm thinking, of course, about the great success of Accenture Interactive, where now we are in a leading position. I'm thinking as well of all what we are developing in eCommerce kind of services or analytics supporting as well the business to consumer. And at the same time, we are investing and scaling our services more on the B2B, especially around the Internet of Things, the industrial Internet and other type of services that's tied to artificial intelligence as well."

Because what's done by Debbie and the team is a profound reinvention of the way you're operating that business by bringing now platform-based services at scale, highly efficient and highly intelligent; second, more and more providing that business As-a-Service, which is, of course, contributing to support the agenda of our clients where they move -- they want to move from fixed to variable and CapEx to OpEx. Three, it's going beyond managing operations, but is bringing analytics, cloud services, amazing richness in what they do. And I truly believe, a tribute to the team, that they have been reinventing the kind of services, and that is why we're growing 10%, which is much more than the BPO business, and gaining significant market share.

In '17, we will have elections in France, my country. There's going to be election in Germany and so on and so on. So what it is we're going to achieve is to build a durable business model with at scale and relevant services, which, at the end of the day, should be as much as we could independent of any form of short-term political effect or other effect. And I think this is what we demonstrated this last -- if you look '15 -- fiscal year '15, fiscal year '16, we have been able to grow double digits. Here, we have a very strong 7% in Q1 despite the environment. So the environment is the environment. There is not much we could do.

I will say that -- as I said last quarter, I believe, is that the ultimate impact depends on what happens to the stock prices the way the accounting works. And so if the stock price appreciates between when a grant is issued and -- versus when it's awarded, then that creates a tax benefit. If the stock price goes down between the issuance and the date that it's awarded -- well, the award date and the date that you get the share, then it would create a tax headwind or would have a -- negatively impact tax rate. And so it -- to be clear, it will depend, in the future, on what happens to the stock price, and you're looking at the difference between when it was granted and when they actually get the -- it's vested and they get the award."

And this is one example of the power of the focus that we have on increasingly managing each of these businesses and optimizing the economics for each business individually. And that includes optimizing sales and marketing costs for each of the businesses individually, recognizing that the way you approach sales and marketing in a strategy practice is fundamentally different than the way you do it in an operations practice. And so we continue to focus on optimization across all of our business activities and our entire cost structure, where sales -- of which sales and marketing is a key component of that.

And of course, the digital has been a driving force on this consulting growth. But when you look at it, you still have the same continuum with clients. It's starting with strategy and here, more digital strategy than corporate strategies from the past. Then you need to create operating models -- digital operating model for clients, and you need to understand very well the industry drivers and disruptions, all of which we're calling Accenture Consulting. Then you build solution, and this is the job of Accenture Digital and Accenture Technology. And then you operate on behalf of the business if clients want to do that. And at the end of the day, that's why we've built this business architecture from strategy to building solution to operate on behalf of clients. And we are the only one in the marketplace to have this continuum of services because this is what we believe the client is going to buy moving forward. And there's always going to be a role for the outsourcing because, again, you envision the business, you build solutions and you operate solutions. And we want to be a leading company in these 3 activities, if you will. And if you look at digital, indeed, it's starting more with a strategy and the consulting piece of the business, but there are already many activities we have from an outsourcing standpoint, coming in my mind would be cloud, where we're managing cloud services on behalf of clients; would be cybersecurity, where a significant part of our cybersecurity services are managed services; and three, I'm thinking about the analytics. We are more and more as well driving on behalf of the clients, including some marketing campaigns.

We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We grew revenues ahead of the market, gaining significant market share, and I am particularly pleased that our growth continues to be broad-based across the dimensions of our business, including very strong double-digit growth in new high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services. 
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.3 billion. We generated revenues of $8.5 billion with 7% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.58, a 23% increase. We expanded operating margin 40 basis points to 15.6%. We generated strong free cash flow of $1 billion, and we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we are off to a strong start in fiscal year '17. I feel very good about our business and the speed at which we are executing our strategy to drive differentiation for Accenture and accelerate our rotation to ""the New."" 
Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you."

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we were very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which came in as expected and represent a positive first step to achieving our full year objectives. 
Our focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace and strengthen our ability to deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders. Once again, we delivered on all 3 of our financial imperatives through driving shareholder value. I'm particularly pleased with the continued progress we're making in expanding our operating margin while investing significantly in our business and our people. Our ongoing focus on our fit-for-purpose agenda is serving us well as we seek to optimize the economics across each of our 5 businesses. 
So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the 3 imperatives. Strong local currency growth of 7% continues to support our strategic objective to grow faster than the market and take share. We delivered positive growth in the majority of our industry groups and geographic markets, with 5 industry groups growing double digits. Strong momentum in ""the New"" continued to be the driver of our growth. 
With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we exceeded operating margin -- we expanded operating margin by 40 basis points while continuing to make significant investments to build scale and differentiation in strategic and high-growth areas of our business. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. As it relates to our capital investments, we invested roughly $600 million, primarily attributed to 10 acquisitions, and we're well positioned to invest at least $1 billion to acquire critical capabilities this year, especially in ""the New"". 
With that said, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.3 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Our new bookings came in, in the range we expected this quarter and represented 9% growth in local currency. 
This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in the first quarter which then build throughout the year. We're very pleased with our estimated bookings in strategy and consulting services combined, and of course, digital, cloud and security-related services continue to be an important theme in the work we're contracting with our clients. Looking forward, we feel good about our pipeline, and we expect to deliver strong bookings in quarter 2. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 7% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1% compared to the flat impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the actual FX impact, we were at the upper end of our guided range for the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 7% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our 5 business dimensions. Growth was led by Operations, which posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined as well as application services delivered mid-single-digit growth. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New"" with all 3 components, digital, cloud and security, growing double digit as well. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products, our largest operating group, led with 17% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of digital, cloud and security-based solutions across all Products industries. 
Financial Services grew 6% in the quarter, with overall positive growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, primarily driven by very strong growth in Europe. We did see contraction in banking and capital markets in North America but expect to return to positive growth during this fiscal year. H&PS came in as expected at 5% growth, with balanced growth across Health & Public Services globally and strong double-digit growth in the growth markets. 
Communications, Media & Technology grew 4% and reflected strong overall growth in both North America and the growth markets. We saw strong double-digit growth in media and entertainment and solid growth in electronics and high-tech. We continued to see contraction in Europe, driven primarily by communications. 
Finally, Resources revenues decreased 2% in the quarter, driven by continued challenging market conditions in both energy and chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. The bright spot continues to be utilities, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter but not at the level required to offset the pressure in the other 2 industries. We expect our Resources operating group to continue to navigate a challenging environment throughout this fiscal year but remain very focused on delivering flat to slightly positive growth for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 32% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared with 10.9% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 5.8% for the same period -- the same quarter last year. 
Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.3% for the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. 
Net income was $1.1 billion for the first quarter compared with net income of $869 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with EPS of $1.28 in the first quarter last year, and this reflects a 23% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 44 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 41 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $85 million. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5 million shares for $588 million at an average price of $116.44 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share for a total of $785 million. This represented an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our quarter 1 results, and we're off to a good start in fiscal '17. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our very strong first quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute a strategy that is resonating very well with our clients and driving differentiation for Accenture in the marketplace. We continue to make significant investments to rotate our business to ""the New,"" digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for more than 40% of our total revenues and again this quarter grew at a very strong double-digit rate. 
The need to go digital continues to drive strong demand from our clients around the world. We are working with ENGIE, the multinational utility, to transform its retail business model by completely rethinking the customer experience. We are leveraging the service design and innovation of Fjord, part of Accenture Interactive, to help ENGIE create new services to disrupt the market. With Hess, the global energy company, we are implementing a cloud-based As-a-Service operating model. With our cloud solutions and predictive analytics, Hess is able to increase efficiency and improve maintenance across its asset base while benefiting from consumption-based pricing. And we're working with one of Europe's largest home improvement retailers to create and implement a new multichannel strategy to accelerate digital transformation. Our retail experts at Javelin, part of Accenture Strategy, and our designers at Fjord are helping shape and deliver a more personalized customer experience. 
We continue to invest across the business to accelerate our rotation to ""the New,"" both organically and through acquisition. And in the first quarter, we deployed $600 million in strategic acquisition. In digital, we are acquiring OCTO Technology, a leading digital consulting firm based in Paris. We also acquired Karmarama, a creative agency in the U.K.; and Allen International, a design consultancy that specializes in banking. 
In cloud, we acquired DayNine, a leading Workday consulting and services provider; and Nashco Consulting, which expands our capabilities in ServiceNow. In security, we acquired Defense Point Security, enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities for U.S. federal agencies, and we completed the acquisition of Redcore in Australia. We also further strengthened the capabilities of Accenture Strategy with the acquisition of Kurt Salmon, which brings deep expertise in the retail industry. 
At the same time, we continued to leverage our unique position in the technology ecosystem. Our clients value our independence as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players. 
With Google, we formed a new alliance to create industry-specific cloud and mobile solutions to help clients advance their digital transformation agendas and improve business performance. We expanded our Salesforce capabilities to include new platforms for Financial Services, consumer goods and life sciences companies, and we now have significantly more people skilled in Salesforce than any other provider. 
We are always looking ahead to anticipate what's next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation-led approach to help our clients invent the future. A key element is Accenture Ventures, which includes a robust open-innovation program that works with start-ups, accelerators and entrepreneurs, and we recently formed a strategic relationship with Partech Ventures, a leading venture capital firm to help clients tap into the rich pool of innovation from start-ups in Europe and Silicon Valley. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to grow ahead of the market in each of our geographic regions. In North America, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in several key industries, including consumer goods, retail and travel services, life sciences and media and entertainment. 
In Europe, we had another strong quarter with 7% growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in several of our major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And in growth markets, we were very pleased with our 10% growth in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Japan and China. 
In closing, our rotation to ""the New"" is clearly at the heart of our strategy to position Accenture for future growth. The strong capabilities we are building are not only recognized by our clients but also by many prominent industry analysts, and I'm very proud of the recognition we have received for the relevance and depth of our services, ranging from the strength of our overall position in digital services to our specific expertise in analytics, cloud and digital experience, to our leadership in emerging technologies like intelligent automation, Internet of Things and blockchain. So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with our results and especially with the balance we are striking between delivering results today while continuing to invest to drive future growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you again."

For the second quarter of fiscal '17, we expect revenues to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.4 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '16, and this range reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '17, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal '16. For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect our net revenue to be in a range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '16. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share, adjusting for the updated FX assumption, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.87 or 6% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I mean, let me start, Tien-tsin, with the fact that when we provide guidance, we provide it because we expect we're going to land in that range. And as pleased as we've been in the past where we've exceeded the range, that hasn't been our intent. We don't set guidance with the expectation that we're going to beat it. So having said that, in that context, again, we're very pleased with 7% growth. And there's really 2 reasons under -- I would say 3 reasons underneath that. One is, is that, that growth does reflect, we believe, significantly higher growth in the market. And when you look at what that means in dollar terms, when you look at the dollar share gains that we've taken underneath that 7% growth, it's tremendous. The second reason we're pleased with the 7% growth is because when you peel underneath the 5 operating groups and look at it across the 13 industries and the 20-some-odd geographic markets that we operate around -- in around the world, the vast majority of those had positive growth and, in many cases, double-digit growth. So if you look at our 13 industries, 5 of the 13 had double-digit growth. And of course, the third reason we're pleased with the growth is because of the continued very strong growth in ""the New."" And so we feel very good about the growth, to be clear. We did signal previously that we had some areas in our business that were more challenged. We've talked about chemicals and natural resources and energy for some time now, and I would say that quarter 1, for the most part, was more of the same, maybe a little bit more pressure in North America in the first quarter. We signaled last quarter that we had a period of lower growth that we were going to be going through in Communications Europe, and that played out as expected. And then I did mention banking and capital markets in North America, which is more attributed to a revenue pattern on a few large clients in the quarter, with the expectation that we'll return to positive growth. But even in banking and capital markets, if you look globally, we had very good growth. And in Europe, in banking and capital markets, we had double-digit growth. So our guidance assumed that growth rates in many of our -- areas of our business would be lower, and that's what's played out. Sorry for that long answer. But Pierre, I'll see if you want to add anything."

When you look at their expansion in margin, I think, at a high level, I think that's a reflection of 2 things. Number one is I think it's a really good illustration of the power of executing the strategy. So what you see in Products is a high level of rotation to ""the New."" You see a strong component of consulting and strategy services combined, so very much operating kind of at the heart of the industry and the client agenda. And I think what you see in their profitability is a reflection of that. It's the power of being able to really bring, to the fullest extent, our business architecture around 5 businesses rotating in ""the New"" with very, very deep industry expertise. That's what's at play there. As part of that, they also are more efficient just as a tactical point in sales and marketing calls. So overall, we were pleased with our profitability. We were pleased with our contract profitability. We were pleased with our payroll cost structure overall.

What we believe is, on one hand, it's still certainly early days of this digital transformation. Now as you're saying, we're starting to see some more maturity in the way our clients are buying our services. So we have moved from the very early days of small project or prototype proof of concept, testing the water with digital to try to understand what are the new business models. I think this wave, at least for the B2C, for the B2C, is behind us -- for the business to consumer, sorry, is behind us. And now the business to consumer digital-related services are maturing more rapidly, driving bigger transformation projects. Now if you move to more the B2B related to Internet of Things or industrial Internet, we're still in wave 1, where, indeed, we're working more around prototyping the future, finding user cases for the smart glasses, for the analytics and for the drones and all of the like. And so the maturity probably will come in the next 12 months. So I still see a bit of a difference between the B2C and the B2B. And accordingly, if you look at Accenture, we have been scaling to leadership our services from a B2C standpoint. And I'm thinking, of course, about the great success of Accenture Interactive, where now we are in a leading position. I'm thinking as well of all what we are developing in eCommerce kind of services or analytics supporting as well the business to consumer. And at the same time, we are investing and scaling our services more on the B2B, especially around the Internet of Things, the industrial Internet and other type of services such as artificial intelligence as well."

No doubt that we continue to see that shift in the budget of our clients. Interestingly, the overall budget, including digital, is probably increasing more than decreasing because you have the budget coming from -- for instance, digital advertising and digital marketing now are becoming part of the addressable market for a company like us. So our rotation to digital, cloud and security has opened new opportunities for us, and it's confirmed by the industry analysts, who are all mentioning the shift from legacy technology to digital-related services. For the rest, I guess, as mentioned by David, we're pleased with our pipeline. We have good prospects for the second quarter bookings.

Second, more and more providing that business As-a-Service, which is, of course, contributing to support the agenda of our clients where they move -- they want to move from fixed to variable and CapEx to OpEx. Three, it's going beyond managing Operations, that is bringing analytics, cloud services, amazing richness in what they do. And I truly believe, a tribute to the team, that they have been reinventing the kind of services, and that is why we're growing 10%, which is much more than the BPO business, and gaining significant market share. I mean, the line is always the same. The appetite from clients is for new technologies, new services, new ways of operating the business, and this is all the rotation we are engaged in at Accenture these last 3 years.

And I think this is what we demonstrated this last -- if you look '15 -- fiscal year '15, fiscal year '16, we have been able to grow double digits. Here, we have a very strong 7% in Q1 despite the environment. So the environment is the environment. There is not much we could do.

I will say that -- as I said last quarter, I believe, is that the ultimate impact depends on what happens to the stock prices the way the accounting works. And so if the stock price appreciates between when a grant is issued and -- versus when it's awarded, then that creates a tax benefit. If the stock price goes down between the issuance and the date that it's awarded -- well, the award date and the date that you get the share, then it would create a tax headwind or would have a -- negatively impact tax rate. And so it -- to be clear, it will depend, in the future, on what happens to the stock price, and you're looking at the difference between when it was granted and when they actually get the -- it's vested and they get the award."

And this is one example of the power of the focus that we have on increasingly managing each of these businesses and optimizing the economics for each business individually. And that includes optimizing sales and marketing costs for each of the businesses individually, recognizing that the way you approach sales and marketing in a strategy practice is fundamentally different than the way you do it in an operations practice. And so we continue to focus on optimization across all of our business activities and our entire cost structure, where sales -- of which sales and marketing is a key component of that.

Then you build solutions, and this is the job of Accenture Digital and Accenture Technology. And then you operate on behalf of the business if clients want to do that. And at the end of the day, that's why we build this business architecture from strategy to building solutions to operate on behalf of clients. And we are the only one in the marketplace to have this continuum of services because this is what we believe the client is going to buy moving forward.

Pierre and I were talking about this just recently just as we analyzed our business. If you look at the few areas where there are some market dynamics that are creating pressure on our business, the areas you called out, that represents less than 15% of our revenue. 85% of our business -- and I don't mind putting this out in traffic, so to speak, the remaining 85% of our business is growing double digit, is growing double digit. So when you look at 85% of our business, it's really a very consistent pattern with what we've seen now for many quarters. We have these few concentrated areas where the market dynamics are such that it has created some challenges in the quarter that we just closed. And in some cases, to be fair, and we've called it out and pointed to some of those challenges will extend into future quarters this fiscal year. But I think the point of that, and it gets back to the statement that -- as to why we're so pleased with our business is that the vast majority of our business is really doing quite well and continuing to grow and expand consistent with what we've seen for many quarters."

What I think is different with the digital transformation of the industry, is the way we look at it, is -- and I don't want to be too emphatic, but this being disrupted and being put out of the business is clearly in the mind of all CEOs on the planet, including the U.S. There is a very strong feeling and understanding that if you're not changing your business models, if you're not surfing this revolution of ""the New"", if you're not adopting fundamentally a new way of operating digitally enabled, you can be put out of the business. And I think this force of ""I could disappear if I'm not really changing now,"" and you have all the facts behind this, this driving force for me is -- or these driving forces are more significant than any presidential election. When you fear about your future as a company, when you fear you can be put out of the business, I don't think you're going to stop your transformation because there is an election.

When you look at Strategy and Consulting combined, and now I'm talking about the businesses -- 2 of the 5 businesses, that grew mid-single digits in the first quarter, which was right in the range we had expected. On the last quarter's call, I believe I stated that the growth for consulting and -- strategy and consulting combined for the year would be mid to high single digits, and so we're pretty much in that range. We -- again, we are very pleased with our consulting bookings in the quarter, and that goes across strategy and consulting combined and the app development part of app services, and typically, bookings lead to revenue growth. So hopefully, that clarified. But the bottom line is, from a business standpoint, we see a lot of demand drivers, including back to digital and ""the New,"" as Pierre has alluded to a couple of times, that really serve us well in our strategy and consulting business, and so it's a very active marketplace at this point in time."

We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We grew revenues ahead of the market, gaining significant market share, and I am particularly pleased that our growth continues to be broad-based across the dimensions of our business, including very strong double-digit growth in new high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services. 
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.3 billion. We generated revenues of $8.5 billion with 7% growth in local currency. We delivered very strong earnings per share of $1.58, a 23% increase. We expanded operating margin 40 basis points to 15.6%. We generated strong free cash flow of $1 billion, and we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
So we are off to a strong start in fiscal year '17. I feel very good about our business and the speed at which we are executing our strategy to drive differentiation for Accenture and accelerate our rotation to ""the New."" 
Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you."

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we were very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which came in as expected and represent a positive first step to achieving our full year objectives. 
Our focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace and strengthen our ability to deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders. Once again, we delivered on all 3 of our financial imperatives through driving shareholder value. I'm particularly pleased with the continued progress we're making in expanding our operating margin while investing significantly in our business and our people. Our ongoing focus on our fit-for-purpose agenda is serving us well as we seek to optimize the economics across each of our 5 businesses. 
So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the 3 imperatives. Strong local currency growth of 7% continues to support our strategic objective to grow faster than the market and take share. We delivered positive growth in the majority of our industry groups and geographic markets, with 5 industry groups growing double digits. Strong momentum in ""the New"" continued to be the driver of our growth. 
With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we exceeded operating margin -- we expanded operating margin by 40 basis points while continuing to make significant investments to build scale and differentiation in strategic and high-growth areas of our business. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which supported our ongoing objective of investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. As it relates to our capital investments, we invested roughly $600 million, primarily attributed to 10 acquisitions, and we're well positioned to invest at least $1 billion to acquire critical capabilities this year, especially in ""the New"". 
With that said, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.3 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $3.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. Our new bookings came in, in the range we expected this quarter and represented 9% growth in local currency. 
This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in the first quarter which then build throughout the year. We're very pleased with our estimated bookings in strategy and consulting services combined, and of course, digital, cloud and security-related services continue to be an important theme in the work we're contracting with our clients. Looking forward, we feel good about our pipeline, and we expect to deliver strong bookings in quarter 2. 
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 7% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1% compared to the flat impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the actual FX impact, we were at the upper end of our guided range for the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency. Our outsourcing revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 7% in local currency. 
Looking broadly at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our 5 business dimensions. Growth was led by Operations, which posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Strategy and consulting services combined as well as application services delivered mid-single-digit growth. And across those 4 businesses, we saw strong double-digit growth in ""the New"" with all 3 components, digital, cloud and security, growing double digit as well. 
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products, our largest operating group, led with 17% growth, reflecting continued double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption of digital, cloud and security-based solutions across all Products industries. 
Financial Services grew 6% in the quarter, with overall positive growth in both insurance and banking and capital markets, primarily driven by very strong growth in Europe. We did see contraction in banking and capital markets in North America but expect to return to positive growth during this fiscal year. H&PS came in as expected at 5% growth, with balanced growth across Health & Public Services globally and strong double-digit growth in the growth markets. 
Communications, Media & Technology grew 4% and reflected strong overall growth in both North America and the growth markets. We saw strong double-digit growth in media and entertainment and solid growth in electronics and high-tech. We continued to see contraction in Europe, driven primarily by communications. 
Finally, Resources revenues decreased 2% in the quarter, driven by continued challenging market conditions in both energy and chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. The bright spot continues to be utilities, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter but not at the level required to offset the pressure in the other 2 industries. We expect our Resources operating group to continue to navigate a challenging environment throughout this fiscal year but remain very focused on delivering flat to slightly positive growth for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared to 32% in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4% compared with 10.9% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 5.8% for the same period -- the same quarter last year. 
Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with quarter 1 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 29.3% for the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to higher benefits from adjustments to prior year taxes as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. 
Net income was $1.1 billion for the first quarter compared with net income of $869 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.58 compared with EPS of $1.28 in the first quarter last year, and this reflects a 23% year-over-year increase. 
Days services outstanding were 44 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 41 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $85 million. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5 million shares for $588 million at an average price of $116.44 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share for a total of $785 million. This represented an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our quarter 1 results, and we're off to a good start in fiscal '17. 
Now let me turn it back to Pierre."

Our very strong first quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute a strategy that is resonating very well with our clients and driving differentiation for Accenture in the marketplace. We continue to make significant investments to rotate our business to ""the New,"" digital, cloud and security-related services, which together now account for more than 40% of our total revenues and again this quarter grew at a very strong double-digit rate. 
The need to go digital continues to drive strong demand from our clients around the world. We are working with ENGIE, the multinational utility, to transform its retail business model by completely rethinking the customer experience. We are leveraging the service design and innovation of Fjord, part of Accenture Interactive, to help ENGIE create new services to disrupt the market. With Hess, the global energy company, we are implementing a cloud-based As-a-Service operating model. With our cloud solutions and predictive analytics, Hess is able to increase efficiency and improve maintenance across its asset base while benefiting from consumption-based pricing. And we're working with one of Europe's largest home improvement retailers to create and implement a new multichannel strategy to accelerate digital transformation. Our retail experts at Javelin, part of Accenture Strategy, and our designers at Fjord are helping shape and deliver a more personalized customer experience. 
We continue to invest across the business to accelerate our rotation to ""the New,"" both organically and through acquisition. And in the first quarter, we deployed $600 million in strategic acquisition. In digital, we are acquiring OCTO Technology, a leading digital consulting firm based in Paris. We also acquired Karmarama, a creative agency in the U.K.; and Allen International, a design consultancy that specializes in banking. 
In cloud, we acquired DayNine, a leading Workday consulting and services provider; and Nashco Consulting, which expands our capabilities in ServiceNow. In security, we acquired Defense Point Security, enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities for U.S. federal agencies, and we completed the acquisition of Redcore in Australia. We also further strengthened the capabilities of Accenture Strategy with the acquisition of Kurt Salmon, which brings deep expertise in the retail industry. 
At the same time, we continued to leverage our unique position in the technology ecosystem. Our clients value our independence as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players. 
With Google, we formed a new alliance to create industry-specific cloud and mobile solutions to help clients advance their digital transformation agendas and improve business performance. We expanded our Salesforce capabilities to include new platforms for Financial Services, consumer goods and life sciences companies, and we now have significantly more people skilled in Salesforce than any other provider. 
We are always looking ahead to anticipate what's next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation-led approach to help our clients invent the future. A key element is Accenture Ventures, which includes a robust open-innovation program that works with start-ups, accelerators and entrepreneurs, and we recently formed a strategic relationship with Partech Ventures, a leading venture capital firm to help clients tap into the rich pool of innovation from start-ups in Europe and Silicon Valley. 
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to grow ahead of the market in each of our geographic regions. In North America, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in several key industries, including consumer goods, retail and travel services, life sciences and media and entertainment. 
In Europe, we had another strong quarter with 7% growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in several of our major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland as well as high single-digit growth in Spain. And in growth markets, we were very pleased with our 10% growth in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Japan and China. 
In closing, our rotation to ""the New"" is clearly at the heart of our strategy to position Accenture for future growth. The strong capabilities we are building are not only recognized by our clients but also by many prominent industry analysts, and I'm very proud of the recognition we have received for the relevance and depth of our services, ranging from the strength of our overall position in digital services to our specific expertise in analytics, cloud and digital experience, to our leadership in emerging technologies like intelligent automation, Internet of Things and blockchain. So with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with our results and especially with the balance we are striking between delivering results today while continuing to invest to drive future growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you again."

For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '17 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '16 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share, adjusting for the updated FX assumption, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '17 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.87 or 6% to 10% growth over adjusted fiscal '16 results. 
For the full fiscal '17, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. KC?"

I mean, let me start, Tien-tsin, with the fact that when we provide guidance, we provide it because we expect we're going to land in that range. And as pleased as we've been in the past where we've exceeded the range, that hasn't been our intent. We don't set guidance with the expectation that we're going to beat it. So having said that, in that context, again, we're very pleased with 7% growth. And there's really 2 reasons under -- I would say 3 reasons underneath that. One is, is that, that growth does reflect, we believe, significantly higher growth in the market. And when you look at what that means in dollar terms, when you look at the dollar share gains that we've taken underneath that 7% growth, it's tremendous. The second reason we're pleased with the 7% growth is because when you peel underneath the 5 operating groups and look at it across the 13 industries and the 20-some-odd geographic markets that we operate around -- in around the world, the vast majority of those had positive growth and, in many cases, double-digit growth. So if you look at our 13 industries, 5 of the 13 had double-digit growth. And of course, the third reason we're pleased with the growth is because of the continued very strong growth in ""the New."" And so we feel very good about the growth, to be clear. We did signal previously that we had some areas in our business that were more challenged. We've talked about chemicals and natural resources and energy for some time now, and I would say that quarter 1, for the most part, was more of the same, maybe a little bit more pressure in North America in the first quarter. We signaled last quarter that we had a period of lower growth that we were going to be going through in Communications Europe, and that played out as expected. And then I did mention banking and capital markets in North America, which is more attributed to a revenue pattern on a few large clients in the quarter, with the expectation that we'll return to positive growth. But even in banking and capital markets, if you look globally, we had very good growth. And in Europe, in banking and capital markets, we had double-digit growth. So our guidance assumed that growth rates in many of our -- areas of our business would be lower, and that's what's played out. Sorry for that long answer. But Pierre, I'll see if you want to add anything."

If you look at Products specifically, they are doing quite well, both in terms of the top line growth and the profitability. There is no doubt about it. When you look at their expansion in margin, I think, at a high level, I think that's a reflection of 2 things. Number one is I think it's a really good illustration of the power of executing the strategy. So what you see in Products is a high level of rotation to ""the New."" You see a strong component of consulting and strategy services combined, so very much operating kind of at the heart of the industry and the client agenda. And I think what you see in their profitability is a reflection of that. It's the power of being able to really bring, to the fullest extent, our business architecture around 5 businesses rotating in ""the New"" with very, very deep industry expertise. That's what's at play there. As part of that, they also are more efficient just as a tactical point in sales and marketing calls. So overall, we were pleased with our profitability. We were pleased with our contract profitability. We were pleased with our payroll cost structure overall. And as I've said before, when our payroll is efficient and our contract profitability is good, then good things happen. And of course, in the mix, we continue to invest significantly in the business at the same time."

What we believe is, on one hand, it's still certainly early days of this digital transformation. Now as you're saying, we're starting to see some more maturity in the way our clients are buying our services. So we have moved from the very early days of small project or prototype proof of concept, testing the water with digital to try to understand what are the new business models. I think this wave, at least for the B2C, for the B2C, is behind us -- for the business to consumer, sorry, is behind us. And now the business to consumer digital-related services are maturing more rapidly, driving bigger transformation projects. Now if you move to more the B2B related to Internet of Things or industrial Internet, we're still in wave 1, where, indeed, we're working more around prototyping the future, finding user cases for the smart glasses, for the analytics and for the drones and all of the like. And so the maturity probably will come in the next 12 months. So I still see a bit of a difference between the B2C and the B2B. And accordingly, if you look at Accenture, we have been scaling to leadership our services from a B2C standpoint. And I'm thinking, of course, about the great success of Accenture Interactive, where now we are in a leading position. I'm thinking as well of all what we are developing in eCommerce kind of services or analytics supporting as well the business to consumer. And at the same time, we are investing and scaling our services more on the B2B, especially around the Internet of Things, the industrial Internet and other type of services such as artificial intelligence as well."

No doubt that we continue to see that shift in the budget of our clients. Interestingly, the overall budget, including digital, is probably increasing more than decreasing because you have the budget coming from -- for instance, digital advertising and digital marketing now are becoming part of the addressable market for a company like us. So our rotation to digital, cloud and security has opened new opportunities for us, and it's confirmed by the industry analysts, who are all mentioning the shift from legacy technology to digital-related services.

Second, more and more providing that business As-a-Service, which is, of course, contributing to support the agenda of our clients where they move -- they want to move from fixed to variable and CapEx to OpEx. Three, it's going beyond managing Operations, that is bringing analytics, cloud services, amazing richness in what they do. And I truly believe, a tribute to the team, that they have been reinventing the kind of services, and that is why we're growing 10%, which is much more than the BPO business, and gaining significant market share.

We're not quantifying the impact in quarter 1, but it was in the mix this quarter. We don't have a materially -- we don't have a different view from what I commented on 90 days ago. I will say that -- as I said last quarter, I believe, is that the ultimate impact depends on what happens to the stock prices the way the accounting works. And so if the stock price appreciates between when a grant is issued and -- versus when it's awarded, then that creates a tax benefit. If the stock price goes down between the issuance and the date that it's awarded -- well, the award date and the date that you get the share, then it would create a tax headwind or would have a -- negatively impact tax rate. And so it -- to be clear, it will depend, in the future, on what happens to the stock price, and you're looking at the difference between when it was granted and when they actually get the -- it's vested and they get the award."

It's driven by -- obviously, it's an activity-driven cost, depending on opportunity pursuits, closing deals, et cetera. So it does vary by quarter. Having said that, in our fit-for-purpose agenda that we're driving as a multiyear effort to optimize our economics, to create capacity in our P&L, both to meet our margin expansion goals, to drive our share price, but to also, importantly, create significant headroom in our P&L to invest in our business, that is all in the mix of our fit-for-purpose agenda. And this is one example of the power of the focus that we have on increasingly managing each of these businesses and optimizing the economics for each business individually. And that includes optimizing sales and marketing costs for each of the businesses individually, recognizing that the way you approach sales and marketing in a strategy practice is fundamentally different than the way you do it in an operations practice. And so we continue to focus on optimization across all of our business activities and our entire cost structure, where sales -- of which sales and marketing is a key component of that. So we'll see how it goes. It does vary by quarter, but we were pleased with the efficiency of our costs overall in the first quarter, certainly, with the 40 basis points of expansion."

I mean, what's -- you've seen the results these last few quarters around our consulting business, which has been significantly moving up. And of course, the digital has been a driving force on this consulting growth. But when you look at it, you still have the same continuum with clients. It's starting with strategy, and here, more digital strategies than corporate strategies from the past, then you need to create operating models -- digital operating model for clients, and you need to understand very well the industry drivers and disruptions, all of which we're calling Accenture Consulting. Then you build solutions, and this is the job of Accenture Digital and Accenture Technology. And then you operate on behalf of the business if clients want to do that. And at the end of the day, that's why we build this business architecture from strategy to building solutions to operate on behalf of clients. And we are the only one in the marketplace to have this continuum of services because this is what we believe the client is going to buy moving forward. And there's always going to be a role for the outsourcing because, again, you envision the business, you build solutions and you operate solutions. And we want to be a leading company in these 3 activities, if you will. And if you look at digital, indeed, it's starting more with the strategy and the consulting piece of the business, but there are already many activities we have from an outsourcing standpoint. Coming in my mind would be cloud, where we're managing cloud services on behalf of clients; would be cybersecurity, where a significant part of our cybersecurity services are managed services; and three, I'm thinking about the analytics. We are more and more, as well, driving on behalf of the clients, including some marketing campaigns.

So when you look at 85% of our business, it's really a very consistent pattern with what we've seen now for many quarters. We have these few concentrated areas where the market dynamics are such that it has created some challenges in the quarter that we just closed.

We -- again, we are very pleased with our consulting bookings in the quarter, and that goes across strategy and consulting combined and the app development part of app services, and typically, bookings lead to revenue growth.
