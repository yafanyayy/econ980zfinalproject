Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we gro",1294,"Thank you, Elena. 2015 was a transformative year for Alexion, and we enter 2016 with 2 new launches just now underway on top of our strong and growing Solaris-based business. Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we grow and expand our complement franchise while building a premier rare metabolic disease franchise.
In Q4, we achieved many significant commercial R&D and financial milestones. First, we received the FDA approvals for both Strensiq and Kanuma under Breakthrough Therapy designation and also received 2 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers with the approvals.
Second, our commercial team continued to serve a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS with Solaris. Third, we completed enrollment in the DGF registration trial. Fourth, we advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech and presented new clinical data for 3 new highly innovative product candidates being studied in PNH, MPS-IIIB and GI-GVHD. And fifth, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. 
We are pleased that Solaris continues to deliver strong volume growth. As we enter our 10th year since the initial Solaris launch, we delivered 28% year-on-year volume growth in 2015 and continue to see the majority of the opportunity ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS. 
In PNH, in Q4 as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS in Q4, we once again served a consistent number of new patients, supporting our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to our metabolic franchise. Strensiq was approved in the U.S. on October 23. We are now in the very early stages of launching Strensiq in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Our launch is supported by the strong labels, which reflect the highest level of medical innovation. Strensiq addresses the underlying cause of HBP by replacing the vital enzyme of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, enabling babies to have a 97% survival rate at 1 year compared to 42% of historical controlled patients.
On Strensiq, 100% of juvenile onset patients had substantial bone healing improvement in weight and short stature and were able to perform a 6 Minute Walk Test comparable to matched healthy peers. We are pleased with our early performance in the Strensiq launch in Q4, which indicates that applying our unique rare disease expertise from PNH and aHUS has been effective in elevating the awareness of HPV. 
While we have observed early progress, we continue to expect that the launch trajectory for Strensiq will be slow and steady, consistent with the launch of therapies for ultrarare diseases. This is due to the low incidence and high mortality of HPP as well as the very low awareness of the disease.
Now turning to Kanuma, which is our second highly innovative enzyme replacement therapy that was approved by the FDA on December 8 and launched in the U.S. in January. Like Strensiq, our Kanuma launch is supported by the very strong labels in the U.S. and Europe, which again reflect the highest level of medical innovation. 
Kanuma addresses the underlying cause of LAL-D by replacing the vital enzyme of lysosomal acid lipase, enabling babies to have a 67% survival rate beyond 12 months of age compared to 0% of historical controlled patients, all of whom died by 8 months of age. Patients also had improvements in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction in liver fat content. 
As we launch Kanuma, we will bring these compelling clinical benefits to patients with LAL-D, and thus far, we are pleased with the early progress we are making since the acquisition. Patient identification is central to our success in reaching patients with ultrarare diseases. And this is what we know well and do well. 
We saw early on that the LAL-D diagnostic pathway needed to be improved and tailored to pediatric patients to increase rapid and accurate diagnosis. We made our enhancements to the pathway in Q3 and began the rollout in Q4, and we've observed the following: first, more selective testing of high-risk patients; second, a higher rate of positive diagnoses driven by pedantic testing; and third, an increasing number of patients with LAL-D have been identified. 
As we move into Q1, we are looking to extend this meaningful progress. We aim to serve patients across our 50-country platform with HPP and LAL-D. However, for the first year launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, we expect that the majority of patients we serve will be in the U.S. and Germany. We have initiated the country-by-country reimbursement processes throughout Europe as we look to obtain funding and start serving patients in other countries in the second half of 2016 and 2017. 
We are excited about our opportunity across our metabolic franchise and are committed to working with urgency to serve patients with these 2 devastating diseases. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call. 
While we expanded our commercial portfolio, we also advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. In Q4, in addition to completing enrollment in the DGF registration trial, we also presented an initial patient data to put 3 of our highly innovative molecules: first, ALXN1210 data from the initial patients with PNH, showing a rapid reduction in LDH; second, ALXN1007 interim Phase II data from patients with GI-GVHD, showing an 80% overall response rate at 28 days; and third, SBC-103 interim Phase I/II data showing a dose-dependent reduction in heparin sulfate and CSF in patients with MPS-IIIB at 12 weeks, indicating that the NAGLU enzyme administered IV is crossing the blood-brain barrier. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we will have multiple R&D milestones, including: data from 2 registration trials of eculizumab and MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; additional data for ALXN1210 and PNH and initiation of an aHUS clinical program; 6-month heparin sulfate data for SBC-103; and additional data for ALXN1007 and GI-GVHD. We look forward to providing updates on our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking now at our strong financial performance for the full year. We achieved total revenues of $2.6 billion or a 29% increase in volume compared to the prior year, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses and a small initial contribution of $12 million from Strensiq in Q4. In 2015, we delivered 21% total revenue growth compared to 2014 end year sales. Our robust volume growth was partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% constant currency revenue growth year-over-year. For 2016, we forecast $120 million in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding 2016 total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which reflects continued strong underlying demand for Soliris as we serve an increasing number of patients in 2016 as well as strong first year metabolic revenues of $150 million to $175 million. 
These metabolic approvals are the first 2 of up to 8 new product or indication approvals that we committed to deliver through 2018 to drive our next level of growth. Beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q4 despite continued currency headwinds as well as macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries. Q4 revenues reflected the continued steady growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS and the small initial contribution of Strensiq in the U.S. 
Total revenues increased to $701 million in Q4. This revenue growth was driven by a 25% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $45 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in Q4 over the year-ago quarter, resulting in 17% revenue growth above the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris volume growth of 23% was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS across all geographies in Q4. However, volume growth was partially impacted by $15 million in Latin American countries due to end-of-year local government budgetary constraints.
Turning to Strensiq. We were pleased with the initial contribution in the revenues of $12 million in the fourth quarter as we started serving the first group of HPP patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a reminder, we served initial LAL-D patients in Germany in Q4. However, Kanuma was just launched in the U.S. in January 2016. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share.
Turning to the full year. 2015 revenues increased to $2.6 billion, driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in 2015 over the prior year. On a reported basis, this represents 21% revenue growth compared to 2014 end year sales. 
In 2015, we achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provided us with financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth, service our debt, take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise and repurchase stock opportunistically. In 2015, we purchased 2 million shares, and so far this year, we have purchased an additional 0.5 million shares in January. We have an additional $675 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% revenue growth year-over-year. This revenue -- robust revenue growth reflects serving an increasing number of patients in PNH and aHUS as well as the first year of the Strensiq and Kanuma launches, where we forecast metabolic franchise revenues of $150 million to $175 million. For 2016, we currently forecast $120 million or negative 4.6% in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion.
Looking at other elements of our 2016 guidance, supported by continued Soliris growth, the anticipated strength of first year metabolic sales and our ongoing financial discipline, I would highlight the following points: first, we will be advancing our robust rare disease pipeline while maintaining our R&D spend of approximately 22% of revenue, similar to the second half of 2015 levels; second, SG&A expenses will be approximately 26%, which is significantly reduced from second half of 2015 SG&A expenses of 28%; third, we are significantly improving our non-GAAP operating margin in 2016 to 44% from 42% in second half of 2015; and fourth, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5 to $5.20. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been $0.31 higher. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q1 guidance. On a constant currency basis, total revenues would be $735 million to $745 million. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues are expected to be in the range of $700 million to $710 million, which includes a $35 million FX impact year-over-year. On a sequential basis, there is a $10 million negative FX impact as well as fewer infusion days in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015. For Q1, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.10 to $1.15.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in 2015 as we achieved strong Soliris volume growth, executing on the synergy of our integration, successfully launch Strensiq and prepare for the initial launch of Kanuma. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"
347983,322609335,925420,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vikas.

In 2015, our global commercial operations continued to serve more patients with Soliris as we delivered a strong 28% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business while also initiating the launch of Strensiq and Kanuma for patients with HPP and LAL-D.
Starting with Soliris and PNH. The ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives is driving a steady addition of new patients. In 2015, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH across our 50-country platform. We also continued to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. In 2016, we will continue to execute our PNH diagnostic initiatives with the urgency to reach more new patients.
In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 4 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there have been for PNH. 
We continue to see the same trends in Europe. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
With the majority of our opportunity in PNH and aHUS in front of us, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of patients with both diseases in 2016 as in prior years. 
I would like to turn to our global metabolic franchise, starting with Strensiq. In Q4, we saw an initial group of patients commencing treatment and are pleased with our early results as we apply our unique ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP. In the U.S., we are pleased with the initial observation in the early stages of launch. 
First, we are benefiting from having a dedicated metabolic field team, which enables us to reach more physicians who are seeing patients at a higher likelihood of having HPP. Second, our team is focused on overcoming the low awareness of HPP with our disease education initiatives. Our programs address the morbidities and high mortality of HPP, the role of Strensiq in addressing the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme and the compelling clinical benefits that Strensiq can provide to patients with HPP. Third, our diagnostic pathway is helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. And fourth, payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label.
The launches of Strensiq are also underway in Germany and Japan, and we're applying a similar approach as in the U.S. We have now served initial patients in both countries.
Our efforts globally are supported by the growing body of medical evidence [indiscernible] to further support the HPP community. At the upcoming Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting and Endocrine Society meeting, researchers will present new longer-term data for multiple studies on the benefits of Strensiq in infants, children and adults with HPP. As a reminder, we continue to expect that the initial use of Strensiq will grow gradually due to the low incidence, high mortality and low awareness of HPP.
Turning now to Kanuma. We received FDA approval in December and launched in the U.S. just a few weeks ago in January. We are pleased that the approved label allows patients of all ages to be eligible for treatment and includes a survivor benefit for the youngest patients as well as benefits in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction of ALT and liver fat content.
As the Kanuma launch is now underway in the U.S. and Germany, we're applying our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. Following the Synageva integration, we enhanced the LAL-D disease awareness programs. Our more targeted diagnostic pathway helps pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having a LAL-D, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. 
Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. From our early experience thus far, we've seen increased rate of patient identification, supported by more children obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Although there's still very low disease awareness for LAL-D, we are observing both interest and receptivity among the physicians we are reaching. While we are in an earlier stage of initiating our LAL-D disease awareness programs, we see a meaningful opportunity to serve patients, supported by the known prevalence of LAL-D of 8 to 12 patients per 1 million in the general population.
Our global efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the upcoming WORLDSymposium Meeting, we researchers will present 2-year survival data in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding process with health care authorities in other major European countries. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of  2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. 
Also in Japan, we expect regulatory approval for Kanuma in the first half of this year. As we demonstrated by achieving access to Soliris for patients with PNH and aHUS across our platform, we are committed to working with health care authorities around the world to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma.
In closing, the commercial organization has the expertise to achieve our objectives for our 3 products. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we are leveraging our ultrarare disease expertise to serve initial patients with HPP and now LAL-D. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In 2015, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 33 clinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016. 
Starting with our late-stage complement pipeline, our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab continue to progress as planned. In Q4, in kidney transplant, we completed enrollment in our delayed graft function registration trial and expect preliminary data in the second half of 2016. 
In neurology, we have completed enrollment in our refractory myasthenia gravis trial and expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 additional complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, a longer-acting C5 antibody that have a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris, has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of C5 [ph] in healthy volunteers. We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving the ALXN1210 at varying doses and dosing intervals. 
In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals. In December, we announced preliminary data from the initial PNH patients who showed a rapid reduction in LDH of 88% and 85% just 3 weeks after treatment, which is consistent with what we saw in the pivotal Phase III TRIUMPH Study with Soliris. 
We have now completed enrollment in our Phase I/II study of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH and expect data in midyear. And we are also focused on rapidly enrolling our second PNH study. We will also be initiating our clinical program in patients with atypical HUS this year as well as evaluating other indications. We are targeting an approval for ALXN1210 and PNH in 2018.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD. 
Turning now to our robust metabolic pipeline and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with the unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. MPS IIIB is a rare devastating disorder characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
In Q4, we presented interim 3-month data from our Phase I/II study. This study showed a dose-dependent reduction of heparan sulfate levels in cerebral spinal fluid in 3 dosing cohorts with a mean reduction of 11% observed at the highest 3 milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has the potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration. We will now move to see if the dose-dependent response is maintained over a 6-month dosing period and are pleased that the data will be presented as a latebreaking poster at the WORLDSymposium next month.
The interim data for SBC-103 provides evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs, 3 metabolic and 1 additional candidate from a growing complement inhibitor portfolio to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple catalysts in our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

So we have to factor that into our guidance in 2016. So we think that the business as usual is ongoing from February onwards. Regarding the broader picture of -- and your math is absolutely right, $600 million and $450 million. So if you recall after -- in the beginning of 2015, I talked about the impact of foreign exchange overall for us is going to be $320 million going into 2015 compared to 2014, right? Out of that, the hedge is going to take half of it out. So the hedge definitely helped us in 2015. But going into '16 and '17 that the remainder $160 million is going to get impacted. So what you see here is it's the $450 million growth is now adjusted for that FX impact that was felt between '14 and '15. And so now from '15 to '16, there will be an additional $120 million. Now it is not purely attributable to the growth. It is actually the base is also getting impacted. So if you really think through the 2 phases, if you look at 2015 number once again, what you see is $2.6 billion with the starting line. And when you suddenly get to 1st of January, that number is $120 million less. So you're starting from that number and we're adding that $450 million. Does that answer your question?"

So what we have looked at here is a very financially disciplined growth of literally 10% to 12%, much, much lower than what the top line growth is going to be. And we'll continue this process as we go forward in '17 and '18. So we take that 22% of sales down below 20% by the time we get to 2018.

So Martin can talk you through that, but the reason why I mentioned the preclinical data, remember, we also showed the preclinical data at the 5- and the 10-milligram per kilogram dose, showing more reduction in the preclinical models of heparan sulfate in the brain.

Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we grow and expand our complement franchise, while building a premier, rare metabolic disease franchise.
In Q4, we achieved many significant commercial R&D and financial milestones. First, we received the FDA approvals for both Strensiq and Kanuma under Breakthrough Therapy designation and also received 2 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers with the approvals.
Second, our commercial team continued to serve a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS with Solaris. Third, we completed enrollment in the DGF registration trial. Fourth, we advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech and presented new clinical data for 3 new highly innovative product candidates being studied in PNH, MPS IIIB and GI-GVHD. And fifth, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. 
We are pleased that Solaris continues to deliver strong volume growth. As we enter our 10th year since the initial Solaris launch, we delivered 28% year-on-year volume growth in 2015 and continue to see the majority of the opportunity ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS. 
In PNH, in Q4 as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS in Q4, we once again served a consistent number of new patients, supporting our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to our metabolic franchise. Strensiq was approved in the U.S. on October 23. We are now in the very early stages of launching Strensiq in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Our launch is supported by the strong labels, which reflect the highest level of medical innovation. Strensiq addresses the underlying cause of HPP by replacing the vital enzyme of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, enabling babies to have a 97% survival rate at 1 year compared to 42% of historical controlled patients.
On Strensiq, 100% of juvenile onset patients had substantial bone healing improvement in weight and short stature and were able to perform a 6 Minute Walk Test comparable to matched healthy peers. We are pleased with our early performance in the Strensiq launch in Q4, which indicates that applying our unique rare disease expertise from PNH and aHUS has been effective in elevating the awareness of HPP. 
While we have observed early progress, we continue to expect that the launch trajectory for Strensiq will be slow and steady, consistent with the launch of therapies for ultrarare diseases. This is due to the low incidence and high mortality of HPP as well as the very low awareness of the disease.
Now turning to Kanuma, which is our second highly innovative enzyme replacement therapy that was approved by the FDA on December 8 and launched in the U.S. in January. Like Strensiq, our Kanuma launch is supported by the very strong labels in the U.S. and Europe, which again reflect the highest level of medical innovation. 
Kanuma addresses the underlying cause of LAL-D by replacing the vital enzyme of lysosomal acid lipase, enabling babies to have a 67% survival rate beyond 12 months of age compared to 0% of historical controlled patients, all of whom died by 8 months of age. Patients also had improvements in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction in liver fat content. 
As we launch Kanuma, we will bring these compelling clinical benefits to patients with LAL-D, and thus far, we are pleased with the early progress we are making since the acquisition. Patient identification is central to our success in reaching patients with ultrarare diseases. And this is what we know well and do well. 
We saw early on that the LAL-D diagnostic pathway needed to be improved and tailored to pediatric patients to increase rapid and accurate diagnosis. We made our enhancements to the pathway in Q3 and began the rollout in Q4, and we've observed the following: first, more selective testing of high-risk patients; second, a higher rate of positive diagnoses driven by pediatric testing; and third, an increasing number of patients with LAL-D have been identified.
As we move into Q1, we are looking to extend this meaningful progress. We aim to serve patients across our 50-country platform with HPP and LAL-D. However, for the first year launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, we expect that the majority of patients we serve will be in the U.S. and Germany. We have initiated the country-by-country reimbursement processes throughout Europe as we look to obtain funding and start serving patients in other countries in the second half of 2016 and 2017. 
We are excited about our opportunity across our metabolic franchise and are committed to working with urgency to serve patients with these 2 devastating diseases. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call. 
While we expanded our commercial portfolio, we also advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. In Q4, in addition to completing enrollment in the DGF registration trial, we also presented an initial patient data to put 3 of our highly innovative molecules: first, ALXN1210 data from the initial patients with PNH, showing a rapid reduction in LDH; second, ALXN1007 interim Phase II data from patients with GI-GVHD, showing an 80% overall response rate at 28 days; and third, SBC-103 interim Phase I/II data showing a dose-dependent reduction in heparin sulfate and CSF in patients with MPS IIIB at 12 weeks, indicating that the NAGLU enzyme administered IV is crossing the blood-brain barrier. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we will have multiple R&D milestones, including: data from 2 registration trials of eculizumab and MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; additional data for ALXN1210 and PNH and initiation of an aHUS clinical program; 6-month heparin sulfate data for SBC-103; and additional data for ALXN1007 and GI-GVHD. We look forward to providing updates on our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking now at our strong financial performance for the full year. We achieved total revenues of $2.6 billion or a 29% increase in volume compared to the prior year, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses and a small initial contribution of $12 million from Strensiq in Q4. In 2015, we delivered 21% total revenue growth compared to 2014 in-year sales. Our robust volume growth was partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% constant currency revenue growth year-over-year. For 2016, we forecast $120 million in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding 2016 total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which reflects continued strong underlying demand for Soliris as we serve an increasing number of patients in 2016 as well as strong first year metabolic revenues of $150 million to $175 million. 
These metabolic approvals are the first 2 of up to 8 new product or indication approvals that we committed to deliver through 2018 to drive our next level of growth. Beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q4 despite continued currency headwinds as well as macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries. Q4 revenues reflected the continued steady growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS and the small initial contribution of Strensiq in the U.S. 
Total revenues increased to $701 million in Q4. This revenue growth was driven by a 25% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $45 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in Q4 over the year-ago quarter, resulting in 17% revenue growth above the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris volume growth of 23% was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS across all geographies in Q4. However, volume growth was partially impacted by $15 million in Latin American countries due to end-of-year local government budgetary constraints.
Turning to Strensiq. We were pleased with the initial contribution in the revenues of $12 million in the fourth quarter as we started serving the first group of HPP patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a reminder, we served initial LAL-D patients in Germany in Q4. However, Kanuma was just launched in the U.S. in January 2016. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share.
Turning to the full year. 2015 revenues increased to $2.6 billion, driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in 2015 over the prior year. On a reported basis, this represents 21% revenue growth compared to 2014 end year sales. 
In 2015, we achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provided us with financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth, service our debt, take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise and repurchase stock opportunistically. In 2015, we purchased 2 million shares, and so far this year, we have purchased an additional 0.5 million shares in January. We have an additional $675 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% revenue growth year-over-year. This revenue -- robust revenue growth reflects serving an increasing number of patients in PNH and aHUS as well as the first year of the Strensiq and Kanuma launches, where we forecast metabolic franchise revenues of $150 million to $175 million. For 2016, we currently forecast $120 million or negative 4.6% in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion.
Looking at other elements of our 2016 guidance, supported by continued Soliris growth, the anticipated strength of first year metabolic sales and our ongoing financial discipline, I would highlight the following points: first, we will be advancing our robust rare disease pipeline, while maintaining our R&D spend of approximately 22% of revenue, similar to the second half of 2015 levels; second, SG&A expenses will be approximately 26%, which is significantly reduced from second half of 2015 SG&A expenses of 28%; third, we are significantly improving our non-GAAP operating margin in 2016 to 44% from 42% in second half of 2015; and fourth, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5 to $5.20. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been $0.31 higher. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q1 guidance. On a constant currency basis, total revenues would be $735 million to $745 million. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues are expected to be in the range of $700 million to $710 million, which includes a $35 million FX impact year-over-year. On a sequential basis, there is a $10 million negative FX impact as well as fewer infusion days in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015. For Q1, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.10 to $1.15.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in 2015 as we achieved strong Soliris volume growth, executed on the synergy of our integration, successfully launched Strensiq and prepare for the initial launch of Kanuma. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

In 2015, our global commercial operations continued to serve more patients with Soliris as we delivered a strong 28% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business, while also initiating the launch of Strensiq and Kanuma for patients with HPP and LAL-D.
Starting with Soliris and PNH. The ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives is driving a steady addition of new patients. In 2015, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH across our 50-country platform. We also continued to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. In 2016, we will continue to execute our PNH diagnostic initiatives with the urgency to reach more new patients.
In aHUS, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 4 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH.
We continued to see the same trends in Europe. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
With the majority of our opportunity in PNH and aHUS in front of us, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of patients with both diseases in 2016 as in prior years. 
I would like to turn to our global metabolic franchise, starting with Strensiq. In Q4, we saw an initial group of patients commencing treatment and are pleased with our early results as we apply our unique ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP. In the U.S., we are pleased with the initial observation in the early stages of launch. 
First, we are benefiting from having a dedicated metabolic field team, which enables us to reach more physicians who are seeing patients at a higher likelihood of having HPP. Second, our team is focused on overcoming the low awareness of HPP with our disease education initiatives. Our programs address the morbidities and high mortality of HPP, the role of Strensiq in addressing the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme and the compelling clinical benefits that Strensiq can provide to patients with HPP. Third, our diagnostic pathway is helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. And fourth, payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label.
The launches of Strensiq are also underway in Germany and Japan, and we're applying a similar approach as in the U.S. We have now served initial patients in both countries.
Our efforts globally are supported by the growing body of medical community studies to further support the HPP community. At the upcoming Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting and Endocrine Society meeting, researchers will present new longer-term data for multiple studies on the benefits of Strensiq in infants, children and adults with HPP. As a reminder, we continue to expect that the initial use of Strensiq will grow gradually due to the low incidence, high mortality and low awareness of HPP.
Turning now to Kanuma. We received FDA approval in December and launched in the U.S. just a few weeks ago in January. We are pleased that the approved label allows patients of all ages to be eligible for treatment and includes a survivor benefit for the youngest patients as well as benefits in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction of ALT and liver fat content.
As the Kanuma launch is now underway in the U.S. and Germany, we're applying our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. Following the Synageva integration, we enhanced the LAL-D disease awareness programs. Our more targeted diagnostic pathway helps pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having a LAL-D, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. 
Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. From our early experience thus far, we've seen increased rate of patient identification, supported by more children obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Although there's still very low disease awareness for LAL-D, we are observing both interest and receptivity among the physicians we are reaching. While we are in an earlier stage of initiating our LAL-D disease awareness programs, we see a meaningful opportunity to serve patients, supported by the known prevalence of LAL-D of 8 to 12 patients per 1 million in the general population.
Our global efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the upcoming WORLDSymposium Meeting, researchers will present 2-year survival data in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding process with health care authorities in other major European countries. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of  2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. 
Also in Japan, we expect regulatory approval for Kanuma in the first half of this year. As we demonstrated by achieving access to Soliris for patients with PNH and aHUS across our platform, we are committed to working with health care authorities around the world to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma.
In closing, the commercial organization has the expertise to achieve our objectives for our 3 products. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we are leveraging our ultrarare disease expertise to serve initial patients with HPP and now LAL-D. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In 2015, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 clinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016.
Starting with our late-stage complement pipeline, our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab continued to progress as planned. In Q4, in kidney transplant, we completed enrollment in our delayed graft function registration trial and expect preliminary data in the second half of 2016.
In neurology, we have completed enrollment in our refractory myasthenia gravis trial and expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 additional complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, a longer-acting C5 antibody that has a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris, has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5 in healthy volunteers. We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving the ALXN1210 at varying doses and dosing intervals. 
In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals. In December, we announced preliminary data from the initial PNH patients who has showed a rapid reduction in LDH of 88% and 85% just 3 weeks after treatment, which is consistent with what we saw in the pivotal Phase III TRIUMPH Study with Soliris. 
We have now completed enrollment in our Phase I/II study of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH and expect data in midyear. And we are also focused on rapidly enrolling our second PNH study. We will also be initiating our clinical program in patients with atypical HUS this year as well as evaluating other indications. We are targeting an approval for ALXN1210 and PNH in 2018.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD. 
Turning now to our robust metabolic pipeline and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with the unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. MPS IIIB is a rare devastating disorder characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
In Q4, we presented interim 3-month data from our Phase I/II study. This study showed a dose-dependent reduction of heparan sulfate levels in cerebral spinal fluid in 3 dosing cohorts with a mean reduction of 11% observed at the highest 3 milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has the potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration. We will now want to see if the dose-dependent response is maintained over a 6-month dosing period and are pleased that the data will be presented as a late-breaking poster at the WORLDSymposium next month.
The interim data for SBC-103 provides evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs, 3 metabolic and 1 additional candidate from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple catalysts in our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. 
I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

And then second, maybe a broader picture on the guidance. If I do the math looking at 2014 sales into 2015 sales, because if you correct out for the net stocking effect in 2016 and the FX impact, you actually would have grown sales about $600 million year-over-year in 2015. Yet the 2016 guidance is calling for, again, netting out the FX impact, about $450 million in year-on-year growth. So trying to reconcile that with David's comments that the new patient adds are very steady. I'm sure there's some issue with my math. Maybe you could help figure that out."

So we had a bet with Martin that I'll get the first question, so thanks a lot for that. I won the bet. So let's talk about Brazil first. We had a $15 million impact in Brazil as the year-end government restrictions delayed the orders. We feel that we have sorted out the issues right now in February. So we have to factor that into our guidance in 2016. So we think that the business as usual is ongoing from February onwards. Regarding the broader picture of -- and your math is absolutely right, $600 million and $450 million. So if you recall after -- in the beginning of 2015, I talked about the impact of foreign exchange overall for us is going to be $320 million going into 2015 compared to 2014, right? Out of that, the hedge is going to take half of it out. So the hedge definitely helped us in 2015. But going into '16 and '17 that the remainder $160 million is going to get impacted. So what you see here is it's the $450 million growth is now adjusted for that FX impact that was felt between '14 and '15. And so now from '15 to '16, there will be an additional $120 million. Now it is not purely attributable to the growth. It is actually the base is also getting impacted. So if you really think through the 2 phases, if you look at 2015 number once again, what you see is $2.6 billion with a starting line. And when you suddenly get to 1st of January, that number is $120 million less. So you're starting from that number and you're adding that $450 million. Does that answer your question?"

And so that's the intention of the program moving forward. But Martin can provide more color on the frequency of the CSF in the next steps."

And then your third one is really a basic pharmacology question about how high can you go up with dose escalation? And this applies to any program, as you know better than I do. Given the devastating nature of the disease, the encouraging results that we see, particularly the 3 milligram per kilogram dose, our ability to go higher than that is clear and is something that we want to do. We will also, as always, be very careful. We'll be looking at safety along the way, such that we do proper dose escalation studies and these will unfold over the next period."

347983,322609335,925897,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Elena. 2015 was a transformative year for Alexion, and we enter 2016 with 2 new launches just now underway on top of our strong and growing Soliris-based business. Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we gro",1292,"Thank you, Elena. 2015 was a transformative year for Alexion, and we enter 2016 with 2 new launches just now underway on top of our strong and growing Soliris-based business. Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we grow and expand our complement franchise, while building a premier, rare metabolic disease franchise.
In Q4, we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. First, we received FDA approvals for both Strensiq and Kanuma under Breakthrough Therapy designation and also received 2 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers with the approvals.
Second, our commercial team continued to serve a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS with Soliris. Third, we completed enrollment in the DGF registration trial. Fourth, we advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech and presented new clinical data for 3 new highly innovative product candidates being studied in PNH, MPS IIIB and GI-GVHD. And fifth, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. 
We are pleased that Soliris continues to deliver strong volume growth. As we enter our 10th year since the initial Soliris launch, we delivered 28% year-on-year volume growth in 2015 and continue to see the majority of the opportunity ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS. 
In PNH, in Q4 as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS in Q4, we once again served a consistent number of new patients, supporting our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to our metabolic franchise. Strensiq was approved in the U.S. on October 23. We are now in the very early stages of launching Strensiq in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Our launch is supported by the strong labels which reflect the highest level of medical innovation. Strensiq addresses the underlying cause of HPP by replacing the vital enzyme of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, enabling babies to have a 97% survival rate at 1 year compared to 42% of historical control patients.
On Strensiq, 100% of juvenile onset patients had substantial bone healing, improvement in weight and short stature and were able to perform a 6 Minute Walk Test comparable to matched healthy peers. We are pleased with our early performance in the Strensiq launch in Q4, which indicates that applying our unique rare disease expertise from PNH and aHUS has been effective in elevating the awareness of HPP. 
While we have observed early progress, we continue to expect that the launch trajectory for Strensiq will be slow and steady, consistent with the launch of therapies for ultrarare diseases. This is due to the low incidence and high mortality of HPP as well as the very low awareness of the disease.
Now turning to Kanuma, which is our second highly innovative enzyme replacement therapy that was approved by the FDA on December 8 and launched in the U.S. in January. Like Strensiq, our Kanuma launch is supported by the very strong labels in the U.S. and Europe, which again reflect the highest level of medical innovation. 
Kanuma addresses the underlying cause of LAL-D by replacing the vital enzyme of lysosomal acid lipase, enabling babies to have a 67% survival rate beyond 12 months of age compared to 0% of historical control patients, all of whom died by 8 months of age. Patients also had improvements in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction in liver fat content. 
As we launch Kanuma, we will bring these compelling clinical benefits to patients with LAL-D, and thus far, we are pleased with the early progress we are making since the acquisition. Patient identification is central to our success in reaching patients with ultrarare diseases. And this is what we know well and do well. 
We saw early on that the LAL-D diagnostic pathway needed to be improved and tailored to pediatric patients to increase rapid and accurate diagnosis. We made our enhancements to the pathway in Q3 and began the rollout in Q4, and we've observed the following: first, more selective testing of high-risk patients; second, a higher rate of positive diagnoses driven by pediatric testing; and third, an increasing number of patients with LAL-D have been identified.
As we move into Q1, we are looking to extend this meaningful progress. We aim to serve patients across our 50-country platform with HPP and LAL-D. However, for the first year launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, we expect that the majority of patients we serve will be in the U.S. and Germany. We have initiated the country-by-country reimbursement processes throughout Europe as we look to obtain funding and start serving patients in other countries in the second half of 2016 and 2017. 
We are excited about our opportunity across our metabolic franchise and are committed to working with urgency to serve patients with these 2 devastating diseases. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call. 
While we expanded our commercial portfolio, we also advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. In Q4, in addition to completing enrollment in the DGF registration trial, we also presented initial patient data for 3 of our highly innovative molecules: first, ALXN1210 data from the initial patients with PNH, showing a rapid reduction in LDH; second, ALXN1007 interim Phase II data from patients with GI-GVHD, showing an 80% overall response rate at 28 days; and third, SBC-103 interim Phase I/II data showing a dose-dependent reduction in heparin sulfate and CSF in patients with MPS IIIB at 12 weeks, indicating that the NAGLU enzyme administered IV is crossing the blood-brain barrier. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we will have multiple R&D milestones, including: data from 2 registration trials of eculizumab and MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; additional data for ALXN1210 and PNH and initiation of an aHUS clinical program; 6-month heparin sulfate data for SBC-103; and additional data for ALXN1007 and GI-GVHD. We look forward to providing updates on our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking now at our strong financial performance for the full year. We achieved total revenues of $2.6 billion or a 29% increase in volume compared to the prior year, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses and a small initial contribution of $12 million from Strensiq in Q4. In 2015, we delivered 21% total revenue growth compared to 2014 in-year sales. Our robust volume growth was partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% constant currency revenue growth year-over-year. For 2016, we forecast $120 million in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding 2016 total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which reflects continued strong underlying demand for Soliris as we serve an increasing number of patients in 2016 as well as strong first year metabolic revenues of $150 million to $175 million. 
These metabolic approvals are the first 2 of up to 8 new product or indication approvals that we committed to deliver through 2018 to drive our next level of growth. Beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q4 despite continued currency headwinds as well as macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries. Q4 revenues reflected the continued steady growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS and the small initial contribution of Strensiq in the U.S. 
Total revenues increased to $701 million in Q4. This revenue growth was driven by a 25% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $45 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in Q4 over the year-ago quarter, resulting in 17% revenue growth above the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris volume growth of 23% was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS across all geographies in Q4. However, volume growth was partially impacted by $15 million in Latin American countries due to end-of-year local government budgetary constraints.
Turning to Strensiq. We were pleased with the initial contribution in the revenues of $12 million in the fourth quarter as we started serving the first group of HPP patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a reminder, we served initial LAL-D patients in Germany in Q4. However, Kanuma was just launched in the U.S. in January 2016. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share.
Turning to the full year. 2015 revenues increased to $2.6 billion, driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges, in 2015 over the prior year. On a reported basis, this represents 21% revenue growth compared to 2014 in-year sales. 
In 2015, we achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provided us with financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth, service our debt, take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise and repurchase stock opportunistically. In 2015, we purchased 2 million shares, and so far this year, we have purchased an additional 0.5 million shares in January. We have an additional $675 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% revenue growth year-over-year. This revenue -- robust revenue growth reflects serving an increasing number of patients in PNH and aHUS as well as the first year of the Strensiq and Kanuma launches, where we forecast metabolic franchise revenues of $150 million to $175 million. For 2016, we currently forecast $120 million or negative 4.6% in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion.
Looking at other elements of our 2016 guidance, supported by continued Soliris growth, the anticipated strength of first year metabolic sales and our ongoing financial discipline, I would highlight the following points: first, we will be advancing our robust rare disease pipeline, while maintaining our R&D spend of approximately 22% of revenue, similar to the second half of 2015 levels; second, SG&A expenses will be approximately 26%, which is significantly reduced from second half of 2015 SG&A expenses of 28%; third, we are significantly improving our non-GAAP operating margin in 2016 to 44% from 42% in second half of 2015; and fourth, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5 to $5.20. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been $0.31 higher. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q1 guidance. On a constant currency basis, total revenues would be $735 million to $745 million. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues are expected to be in the range of $700 million to $710 million, which includes a $35 million FX impact year-over-year. On a sequential basis, there is a $10 million negative FX impact as well as fewer infusion days in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015. For Q1, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.10 to $1.15.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.
In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in 2015 as we achieved strong Soliris volume growth, executed on the synergy of our integration, successfully launched Strensiq and prepare for the initial launch of Kanuma. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

In 2015, our global commercial operations continued to serve more patients with Soliris as we delivered a strong 28% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business, while also initiating the launch of Strensiq and Kanuma for patients with HPP and LAL-D.
Starting with Soliris and PNH. The ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives is driving a steady addition of new patients. In 2015, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH across our 50-country platform. We also continued to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. In 2016, we will continue to execute our PNH diagnostic initiatives with the urgency to reach more new patients.
In aHUS, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 4 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH.
We continued to see the same trends in Europe. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
With the majority of our opportunity in PNH and aHUS in front of us, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of patients with both diseases in 2016 as in prior years. 
I would like to turn to our global metabolic franchise, starting with Strensiq. In Q4, we saw an initial group of patients commencing treatment and are pleased with our early results as we apply our unique ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP. In the U.S., we are pleased with the initial observation in the early stages of launch. 
First, we are benefiting from having a dedicated metabolic field team, which enables us to reach more physicians who are seeing patients at a higher likelihood of having HPP. Second, our team is focused on overcoming the low awareness of HPP with our disease education initiatives. Our programs address the morbidities and high mortality of HPP, the role of Strensiq in addressing the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme and the compelling clinical benefits that Strensiq can provide to patients with HPP. Third, our diagnostic pathway is helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. And fourth, payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label.
The launches of Strensiq are also underway in Germany and Japan, and we're applying a similar approach as in the U.S. We have now served initial patients in both countries.
Our efforts globally are supported by the growing body of medical evidence [indiscernible] to further support the HPP community. At the upcoming Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting and Endocrine Society meeting, researchers will present new longer-term data for multiple studies on the benefits of Strensiq in infants, children and adults with HPP. As a reminder, we continue to expect that the initial use of Strensiq will grow gradually due to the low incidence, high mortality and low awareness of HPP.
Turning now to Kanuma. We received FDA approval in December and launched in the U.S. just a few weeks ago in January. We are pleased that the approved label allows patients of all ages to be eligible for treatment and includes a survivor benefit for the youngest patients as well as benefits in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction in ALT and liver fat content. 
As the Kanuma launch is now underway in the U.S. and Germany, we're applying our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. Following the Synageva integration, we enhanced the LAL-D disease awareness programs. Our more targeted diagnostic pathway helps pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having a LAL-D, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. 
Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. From our early experience thus far, we've seen increased rate of patient identification, supported by more children obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Although there's still very low disease awareness for LAL-D, we are observing both interest and receptivity among the physicians we are reaching. While we are in an earlier stage of initiating our LAL-D disease awareness programs, we see a meaningful opportunity to serve patients, supported by the known prevalence of LAL-D of 8 to 12 patients per 1 million in the general population.
Our global efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the upcoming WORLDSymposium meeting, researchers will present 2-year survival data in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding process with health care authorities in other major European countries. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. 
Also in Japan, we expect regulatory approval for Kanuma in the first half of this year. As we demonstrated by achieving access to Soliris for patients with PNH and aHUS across our platform, we are committed to working with health care authorities around the world to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma.
In closing, the commercial organization has the expertise to achieve our objectives for our 3 products. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we are leveraging our ultrarare disease expertise to serve initial patients with HPP and now LAL-D. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In 2015, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 preclinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016.
Starting with our late-stage complement pipeline, our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab continued to progress as planned. In Q4, in kidney transplant, we completed enrollment in our delayed graft function registration trial and expect preliminary data in the second half of 2016.
In neurology, we have completed enrollment in our refractory myasthenia gravis trial and expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 additional complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, a longer-acting C5 antibody that has a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris, has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5 in healthy volunteers. We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving the ALXN1210 at varying doses and dosing intervals. 
In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals. In December, we announced preliminary data from the initial PNH patients, which showed a rapid reduction in LDH of 88% and 85% just 3 weeks after treatment, which is consistent with what we saw in the pivotal Phase III TRIUMPH Study with Soliris. 
We have now completed enrollment in our Phase I/II study of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH and expect data in midyear. And we are also focused on rapidly enrolling our second PNH study. We will also be initiating our clinical program in patients with atypical HUS this year as well as evaluating other indications. We are targeting an approval for ALXN1210 and PNH in 2018.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD. 
Turning now to our robust metabolic pipeline and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with the unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB. MPS IIIB is a rare, devastating disorder characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
In Q4, we presented interim 3-month data from our Phase I/II study. This study showed a dose-dependent reduction of heparan sulfate levels in cerebral spinal fluid in 3 dosing cohorts with a mean reduction of 11% observed at the highest 3 milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has the potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration. We will now look to see if the dose-dependent response is maintained over a 6-month dosing period and are pleased that the data will be presented as a late-breaking poster at the WORLDSymposium next month.
The interim data for SBC-103 provides evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs, 3 metabolic and 1 additional candidate from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple catalysts in our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

Yet the 2016 guidance is calling for, again, netting out the FX impact, about $450 million in year-on-year growth.

So we had a bet with Martin that I'll get the first question, so thanks a lot for that. I won the bet. So let's talk about Brazil first. We had a $15 million impact in Brazil as the year-end government restrictions delayed the orders. We feel that we have sorted out the issues right now in February. So we have to factor that into our guidance in 2016. So we think that the business as usual is ongoing from February onwards. Regarding the broader picture of -- and your math is absolutely right, $600 million and $450 million. So if you recall after -- in the beginning of 2015, I had talked about the impact of foreign exchange overall for us is going to be $320 million going into 2015 compared to 2014, right? Out of that, the hedge is going to take half of it out. So the hedge definitely helped us in 2015. But going into '16 and '17 that the remainder $160 million is going to get impacted. So what you see here is it's the $450 million growth is now adjusted for that FX impact that was felt between '14 and '15. And so now from '15 to '16, there will be an additional $120 million. Now it is not purely attributable to the growth. It is actually the base is also getting impacted. So if you really think through the 2 phases, if you look at 2015 number once again, what you see is $2.6 billion with a starting line. And when you suddenly get to 1st of January, that number is $120 million less. So you're starting from that number and you're adding that $450 million. Does that answer your question?"

So Martin can talk you through that, but the reason why I mention the preclinical data, remember, we also showed the preclinical data at the 5- and the 10-milligram per kilogram dose, showing more reduction in the preclinical models of heparan sulfate in the brain.

In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.",928,"Thank you, Elena. In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders. 
During the quarter, we achieved many commercial and R&D milestones. First, we grew our core Soliris business, largely driven by a steady number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Second, we progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries, with the strong addition of new patients. Third, we commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma and began to serve initial patients with LAL-D. And fourth, we advanced our robust rare disease pipeline, including exceeding target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed in 2 initial studies of ALXN1210 and patients with PNH; commencing the planned dose escalation for SBC-103. As 6-month data showed, a potential for an IV therapy across the blood-brain barrier for patients with MPS IIIB; and progressing 3 registration studies of eculizumab with MG data expected midyear, DGF data expected in the second half of 2016 and the NMO trial on track to complete enrollment this year. 
Looking at Soliris in Q1, we grew our core business by serving a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we've been operating the longest. This was offset by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin American countries primarily in Brazil and Argentina. Despite the weakness in Latin America, we continue to see the majority of growth ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform.
Looking more closely at PNH in Q1, globally, we identified and served a high number of newly diagnosed patients by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the life-transforming benefits of Soliris to more patients in 2016 and beyond. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
In aHUS in Q1, we once again served a consistent number of new patients who presented with complement mediated CMA. Matched for time now 18 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. And we continue to see the same trends in Europe, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our performance in Q1 as we served a growing number of new patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan, driven by our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. 
Also in the quarter, we continued to have success early in the launch in identifying both newly and previously diagnosed patients with HPP. As we continue to apply our expertise, we are confident that our work with the medical community will enable physicians to make a more rapid and accurate diagnosis and better informed treatment decisions for a growing number of patients with HPP over time. 
Now looking at Kanuma, we commenced the U.S. launch in early Q1 and are now making progress serving initial patients with LAL-D in both the U.S. and Germany. In order to reach more children with LAL-D faster, we are educating pediatric specialists and have enhanced our diagnostic pathway to aid patient identification and earlier treatment. 
While these improvements are leading to an increase in testing and appropriate patients, we are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of our target physicians. Throughout 2016, we look forward to serve an increasing number of new patients with HPP and LAL-D in the U.S., Germany and Japan while we progress our country-by-country funding processes throughout Europe. Carson will provide more color on the launches later in the call.
Looking ahead for the year, we have multiple R&D milestones, including several highlights from our ALXN1210 program, including: additional data and PNH and the initiation of an aHUS clinical program; data from the registration trials of eculizumab and MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; and continued development of SBC-103 with a planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II study in MPS IIIB. We look forward to providing updates on our robust pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $701 million, a 24% increase in volume compared to the year-ago quarter. Our revenue was negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges in Q1 over the year-ago quarter. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, primarily due to increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, partially offset by early strength of the Strensiq launch and the strengthening of foreign currencies versus our previous expectations. We also expect 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the previously guided range of $5 to $5.20 per diluted share. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

This 17% revenue growth was driven by a 24% increase in volume, negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds compared to the year-ago quarter. Soliris revenues were $665 m",630,"Thanks, David. In Q1, total revenues increased to $701 million. This 17% revenue growth was driven by a 24% increase in volume, negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $665 million in Q1. While growth in our core territories remains strong, Soliris revenue growth was impacted mainly by 3 factors: increasing macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, resulting in an impact to new patient starts and treatment interruptions primarily in Brazil and Argentina; currency headwinds; and our usual seasonality that we see every year as we move from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, Soliris volume growth was 18% and was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS.
Turning to our metabolic therapies. We are very pleased to report Strensiq revenues of $33 million as we progress our initial launches in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In addition, we achieved Kanuma revenues of $2.5 million in our first quarter of the U.S. launch. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion in debt. In Q1, we purchased 2 million shares and have approximately $416 [ph] million remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes: investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches; advancing our robust pipeline; taking advantage of external opportunities; and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. Soliris revenues will be in the range of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion. While we continue to see growth in our core territories and expect to benefit from strengthening foreign currencies, we expect Soliris revenue growth in 2016 to continue to be negatively impacted by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America. 
At this point, we are expecting to see continued weakness in the region for the remainder of the year. Latin America accounts for approximately 10% of Soliris revenues. And our updated Soliris guidance reflects our forecast that approximately 20% to 30% of our Latin American revenues are at risk in 2016.
In addition, we are now forecasting total metabolic revenues to be above our previous expectations and are guiding to a range of $180 million to $200 million due to the early strength we are seeing in the Strensiq launch. 
Looking at our expenses, we are guiding to the high end of the range, primarily due to 3 factors: investing in key programs in our robust pipeline; advancing the global commercial launches of Strensiq and Kanuma; and the strengthening of foreign currencies. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $5 to $5.20. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q2 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $735 million to $745 million, which includes a $20 million to $25 million negative FX impact year-over-year. As a reminder, as in prior years, Q2 expenses will be higher than Q1. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.12 to $1.17.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and PNH and aHUS by serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq and Kanuma and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018.

Starting with Soliris. We grew our core business, driven by a consistently high number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, offset by macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, impacting new patient starts and causing treatment interruptions in the region.

Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we continue to expect that over time, our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS will be larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris at first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
During the quarter, we continued to identify a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform. And we continue to see the majority of our opportunity in both diseases in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to our initial country launches of our 2 highly innovative newly-approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In the U.S. in Q1, we are very pleased with the early stages of launch. Our revenues in the quarter benefited from: identification of patients prior to approval; clinical trial patient transitions; and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. 
In Q2 and beyond, we will create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. And payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label. 
Our growing body of medical evidence continues to enhance our understanding of HPP. Importantly, new longer-term data presented at Endo this month showed sustained improvements in survival rates, bone healing, respiratory support and growth and morbidity in children with HPP with ongoing Strensiq treatment. As the U.S. launch of Strensiq progresses, we are also applying key learnings to the other initial launch countries of Germany and Japan where we're also serving patients with HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We commenced the launch in the U.S. in January and are now serving initial patients as we apply our deep expertise in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. To support our launch, we are deploying disease education programs and more targeted diagnostic initiatives. These efforts are helping pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance for early diagnosis. 
This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years. With our diagnostic and disease education programs underway, we're observing both interest and receptivity and an increase in testing rates in children with liver and lipid abnormalities. We expect these programs directed at pediatric specialists to help accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time.
While our field teams are educating physicians to increase testing in appropriate patients, we continue to accelerate our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to drive more testing with a greater number of our target physicians. 
Our efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the WORLDSymposium meeting in March, new 2-year data in infants with rapidly progressing LAL-D who were treated with Kanuma demonstrated a substantial survival benefit to beyond 2 years of age. As we continue with our global disease education efforts, these data underscore the importance of early diagnosis of patients with LAL-D. We were also pleased in Q1 to receive marketing authorization for Kanuma in Japan and expect to serve initial patients in Japan in Q3.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding processes with health care authorities in other major European countries for both products. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of this year, with additional countries to follow in 2017. Strensiq and Kanuma have broad and strong labels, and we anticipate access to expand as a transformative clinical benefits for the small number of patients with HPP and LAL-D are recognized. Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In Q1, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 preclinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016. 
Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In urology, we expect to have data in refractory myasthenia gravis midyear. In kidney transplant, we expect data from our delayed graft function registration trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, our longer-acting C5 antibody that has a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5. 
We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving ALXN1210. In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed. We expect data to be presented midyear from our Phase I/II study and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating our clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical HUS later this year. 
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with our unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. This is a rare devastating disorder, characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
A the WORLDSymposium in March, the 6-month results for patients in the Phase I/II study showed continued improvements in the heparan sulfate, cerebral spinal fluid reduction with a mean reduction of 26% in the 3-milligram per kilogram dose. These 24-week results, coupled with the increased dose response observed in preclinical studies, support dose escalation for all patients in the study. We are now in the process of randomizing all patients to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has a potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration and look forward to updating you on the results from the dose escalation phase of the study.
The interim data for SBC-103 provide evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. 
I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls. We are excited about the multiple milestones and our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

And if you look back in the history, the -- these 2 quarters have a little bit of a -- leaving all these issues out of LatAm and more FX. We normally see a very flat quarters between Q4 to Q1 primarily because we see less number of days in Q1 compared to Q4. And it's -- and especially in Soliris, it tracks very closely to infusion days of the patients. And when you have less days, automatically, that also puts us into a spot. And as you know, that every year when you look at the holiday season from December to January, the infusion days do get one [ph] of the days up or down delayed. So that's why the reason of there's always very close to each other, that's what we see over the years. Now from that number, when you start seeing 2 issues are different this year is we have the revenue growth impact that we just talked about. And FX impact from Q4 to Q1, we had a negative FX impact of approximately $6 million. So if you put that in perspective, your numbers will totally tie up. Did I answer your question before we go..."

So regarding Strensiq, I think what we've seen is at least initially here, a strong addition of new patients that have commenced Strensiq treatment. And clearly, some of our early observations have been aided by the elements that Carsten covered. I think if you look at the geographic differences, what we at least see early on is that in Japan, given what has been characterized as a lethal mutation for HPP in the Japanese population, there is perhaps at least our early observations is there perhaps might be less of a prevalent pool just because patients have not had anything that they could rely on and most of the patients have deceased. But nonetheless, we are identifying in Japan clearly some children and even adults with pediatric onset HPP. But that might be one of the geographic differences that we've observed thus far. Between the U.S. and Germany, we see very similar dynamics in terms of the perinatal infantile and juvenile onset population, all of which are at different ages. And so we're going to continue to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. We're still going to be reaching out and looking to identify new patients quarter-over-quarter, and that is what the team has lined up and doing on a daily basis. Vikas?"

One is what's the top line impact and what is again the bottom line impact, right?

The view today we have is based on today's current exchange rates, we would -- that number would be much closer to $80 million impact for the year.

Definitely, we saw the advantage of $40 million of [indiscernible] coming in. That we have factored into the guidance. So the LatAm negative was compensated partially by this positive, right? Now when it comes to expenses, we have kind of a natural hedge. But when foreign currencies trend, then it goes the other way around that's why we talked about today, that being on the upper end of our guidance and hence, a very small impact will trickle down into the EPS. And that's why we guided, still keeping our guidance of $5 to $5.20 despite the Latin American weakness. Does that help?"

In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.",928,"Thank you, Elena. In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders. 
During the quarter, we achieved many commercial and R&D milestones. First, we grew our core Soliris business, largely driven by a steady number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Second, we progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries, with the strong addition of new patients. Third, we commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma and began to serve initial patients with LAL-D. And fourth, we advanced our robust rare disease pipeline, including exceeding target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed in 2 initial studies of ALXN1210 and patients with PNH; commencing the planned dose escalation for SBC-103. As 6-month data showed, the potential for an IV therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier for patients with MPS IIIB; and progressing 3 registration studies of eculizumab with MG data expected midyear, DGF data expected in the second half of 2016 and the NMO trial on track to complete enrollment this year. 
Looking at Soliris in Q1, we grew our core business by serving a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we've been operating the longest. This was offset by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin American countries, primarily in Brazil and Argentina. Despite the weakness in Latin America, we continue to see the majority of growth ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform.
Looking more closely at PNH in Q1, globally, we identified and served a high number of newly diagnosed patients by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the life-transforming benefits of Soliris to more patients in 2016 and beyond. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
In aHUS in Q1, we once again served a consistent number of new patients who presented with complement-mediated TMA. Matched for time now 18 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. And we continue to see the same trends in Europe, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our performance in Q1 as we served a growing number of new patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan, driven by our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. 
Also in the quarter, we continued to have success early in the launch in identifying both newly and previously diagnosed patients with HPP. As we continue to apply our expertise, we are confident that our work with the medical community will enable physicians to make a more rapid and accurate diagnosis and better informed treatment decisions for a growing number of patients with HPP over time. 
Now looking at Kanuma, we commenced the U.S. launch in early Q1 and are now making progress serving initial patients with LAL-D in both the U.S. and Germany. In order to reach more children with LAL-D faster, we are educating pediatric specialists and have enhanced our diagnostic pathway to aid patient identification and earlier treatment. 
While these improvements are leading to an increase in testing and appropriate patients, we are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of our target physicians. Throughout 2016, we look forward to serving an increasing number of new patients with HPP and LAL-D in the U.S., Germany and Japan while we progress our country-by-country funding processes throughout Europe. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call.
Looking ahead for the year, we have multiple R&D milestones, including several highlights from our ALXN1210 program, including: additional data in PNH and the initiation of an aHUS clinical program; data from the registration trials of eculizumab in MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; and continued development of SBC-103 with the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II study in MPS IIIB. We look forward to providing updates on our robust pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $701 million, a 24% increase in volume compared to the year-ago quarter. Our revenue was negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges in Q1 over the year-ago quarter. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, primarily due to increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, partially offset by early strength of the Strensiq launch and the strengthening of foreign currencies versus our previous expectations. We also expect 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the previously guided range of $5 to $5.20 per diluted share. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

Soliris revenues were $665 m",629,"Thanks, David. In Q1, total revenues increased to $701 million. This 17% revenue growth was driven by a 24% increase in volume, negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $665 million in Q1. While growth in our core territories remains strong, Soliris revenue growth was impacted mainly by 3 factors: increasing macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, resulting in an impact to new patient starts and treatment interruptions, primarily in Brazil and Argentina; currency headwinds; and our usual seasonality that we see every year as we move from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, Soliris volume growth was 18% and was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS.
Turning to our metabolic therapies. We are very pleased to report Strensiq revenues of $33 million, as we progress our initial launches in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In addition, we achieved Kanuma revenues of $2.5 million in our first quarter of the U.S. launch. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion in debt. In Q1, we purchased 2 million shares and have approximately $416 million remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility to support a long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes: investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches; advancing our robust pipeline; taking advantage of external opportunities; and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. Soliris revenues will be in the range of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion. While we continue to see growth in our core territories and expect to benefit from strengthening foreign currencies, we expect Soliris revenue growth in 2016 to continue to be negatively impacted by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America. 
At this point, we are expecting to see continued weakness in the region for the remainder of the year. Latin America accounts for approximately 10% of Soliris revenues. And our updated Soliris guidance reflects our forecast that approximately 20% to 30% of our Latin American revenues are at risk in 2016.
In addition, we are now forecasting total metabolic revenues to be above our previous expectations and are guiding to a range of $180 million to $200 million due to the early strength we are seeing in the Strensiq launch. 
Looking at our expenses, we are guiding to the high end of the range, primarily due to 3 factors: investing in key programs in our robust pipeline; advancing the global commercial launches of Strensiq and Kanuma; and the strengthening of foreign currencies. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $5 to $5.20. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q2 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $735 million to $745 million, which includes a $20 million to $25 million negative FX impact year-over-year. As a reminder, as in prior years, Q2 expenses will be higher than Q1. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.12 to $1.17.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and PNH and aHUS, by serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq and Kanuma and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

In Q1, our global commercial operations delivered 18% volume growth year-over-year for Soliris, progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with a strong addition of new patients and commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma.Starting",874,"Thank you, Vikas. In Q1, our global commercial operations delivered 18% volume growth year-over-year for Soliris, progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with a strong addition of new patients and commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma.
Starting with Soliris. We grew our core business, driven by a consistently high number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, offset by macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, impacting new patient starts and causing treatment interruptions in the region. Despite this weakness in Latin America, we are pleased with our progress on a global basis. 
In PNH in Q1, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. 
In aHUS, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we continue to expect that over time, our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS will be larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
During the quarter, we continued to identify a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform. And we continue to see the majority of our opportunity in both diseases in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to our initial country launches of our 2 highly innovative newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In the U.S., in Q1, we are very pleased with the early stages of launch. Our revenues in the quarter benefited from: identification of patients prior to approval; clinical trial patient transitions; and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. 
In Q2 and beyond, we will create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. And payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label. 
A growing body of medical evidence continues to enhance our understanding of HPP. Importantly, new longer-term data presented at ENDO this month showed sustained improvements in survival rates, bone healing, respiratory support and growth and mobility in children with HPP with ongoing Strensiq treatment. As the U.S. launch of Strensiq progresses, we are also applying key learnings to the other initial launch countries of Germany and Japan, where we're also serving patients with HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We commenced the launch in the U.S. in January and are now serving initial patients, as we apply our deep expertise in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. To support our launch, we are deploying disease education programs and more targeted diagnostic initiatives. These efforts are helping pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance for early diagnosis. 
This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years. With our diagnostic and disease education programs underway, we're observing both interest and receptivity and an increase in testing rates in children with liver and lipid abnormalities. We expect these programs directed at pediatric specialists to help accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time.
While our field teams are educating physicians to increase testing in appropriate patients, we continue to accelerate our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to drive more testing with a greater number of our target physicians. 
Our efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the WORLDSymposium meeting in March, new 2-year data in infants with rapidly progressing LAL-D who were treated with Kanuma demonstrated a substantial survival benefit to beyond 2 years of age. As we continue with our global disease education efforts, these data underscore the importance of early diagnosis of patients with LAL-D. We were also pleased in Q1 to receive marketing authorization for Kanuma in Japan and expect to serve initial patients in Japan in Q3.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding processes with health care authorities in other major European countries for both products. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of this year, with additional countries to follow in 2017. Strensiq and Kanuma have broad and strong labels, and we anticipate access to expand as the transformative clinical benefits for the small number of patients with HPP and LAL-D are recognized. Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In Q1, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 preclinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016. 
Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In urology, we expect to have data in refractory myasthenia gravis midyear. In kidney transplant, we expect data from our delayed graft function registration trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, our longer-acting C5 antibody that has a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5. 
We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving ALXN1210. In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed. We expect data to be presented midyear from our Phase I/II study and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical HUS later this year. 
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with our unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. This is a rare devastating disorder, characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
A the WORLDSymposium in March, the 6-month results for patients in the Phase I/II study showed continued improvements in the heparan sulfate, cerebral spinal fluid reduction with a mean reduction of 26% in the 3-milligram per kilogram dose. These 24-week results, coupled with the increased dose response observed in preclinical studies, support dose escalation for all patients in the study. We are now in the process of randomizing all patients to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has a potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration and look forward to updating you on the results from the dose escalation phase of the study.
The interim data for SBC-103 provide evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. 
I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls. We are excited about the multiple milestones and our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

So Soliris on that, if I take just Soliris and not do the new drugs, then it will probably be around 18%, 19% levels on a volume growth."

And to the best of our knowledge today, what we have done is looked at the risk profile, with taking no patient additions there and taking some business interruption in the existing patients, treatment interruption to existing patients and taken a view that out of the 10% total sales that we have exposed towards Latin America, 20% to 30% of that sales or 2% to 3% of our total global sales will be exposed there.

I've addressed this in the past, and of course, as you said, it is well before even seeing data and whether or not we have a package for submission.

And so given the fact that MG is different than -- we're looking at a patient population in an ultrarare disease range. But as you say, sort of the efforts to identify the patients are different here. And so I think that one could conclude the dynamics might be perhaps a little bit different than what we've experienced with PNH, aHUS and here in the early days of HPP and LAL-D.

And the other one is to look at sequentially. I think there's a lot of confusion here. When you look at year-over-year, what we're seeing here is, the numbers what you're quoting is absolutely right, right? So year-over-year, we're going to have a 2% to 3% revenue growth getting impacted by the Latin American new patients nonstarts and treatment interruptions. So that's where we feel that the growth is getting hurt, right, on the volume side. You're absolutely right on that. And when we try to analyze that going into the full year, it's like 20 times 40 right? So that you get to like $60 million to $90 million range, which is absolutely correct. Where I think there's some confusion, I feel -- I'm just kind of feeling here is going from Q4 to Q1. And if you look back in the history, the -- these 2 quarters have a little bit of a -- leaving all these issues out of LATAM or FX, we normally see very flat quarters between Q4 to Q1, primarily because we see less number of days in Q1 compared to Q4. And it's -- and especially in Soliris, it tracks very closely to infusion days of the patients. And when you have less days, automatically, that also puts into a spot. And as you know that every year when you look at the holiday season from December to January, the infusion days do get 1, 2 days up or down delayed. So that's why the reason of -- there's always very close to each other, that's what we see over the years. Now from that number, when you start seeing 2 issues are different this year is we had the revenue growth impact that we just talked about. And FX impact from Q4 to Q1, we had a negative FX impact of approximately $6 million. So if you put that in perspective, your numbers will totally tie up. Did I answer your question?

So regarding Strensiq, I think what we've seen is at least initially here, a strong addition of new patients that have commenced Strensiq treatment. And clearly, some of our early observations have been aided by the elements that Carsten covered. I think if you look at the geographic differences, what we at least see early on is that in Japan, given what has been characterized as a lethal mutation for HPP in the Japanese population, there is perhaps -- at least our early observations is there perhaps might be less of a prevalent pool just because patients have not had anything that they could rely on and most of the patients have deceased. But nonetheless, we are identifying in Japan clearly some children and even adults with pediatric onset HPP. But that might be one of the geographic differences that we've observed thus far. Between the U.S. and Germany, we see very similar dynamics in terms of the perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset population, all of which are at different ages. And so we're going to continue to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. We're still going to be reaching out and looking to identify new patients quarter-over-quarter, and that is what the team has lined up and doing on a daily basis. Vikas?"

One is what's the top line impact and what is again the bottom line impact, right? On the top line front, as we had previously guided, $120 million would be the impact going from 2015 to 2016 in our FX because we're hedged 50% of the stock. The view today we have is based on today's current exchange rates, we would -- that number would be much closer to $80 million impact for the year. So we see -- we saw $30 million already included in Q1 2015 over '16. Q2, we are guiding more closer to $20 million, $25 million levels, and the remainder will be towards the second half. Definitely, we saw the advantage of $40 million approx coming in. That we have factored into the guidance. So the LATAM negative was compensated partially by this positive, right? Now when it comes to expenses, we have kind of a natural hedge. But when foreign currencies trend, then it goes the other way around. That's why we talked about today, that being on the upper end of our guidance and hence, a very small impact will trickle down into the EPS. And that's why we guided, still keeping our guidance of $5 to $5.20 despite the Latin American weakness. Does that help?"

In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.",928,"Thank you, Elena. In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders. 
During the quarter, we achieved many commercial and R&D milestones. First, we grew our core Soliris business, largely driven by a steady number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Second, we progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries, with the strong addition of new patients. Third, we commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma and began to serve initial patients with LAL-D. And fourth, we advanced our robust rare disease pipeline, including exceeding target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed in 2 initial studies of ALXN1210 and patients with PNH; commencing the planned dose escalation for SBC-103. As 6-month data showed, the potential for an IV therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier for patients with MPS IIIB; and progressing 3 registration studies of eculizumab with MG data expected midyear, DGF data expected in the second half of 2016 and the NMO trial on track to complete enrollment this year. 
Looking at Soliris in Q1, we grew our core business by serving a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we've been operating the longest. This was offset by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin American countries, primarily in Brazil and Argentina. Despite the weakness in Latin America, we continue to see the majority of growth ahead of us for both PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform.
Looking more closely at PNH in Q1, globally, we identified and served a high number of newly diagnosed patients by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the life-transforming benefits of Soliris to more patients in 2016 and beyond. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
In aHUS in Q1, we once again served a consistent number of new patients who presented with complement-mediated TMA. Matched for time now 18 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. And we continue to see the same trends in Europe, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our performance in Q1 as we served a growing number of new patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan, driven by our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. 
Also in the quarter, we continued to have success early in the launch in identifying both newly and previously diagnosed patients with HPP. As we continue to apply our expertise, we are confident that our work with the medical community will enable physicians to make a more rapid and accurate diagnosis and better informed treatment decisions for a growing number of patients with HPP over time. 
Now looking at Kanuma, we commenced the U.S. launch in early Q1 and are now making progress serving initial patients with LAL-D in both the U.S. and Germany. In order to reach more children with LAL-D faster, we are educating pediatric specialists and have enhanced our diagnostic pathway to aid patient identification and earlier treatment. 
While these improvements are leading to an increase in testing and appropriate patients, we are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of our target physicians. Throughout 2016, we look forward to serving an increasing number of new patients with HPP and LAL-D in the U.S., Germany and Japan while we progress our country-by-country funding processes throughout Europe. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call.
Looking ahead for the year, we have multiple R&D milestones, including several highlights from our ALXN1210 program, including: additional data in PNH and the initiation of an aHUS clinical program; data from the registration trials of eculizumab in MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; and continued development of SBC-103 with the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II study in MPS IIIB. We look forward to providing updates on our robust pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $701 million, a 24% increase in volume compared to the year-ago quarter. Our revenue was negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges in Q1 over the year-ago quarter. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, primarily due to increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, partially offset by early strength of the Strensiq launch and the strengthening of foreign currencies versus our previous expectations. We also expect 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the previously guided range of $5 to $5.20 per diluted share. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

Soliris revenues were $665 million in Q1. While growth in our core territories remains strong, Soliris revenue growth was impacted mainly by 3 factors: increasing macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, resulting in an impact to new patient starts and treatment interruptions, primarily in Brazil and Argentina; currency headwinds; and our usual seasonality that we see every year as we move from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, Soliris volume growth was 18% and was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS.
Turning to our metabolic therapies. We are very pleased to report Strensiq revenues of $33 million, as we progress our initial launches in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In addition, we achieved Kanuma revenues of $2.5 million in our first quarter of the U.S. launch. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion in debt. In Q1, we purchased 2 million shares and have approximately $416 million remaining in our share repurchase program. 
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility to support a long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes: investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches; advancing our robust pipeline; taking advantage of external opportunities; and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. Soliris revenues will be in the range of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion. While we continue to see growth in our core territories and expect to benefit from strengthening foreign currencies, we expect Soliris revenue growth in 2016 to continue to be negatively impacted by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America. 
At this point, we are expecting to see continued weakness in the region for the remainder of the year. Latin America accounts for approximately 10% of Soliris revenues. And our updated Soliris guidance reflects our forecast that approximately 20% to 30% of our Latin American revenues are at risk in 2016.
In addition, we are now forecasting total metabolic revenues to be above our previous expectations and are guiding to a range of $180 million to $200 million due to the early strength we are seeing in the Strensiq launch. 
Looking at our expenses, we are guiding to the high end of the range, primarily due to 3 factors: investing in key programs in our robust pipeline; advancing the global commercial launches of Strensiq and Kanuma; and the strengthening of foreign currencies. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $5 to $5.20. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q2 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $735 million to $745 million, which includes a $20 million to $25 million negative FX impact year-over-year. As a reminder, as in prior years, Q2 expenses will be higher than Q1. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.12 to $1.17.
Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS, driven by the continued growth of Soliris and PNH and aHUS, by serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq and Kanuma and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

In Q1, our global commercial operations delivered 18% volume growth year-over-year for Soliris, progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with a strong addition of new patients and commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma.Starting",874,"Thank you, Vikas. In Q1, our global commercial operations delivered 18% volume growth year-over-year for Soliris, progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with a strong addition of new patients and commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma.
Starting with Soliris. We grew our core business, driven by a consistently high number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, offset by macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, impacting new patient starts and causing treatment interruptions in the region. Despite this weakness in Latin America, we are pleased with our progress on a global basis. 
In PNH in Q1, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. 
In aHUS, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we continue to expect that over time, our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS will be larger than that of PNH. 
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. 
During the quarter, we continued to identify a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform. And we continue to see the majority of our opportunity in both diseases in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to our initial country launches of our 2 highly innovative newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In the U.S., in Q1, we are very pleased with the early stages of launch. Our revenues in the quarter benefited from: identification of patients prior to approval; clinical trial patient transitions; and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. 
In Q2 and beyond, we will create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. And payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label. 
A growing body of medical evidence continues to enhance our understanding of HPP. Importantly, new longer-term data presented at ENDO this month showed sustained improvements in survival rates, bone healing, respiratory support and growth and mobility in children with HPP with ongoing Strensiq treatment. As the U.S. launch of Strensiq progresses, we are also applying key learnings to the other initial launch countries of Germany and Japan, where we're also serving patients with HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We commenced the launch in the U.S. in January and are now serving initial patients, as we apply our deep expertise in ultrarare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. To support our launch, we are deploying disease education programs and more targeted diagnostic initiatives. These efforts are helping pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance for early diagnosis. 
This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years. With our diagnostic and disease education programs underway, we're observing both interest and receptivity and an increase in testing rates in children with liver and lipid abnormalities. We expect these programs directed at pediatric specialists to help accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time.
While our field teams are educating physicians to increase testing in appropriate patients, we continue to accelerate our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to drive more testing with a greater number of our target physicians. 
Our efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the WORLDSymposium meeting in March, new 2-year data in infants with rapidly progressing LAL-D who were treated with Kanuma demonstrated a substantial survival benefit to beyond 2 years of age. As we continue with our global disease education efforts, these data underscore the importance of early diagnosis of patients with LAL-D. We were also pleased in Q1 to receive marketing authorization for Kanuma in Japan and expect to serve initial patients in Japan in Q3.
Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding processes with health care authorities in other major European countries for both products. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of this year, with additional countries to follow in 2017. Strensiq and Kanuma have broad and strong labels, and we anticipate access to expand as the transformative clinical benefits for the small number of patients with HPP and LAL-D are recognized. Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In Q1, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 preclinical programs with at least 4 moving into the clinic in 2016. 
Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In urology, we expect to have data in refractory myasthenia gravis midyear. In kidney transplant, we expect data from our delayed graft function registration trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year. 
In addition to Soliris, we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, our longer-acting C5 antibody that has a half-life nearly 3x that of Soliris has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5. 
We have 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving ALXN1210. In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed. We expect data to be presented midyear from our Phase I/II study and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical HUS later this year. 
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease. In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rates of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with our unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. This is a rare devastating disorder, characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. 
At the WORLDSymposium in March, the 6-month results for patients in the Phase I/II study showed continued improvements in the heparan sulfate, cerebral spinal fluid reduction with a mean reduction of 26% in the 3-milligram per kilogram dose. These 24-week results, coupled with the increased dose response observed in preclinical studies, support dose escalation for all patients in the study. We are now in the process of randomizing all patients to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has a potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood-brain barrier penetration and look forward to updating you on the results from the dose escalation phase of the study.
The interim data for SBC-103 provide evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. 
I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls. We are excited about the multiple milestones and our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

I've addressed this in the past, and of course, as you said, it is well before even seeing data and whether or not we have a package for submission. But nonetheless, I do think the dynamics are slightly different. MG, in general, is a more common disease, and we are targeting the most severely affected patients in which no unapproved support of care that is being used is making any meaningful improvements in the patients, and those were the ones that we enrolled in our trial. And so given the fact that MG is different than -- we're looking at a patient population in an ultrarare disease range. But as you say, sort of the efforts to identify the patients are different here. And so I think that one could conclude the dynamics might be perhaps a little bit different than what we've experienced with PNH, aHUS and here in the early days of HPP and LAL-D. Nonetheless, still a small patient population affected by an extremely severe and devastating disease. And we will see. But of course, as you said, what's most important is we've got to see the data."

And the other one is to look at sequentially. I think there's a lot of confusion here. When you look at year-over-year, what we're seeing here is, the numbers what you're quoting is absolutely right, right? So year-over-year, we're going to have a 2% to 3% revenue growth getting impacted by the Latin American new patients nonstarts and treatment interruptions. So that's where we feel that the growth is getting hurt, right, on the volume side. You're absolutely right on that. And when we try to analyze that going into the full year, it's like 20 times 40 right? So that you get to like $60 million to $90 million range, which is absolutely correct. Where I think there's some confusion, I feel -- I'm just kind of feeling here is going from Q4 to Q1. And if you look back in the history, the -- these 2 quarters have a little bit of a -- leaving all these issues out of LATAM or FX, we normally see very flat quarters between Q4 to Q1, primarily because we see less number of days in Q1 compared to Q4. And it's -- and especially in Soliris, it tracks very closely to infusion days of the patients. And when you have less days, automatically, that also puts into a spot. And as you know that every year when you look at the holiday season from December to January, the infusion days do get 1, 2 days up or down delayed. So that's why the reason of -- there's always very close to each other, that's what we see over the years. Now from that number, when you start seeing 2 issues are different this year is we had the revenue growth impact that we just talked about. And FX impact from Q4 to Q1, we had a negative FX impact of approximately $6 million. So if you put that in perspective, your numbers will totally tie up. Did I answer your question?

And clearly, some of our early observations have been aided by the elements that Carsten covered. I think if you look at the geographic differences, what we at least see early on is that in Japan, given what has been characterized as a lethal mutation for HPP in the Japanese population, there is perhaps -- at least our early observations is there perhaps might be less of a prevalent pool just because patients have not had anything that they could rely on and most of the patients have deceased. But nonetheless, we are identifying in Japan clearly some children and even adults with pediatric onset HPP. But that might be one of the geographic differences that we've observed thus far. Between the U.S. and Germany, we see very similar dynamics in terms of the perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset population, all of which are at different ages. And so we're going to continue to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives.

One is what's the top line impact and what is again the bottom line impact, right? On the top line front, as we had previously guided, $120 million would be the impact going from 2015 to 2016 in our FX because we're hedged 50% of the stock. The view today we have is based on today's current exchange rates, we would -- that number would be much closer to $80 million impact for the year. So we see -- we saw $30 million already included in Q1 2015 over '16. Q2, we are guiding more closer to $20 million, $25 million levels, and the remainder will be towards the second half. Definitely, we saw the advantage of $40 million approx coming in. That we have factored into the guidance. So the LATAM negative was compensated partially by this positive, right? Now when it comes to expenses, we have kind of a natural hedge. But when foreign currencies trend, then it goes the other way around. That's why we talked about today, that being on the upper end of our guidance and hence, a very small impact will trickle down into the EPS.

In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases, as we continue to provide life transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders. As our commercial team reached more patients during th",1330,"Thank you, Elena. In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases, as we continue to provide life transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders. 
As our commercial team reached more patients during the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth and improved our operating margins, while also progressing our robust R&D pipeline.
Our commercial organization delivered totaled year-over-year revenue growth of 18% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris, continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS, being treated globally; second, Strensiq, in only its third quarter of launch, is a new driver of growth; and third, Kanuma, continued to progress since we launched in the U.S. last quarter, with newly identified patients, starting on treatment.
In Q2, there were several highlights in our rare disease pipeline. The presentation of our Phase III REGAIN study, where we believe the strength of the data from the predefined endpoints and prospective analysis support the potential of eculizumab to provide an early sustained and substantial response in patients with refractory MG. These results will enable us to have constructive discussions with regulators, despite the narrow primary endpoint miss.
The presentation of Phase I/II data of monthly dosing of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH, the presentation of Phase I/II data of SBC 103 showing the potential for dose depended disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB, and the progress of our Phase III studies of eculizumab in DGF and NMO.
Now for a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris and PNH. In Q2, we continued to identify and serve the consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients globally, by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients.
Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH, on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform, affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
Moving to Soliris and aHUS. We once, again, served a consistently high number of new patients globally. We see a significant opportunity ahead to serve more patients, recognizing that a high number of patients with aHUS presenting with severe and rapidly progressing renal failure still do not receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Match for time now, 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., they are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with the improvements we continued to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that this trend of new patient additions will continue, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward, the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS, gives us great confidence that the majority of growth in our core Soliris business is ahead of us.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2, as we served an increasing number of patients with HPP, both children as well as adults with pediatric-onset disease. Our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives have been underway for more than 3 years, and will continue to help us identify and serve more patients with Strensiq over time. By leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases, just 3 quarters into the launch, Strensiq now represents a new driver of growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S., which started in Q1. We are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of target physicians and accounts in order to reach more patients with LAL-D faster.
Like HPP, we are now deploying a specialty diagnostic team and are seeing early signs that our enhanced diagnostic pathway is leading to an increase in testing. We expect that these efforts will accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAL-D over time.
Moving on to R&D. We are leveraging our unique rare disease development capabilities to advance our highly innovative pipeline to drive additional growth. We have established our leadership and complement biology over the past 20 years, which gives us great conviction that our compliment portfolio will enable us to serve an increasing number of patients.
Soliris remains in a position of strength, with strong IP as well as regulatory data and orphan drug exclusivities in our core territories, extending through the end of this decade, and we expect well into next.
Building upon Soliris, one of our commitments and top priorities is to bring even higher levels of innovation to patients and physicians. Our R&D team is developing 8 complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer acting C5 antibody currently in 2 Phase II trials in patients with PNH. New Phase I/II data, presented this quarter, showed that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing had rapid and sustained reductions in LDH.
We are also evaluating ALXN1210 in longer dosing intervals, and look forward to serving more patients with Soliris, ALXN1210 and our growing complement portfolio into the next decade and beyond.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, we will have multiple R&D milestones, including an update on our progress with regulators for eculizumab and refractory MG, data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab and DGF, completion of enrollment in the Phase III NMO trial, and additional ALXN1210 data in patients with PNH.
Beyond our compliment portfolio, we continue to develop other highly innovative therapies. And in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. Martin will take a closer look at our pipeline later on the call.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $753 million, an increase of 18% over Q2 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early progress of our Kanuma launch in the U.S.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter. I also want to briefly touch on the SEC's interpretation on GAAP financial measures issued in May.
We have modified our definition of our non-GAAP income tax expense to align with this recently issued interpretation. It is important to note that this modification will not change the amount of cash taxes we pay in 2016, or in the future, or have any impact on our cash flow.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 reduction per share attributable entirely to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Prior to this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. And based on the strength of the Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million.
In addition, based on the change in our non-GAAP tax rate, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. As we did in Q2, we will accelerate EPS in 2016 and beyond, driven by continued growth of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma and operating expense discipline, which will expand our operating margins from 48% to 49% in 2018.
At this point, I'll turn the floor over to Vikas, for a closer look in our financial performance. Vikas?"

In Q2, we delivered strong financial performance, while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Total revenues increased to $753 million. Our business grew year-over-year by 18%, with volume growth of 23%. Currency headwinds negatively impacted Q2 revenues by 3%, or $18 million compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $701 million. Year-over-year volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS. While the macroeconomic weakness in Latin America continues, the guidance we provided in April remains on track for the remainder of the year.
Turning to Strensiq, after only 3 quarters, our strong launch in driving new growth and we reported revenues of $45 million. Looking at Kanuma, in just the second quarter since launch, we achieved revenues of $6 million, driven by our continued progress in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter. Turning to taxes, we previously defined our non-GAAP income tax expense as being equal to the amount of cash, income taxes paid or accrued on our current year performance. However, to align with the SEC interpretations on non-GAAP financial measures, issued on May 17, which apply to U.S. public companies, we have modified our definition of non-GAAP tax expense. The modified definition no longer includes the cash tax benefits we realized during the year from NOLs and income tax credits, and now includes other deferred taxes.
It is important to note that this will not change the amount of cash taxes we will pay or have any impact on our cash flow. We ended last year with NOLs and tax credits that have a cash value of approximately $600 million. We are reporting a non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 16% for Q2.
As you can see on Slide 9, and the supplemental tax information tables in our press release, we are providing updated full-year guidance of 15.5% to 16.5%. We have updated our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate to assist in your year-over-year comparisons. Long term, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of 13% to 15% in 2019 and beyond, versus our prior year guidance -- previous guidance of 12% to 14%. This small change is a result of noncash deferred taxes.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 per share reduction, attributable to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Without this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning to other elements of our 2016 guidance, I would like to highlight a few key points. First, we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance; second, based on the strength of Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million; third, we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year of 2016; and fourth, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. The change in our non-GAAP EPS guidance is entirely attributable to the change in non-GAAP tax rate.  For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q3 guidance, revenues are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million, including currency headwinds of approximately $17 million to $20 million year-over-year. We expect R&D expenses for the second half of the year will increase due to the timing of expenses and our continued investment in our pipeline.
For Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $1.14 to $1.18 per share. Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have purchased 3.8 million shares and have approximately $425 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches, prioritizing investments in our robust pipeline; taking advantage of external opportunities that fit our strategic and financial goals; and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten, for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

Starting with Soliris. In Q2, we grew our global business through the continued strong addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, resulting in 15% Soliris volume growth year-over-year, despite ongoing headwinds in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH, in Q2, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, even in the territories where we have been operating the longest. And we continue to see that the majority of patients, starting on Soliris, are also newly diagnosed.
Since 2007, we have identified a similar number of new patients on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform, affirming our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, where we have been serving patients for nearly 5 years, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH.
And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is langer than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, who are in urgent need of treatment, we continue to focus on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TAM tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris, as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS.
During the quarter, we identified a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS on a global basis, and we continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and aHUS in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to the launches of our two highly innovative, newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In Q2, we delivered another strong quarter of new patients initiating therapy. Our revenues benefited from the combination of the identification of patients prior to approval, newly identified patients in the quarter and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focus on the mobilities and high mortality of HPP. We're leveraging the strong labels, which include substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise in the early phases of launch, we will continue to create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP.
Today, physicians are increasingly recognition the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme.
As the robust U.S. launch of Strensiq advances, were applying key learnings to Germany and Japan where we are in the early stages of serving patients with HPP. As we look to expand our launch to new countries, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR II rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP. As in France, we expect to continue to progress additional in-country funding processes for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continue to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We're applying our successful experience with Soliris and our accelerating disease education programs and targeted diagnostic initiatives to help pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance of early diagnosis. This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years.
Our LAL-D efforts are aided by our enhanced diagnostic pathway as we educate pediatric specialists on the signs and symptoms of the disease, and the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis to support patient identification and earlier treatment.
Like with HPP, we are deploying a specialty diagnostic team for LAL-D and are starting to see increased dried blood spot testing of patients with liver and lipid abnormalities, as well as more physicians now adding LAL-D to their routine diagnostic workup.
In addition, we are now targeting the largest U.S. pediatric centers to implement our diagnostic pathway. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., I'd like to note that the majority of Kanuma clinical trial patients were enrolled outside of the U.S, and remain in the extension trial. We expect to begin to transition these clinical trial patients onto commercial product towards the end of 2016 and into 2017 as we progress the in-country funding processes.
As we look to the second half of this year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris in PNH and aHUS, built on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP, and apply our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to identify more patients with a LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma. 
Now, I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

In Q2, we continued to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with eculizumab and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, despite the narrow miss on the primary endpoint in the Phase III REGAIN study, I would like to highlight 3 key points. First, we believe the totality and consistency of data supports the potential of eculizumab to provide an early, sustained and substantial response in patients with this devastating complement mediated disease. 
Second, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, our GP values less than 0.05, underscoring the pivotal role of compliment inhibition in addressing the underlying cause of disease.
And third, we are in the process of engaging with regulators in the U.S. and Europe to work together to address the urgent need for patients with refractory GMG, who are suffering from debilitating muscle weakness and currently have no effective treatment. We expect to have an update by the end of the year.
Our ongoing Phase III trials with eculizumab and delayed-graft function and spectrum disorder are progressing as planned. We continued to expect data from our DGF Phase III trial in the second half of this year, and we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing NMO SDC3 trial this year.
Building our strong foundation with Soliris, we are developing 8 additional innovative complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer acting C5 antibody that, like Soliris, leverages the only proven modality for safe, rapid, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
We are advancing our clinical program for ALXN1210 with two ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH. In these two studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with nearly 40 patients receiving ALXN1210.
Last month, new data from 13 patients in the Phase I/II study, presented at the European Hematology Association Congress, show that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing exhibited rapid reductions in LDH, which were sustained for up to 5 monthly dosing intervals of the ALXN1210. 
Researchers also reported that, at the time of the analysis, 80% of patients who required at least one blood transfusion in the 12 months prior to treatment with ALXN1210, did not require transfusions while on treatment. This interim data suggests that rapid, complete and sustained complement inhibition with the ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of complement [indiscernible] and monthly dosing intervals.
We expect additional PNH data to be presented by the end of the year and continues to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical aHUS later this year.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting compliment protein C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. New interim data from 13 patients, presented at EHA, showed a high overall response rate at day 28 and day 56 in 77% of patients treated with ALXN1007. Complete GI-GVHD response rates at day 28 and 56 were 69% and 77%, respectively. This data continued to support the investment of ALXN1007, where we are now evaluating higher doses in patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency, or MOC the Type A, are rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We are enrolling patients in a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1007 in neonates with MoCD type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.
We also completed a study to characterize the natural history of MoCD type A this quarter. Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the [indiscernible] , versus administered intravenously with patients with [indiscernible] IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder, with no available treatment. Children suffering from the disease experience severe neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. New data from our ongoing Phase I/II trial, represented earlier this month, and preliminary evidence based on MRI and neurocognitive assessments at 6 months, showed the potential for dose dependent disease stabilization, in patients with MPS IIIB. We have completed the planned dose escalation with all patients now randomized to either a 5-milligram per kilogram, or 10 milligram per kilogram dose. 
Additional SBC-103 data expected in the process of 2017. The interim data for SBC-103 administered IV, provide evidence that our unique and proprietary [indiscernible] platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for our patients.
We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS mobilities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focus on progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
I will now turn the call back over to David. David?"

As Martin and I both discussed during the call, we saw monthly dosing, 100% of patients had an outstanding response to 1210. We've also been indicating for quite some time that that's obviously, 2x the interval of where we stand today with eculizumab, and what we would be looking to do is if test longer intervals. Now without commenting on precisely whether or not its quarterly, what we'd like to do, obviously, is have data that we would all be sharing with you that you could then better understand what that dosing interval might be as we continue to progress the development program for 1210. And we look forward to updating you on this later towards the end of the year. As it relates to the impact of 1210, as opposed to eculizumab, I just state that the only attribute that we have really focused on is interval. And we do think that in, on of itself, depending upon whether it's monthly or longer, makes a meaningful difference across our 50-country operating platform. We are serving patients on an ongoing basis in countries where, and even in this country, where access to treatment can be improved, and we would expect that, that would help us to meet the needs of more physicians and patients, and reach out and even improve our ability to treat more patients. But on top of that, with our pivotal programs that we are anticipating, we clearly will always look to provide as much information to patients as possible, both with those interval and potentially with other clinical benefits to those patients as we optimize a highly innovative molecule."

But I think all of the attributes from the interval, the optionality and the other clinical benefits, will help us to inform what Carsten and his team's go-to-market strategy will be for 1210."

And again, you heard David and I both mentioning we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing at various stages. And as part of that development, but we really very cognizant of our experience with Soliris, an antibody, and the attributes of that highly innovative therapy, and I'll just give you a few examples of things that we think about, and then that relates directly to your question about really the potential for other modalities, you know, the detailed knowledge of the physical chemistry of C5 blockade in patients. And we built this up over many years. The need, and we know about this to get immediate complete and sustained reduction of C5 activity, greater than 99%, regardless of source. We also think about the pathways involved, and very effective terminal complement blockade of all 3 pathways, whether it'd be alternative, classical or lifetime. A really important one, as you may imagine from this pathway, just Soliris leads important immune response activity intact, so another thing that you need to think about deeply as you develop other molecules. Again, with the antibody, no identified off target effects, again, a critical part of developing any medicine. And of course, with Soliris proven long-term safety and efficacy for over 15 years now, since the first PNH patient was dosed, so you put all that together, Geoff, it's an incredible hard dose Soliris really terrific molecule. That said, and again as David alluded to, we think about ALXN1210 to be able to give these treatment options to patients. And then, of course, our other complement inhibitors that will speak more about in due course."

And so the point about perhaps others coming into the market to recruit patients, that may be something that answer to leave the take any one of these matters very, very seriously, but we have a unique perspective on exactly where the patients are, the physicians were managing them and unique capability to develop complement inhibitors, and that's how we are able to enroll nearly 40 patients so quickly. And we look to apply that, obviously, into our pivotal program as well as aHUS. Now one of the things that we'll be thoughtful about, after the 2018 time frame, is the impact of competitor trials. But I also come back to one of the earlier questions about how do we see 1210 and Soliris coexisting? What we know in our global operating platform is that we can reach many, many more patients with PNH and aHUS and we are less than some of them do not receive the treatment because in every week visit to whether where they are, and in many cases, large, high reimbursable population developing nations where the physician or the patient may be uncomfortable with that every other week visit to an infusion center, and so we are also expecting with Soliris and the advance of something that will be driving to even higher volume levels and I would also just remind you as we discussed today, we still see an extremely high proportion of PNH patients that are not yet diagnosed and/or treated and aHUS is largely an incident market, so that's, and Carsten and I have indicated, we're still not reaching a very large proportion of the aHUS patients.

In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases as we continue to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.
As our commercial team reached more patients during the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth and improved our operating margins, while also progressing our robust R&D pipeline.
Our commercial organization delivered totaled year-over-year revenue growth of 18% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS being treated globally. Second, Strensiq, in only its third quarter of launch, is a new driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continued to progress since we've launched in the U.S. last quarter with newly identified patients starting on treatment.
In Q2, there were several highlights in our rare disease pipeline. The presentation of our Phase III REGAIN study, where we believe the strength of the data from the predefined endpoints and prospective analysis support the potential of eculizumab to provide an early sustained and substantial response in patients with refractory MG. These results will enable us to have constructive discussions with regulators, despite the narrow primary endpoint miss.
The presentation of Phase I/II data of monthly dosing of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH, the presentation of Phase I/II data of SBC-103 showing the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB, and the progress of our Phase III studies of eculizumab in DGF and NMO.
Now for a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris and PNH. In Q2, we continued to identify and serve the consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients globally by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients.
Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
Moving to Soliris and aHUS. We once again served a consistently high number of new patients globally. We see a significant opportunity ahead to serve more patients, recognizing that a high number of patients with aHUS presenting with severe and rapidly progressing renal failure still do not receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with the improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that this trend of new patient additions will continue, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward, the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS gives us great confidence that the majority of growth in our core Soliris business is ahead of us.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 as we served an increasing number of patients with HPP, both children as well as adults with pediatric-onset disease. Our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives have been underway for more than 3 years and will continue to help us identify and serve more patients with Strensiq over time. By leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases, just 3 quarters into the launch, Strensiq now represents a new driver of growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S., which started in Q1. We are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of target physicians and accounts in order to reach more patients with LAL-D faster.
Like HPP, we are now deploying a specialty diagnostic team and are seeing early signs that our enhanced diagnostic pathway is leading to an increase in testing. We expect that these efforts will accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAL-D over time.
Moving on to R&D. We are leveraging our unique rare disease development capabilities to advance our highly innovative pipeline to drive additional growth. We have established our leadership and complement biology over the past 20 years, which gives us great conviction that our complement portfolio will enable us to serve an increasing number of patients.
Soliris remains in a position of strength with strong IP as well as regulatory data and orphan drug exclusivities in our core territories, extending through the end of this decade, and we expect well into next.
Building upon Soliris, one of our commitments and top priorities is to bring even higher levels of innovation to patients and physicians. Our R&D team is developing 8 complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody currently in 2 Phase II trials in patients with PNH. New Phase I/II data presented this quarter showed that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing had rapid and sustained reductions in LDH.
We are also evaluating ALXN1210 in longer dosing intervals and look forward to serving more patients with Soliris, ALXN1210 and our growing complement portfolio into the next decade and beyond.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016. We will have multiple R&D milestones, including an update on our progress with regulators for eculizumab and refractory MG, data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab and DGF, completion of enrollment in the Phase III NMO trial and additional ALXN1210 data in patients with PNH.
Beyond our complement portfolio, we continue to develop other highly innovative therapies. And in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. Martin will take a closer look at our pipeline later on the call.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter. We achieved total revenues of $753 million, an increase of 18% over Q2 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early progress of our Kanuma launch in the U.S. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
I also want to briefly touch on the SEC's interpretation on GAAP financial measures issued in May. We have modified our definition of our non-GAAP income tax expense to align with this recently issued interpretation. It is important to note that this modification will not change the amount of cash taxes we pay in 2016 or in the future or have any impact on our cash flow.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 reduction per share attributable entirely to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Prior to this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. And based on the strength of the Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million.
In addition, based on the change in our non-GAAP tax rate, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. As we did in Q2, we will accelerate EPS in 2016 and beyond, driven by continued growth of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma and operating expense discipline, which will expand our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look in our financial performance. Vikas?"

In Q2, we delivered strong financial performance while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Total revenues increased to $753 million. Our business grew year-over-year by 18%, with volume growth of 23%. Currency headwinds negatively impacted Q2 revenues by 3% or $18 million compared to the year ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $701 million. Year-over-year volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS. While macroeconomic weakness in Latin America continues, the guidance we provided in April remains on track for the remainder of the year.
Turning to Strensiq. After only 3 quarters, a strong launch in driving new growth, and we reported revenues of $45 million. Looking at Kanuma, in just the second quarter since launch, we achieved revenues of $6 million, driven by our continued progress in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
Turning to taxes, we previously defined our non-GAAP income tax expense as being equal to the amount of cash income taxes paid or accrued on our current year performance. However, to align with the SEC interpretations on non-GAAP financial measures issued on May 17, which apply to U.S. public companies, we have modified our definition of non-GAAP tax expense. The modified definition no longer includes the cash tax benefits we've realized during the year from NOLs and income tax credits and now includes other deferred taxes.
It is important to note that this will not change the amount of cash taxes we will pay or have any impact on our cash flow. We ended last year with NOLs and tax credits that have a cash value of approximately $600 million. We are reporting a non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 16% for Q2.
As you can see on Slide 9 and the supplemental tax information tables in our press release, we are providing updated full year guidance of 15.5% to 16.5%. We have updated our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate to assist in your year-over-year comparisons. Long term, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of 13% to 15% in 2019 and beyond versus our prior year guidance -- previous guidance of 12% to 14%. This small change is a result of noncash deferred taxes.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 per share reduction attributable to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Without this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning to other elements of our 2016 guidance. I would like to highlight a few key points. First, we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. Second, based on the strength of Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million. Third, we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year of 2016. And fourth, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. The change in our non-GAAP EPS guidance is entirely attributable to the change in non-GAAP tax rate.  For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q3 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million, including currency headwinds of approximately $17 million to $20 million year-over-year. We expect R&D expenses for the second half of the year will increase due to the timing of expenses and our continued investment in our pipeline. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $1.14 to $1.18 per share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have purchased 3.8 million shares and have approximately $425 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches, prioritizing investments in our robust pipeline, taking advantage of external opportunities that fit our strategic and financial goals and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"
347983,373738265,1015609,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vikas.

In Q2, our global commercial organization delivered an 18% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q2, we grew our global business through the continued strong addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, resulting in 15% Soliris volume growth year-over-year, despite ongoing headwinds in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH, in Q2, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, even in the territories where we have been operating the longest. And we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Since 2007, we have identified a similar number of new patients on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform, affirming our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, where we have been serving patients for nearly 5 years, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, who are in urgent need of treatment, we continue to focus on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic, lifelong nature of aHUS.
During the quarter, we identified a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS on a global basis, and we continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and aHUS in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to the launches of our two highly innovative, newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In Q2, we delivered another strong quarter of new patients initiating therapy. Our revenues benefited from the combination of the identification of patients prior to approval, newly identified patients in the quarter and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. We're leveraging the strong labels, which include substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise in the early phases of launch, we will continue to create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP.
Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As the robust U.S. launch of Strensiq advances, we are applying key learnings to Germany and Japan, where we are in the early stages of serving patients with HPP.
As we look to expand our launch to new countries, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR II rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP. As in France, we expect to continue to progress additional in-country funding processes for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continue to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We are applying our successful experience with Soliris and are accelerating disease education programs and targeted diagnostic initiatives to help pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance of early diagnosis. This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of noninfants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years.
Our LAL-D efforts are aided by our enhanced diagnostic pathway as we educate pediatric specialists on the signs and symptoms of the disease and the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis to support patient identification and earlier treatment.
Like with HPP, we are deploying a specialty diagnostic team for LAL-D and are starting to see increased dried blood spot testing of patients with liver and lipid abnormalities as well as more physicians now adding LAL-D to their routine diagnostic workup.
In addition, we are now targeting the largest U.S. pediatric centers to implement our diagnostic pathway. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., I'd like to note that the majority of Kanuma clinical trial patients were enrolled outside of the U.S. and remain in the extension trial. We expect to begin to transition these clinical trial patients onto commercial product towards the end of 2016 and into 2017, as we progress the in-country funding processes.
As we look to the second half of this year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris in PNH and aHUS, built on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP, and apply our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to identify more patients with a LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"
347983,373738265,1015609,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carsten.

Starting with eculizumab and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. Despite the narrow miss on the primary endpoint in the Phase III REGAIN study, I would like to highlight 3 key points. First, we believe the totality and consistency of data supports the potential of eculizumab to provide an early, sustained and substantial response in patients with this devastating complement-mediated disease. 
Second, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values less than 0.05, underscoring the pivotal role of complement inhibition in addressing the underlying cause of disease.
And third, we are in the process of engaging with regulators in the U.S. and Europe to work together to address the urgent need for patients with refractory GMG, who are suffering from debilitating muscle weakness and currently have no effective treatment. We expect to have an update by the end of the year.
Our ongoing Phase III trials with eculizumab and delayed-graft function and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are progressing as planned. We continue to expect data from our DGF Phase III trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing NMOSD Phase III trial this year.
Building on our strong foundation with Soliris, we are developing 8 additional innovative complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody that, like Soliris, leverages the only proven modality for safe, rapid, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
We are advancing our clinical program for ALXN1210 with two ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH. In these two studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with nearly 40 patients receiving ALXN1210.
Last month, new data from 13 patients in the Phase I/II study presented at the European Hematology Association Congress show that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing exhibited rapid reductions in LDH, which were sustained for up to 5 monthly dosing intervals of ALXN1210. 
Researchers also reported that at the time of the analysis, 80% of patients who required at least one blood transfusion in the 12 months prior to treatment with ALXN1210 did not require transfusions while on treatment. This interim data suggests that rapid, complete and sustained complement inhibition with ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of complement-mediated hemolysis and monthly dosing intervals.
We expect additional PNH data to be presented by the end of the year and continues to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical aHUS later this year.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantations. New interim data from 13 patients presented at EHA showed a high overall response rate at day 28 and day 56 in 77% of patients treated with ALXN1007. Complete GI-GVHD response rates at day 28 and 56 were 69% and 77%, respectively. These data continued to support the advancement of ALXN1007, where we are now evaluating higher doses in patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our CPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We are enrolling patients in a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. We also completed a study to characterize the natural history of MoCD Type A this quarter.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatments. Children suffering from the disease experience severe neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. New data from our ongoing Phase I/II trial represented earlier this month and preliminary evidence based on MRI and neurocognitive assessments at 6 months showed the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization, in patients with MPS IIIB. We have completed the planned dose escalation, with all patients now randomized to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10 milligram per kilogram dose. 
Additional SBC-103 data are expected in the first half of 2017. The interim data for SBC-103 administered IV provide evidence that are unique and proprietary put in expression platform could enable other enzyme-replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients.
We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

We've also been indicating for quite some time that that's obviously 2x the interval of where we stand today with eculizumab. And what we would be looking to do is test longer intervals.

As it relates to the impact of 1210 as opposed to eculizumab, I just state that the only attribute that we have really focused on is interval.

We are serving patients on an ongoing basis in countries where -- and even in this country, where access to treatment can be improved, and we would expect that, that would help us to meet the needs of more physicians and patients and reach out and even improve our ability to treat more patients.

We could spend quite a lot of time talking about this, but let me make a few points. And again, you heard David and I both mentioning we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing at various stages. And as part of that development, we're really very cognizant of our experience with Soliris, an antibody, and the attributes of that highly innovative therapy. And I'll just give you a few examples of things that we think about, and then that relates directly to your question about really the potential for other modalities, the detailed knowledge of the physical chemistry of C5 blockade in patients. And we've built this up over many years. The need, and we know about this to get immediate complete and sustained reduction of C5 activity greater than 99%, regardless of source. We also think about the pathways involved and very effective terminal complement blockade of all 3 of the pathways, whether it'd be alternative, classical or lifetime. A really important one, as you may imagine from this pathway, just Soliris leaves important immune response activity intact. It's another thing that you need to think about deeply as you develop other molecules. Again, with the antibody, no identified off-target effects, again, a critical part of developing any medicine and, of course, with Soliris proven long-term safety and efficacy for over 15 years now since the first PNH patient was dosed. So you put all that together, Geoff, it's an incredible hurdle. Soliris is a really terrific molecule. That said, and again as David alluded to, we think about ALXN1210 to be able to give these treatment options to patients.

As I mentioned, 1210, I think we've demonstrated with now nearly 40 patients actively on 1210 and 2 Ph",359,"Yes. The subQ program is very important to us. I'll ask Martin to come in, in just a moment. But as it relates to your question beyond 2018, few things. As I mentioned, 1210, I think we've demonstrated with now nearly 40 patients actively on 1210 and 2 Phase II trials, there's a unique way that we can execute these clinical programs. And so the point about perhaps others coming into the market to recruit patients, that may be something that -- and certainly we take any one of these matters very, very seriously. But we have a unique perspective on exactly where the patients are, the physicians who are managing them and unique capability to develop complement inhibitors. And that's how we were able to enroll nearly 40 patients so quickly. And we look to apply that, obviously, into our pivotal program as well as aHUS. Now one of the things that we'll be thoughtful about after the 2018 time frame is the impact of competitor trials. But I also come back to one of the earlier questions about how do we see 1210 and Soliris coexisting? What we know in our global operating platform is that we can reach many, many more patients with PNH and aHUS. And we realize that some of them do not receive the treatment because in every other week visit to whether they are and in many cases large, high reimbursable population developing nations where the physician or the patient may be uncomfortable with that every other week visit to an infusion center. And so we are also expecting with Soliris and the advance of 1210 that we'll be driving to even higher volume levels. And I would also just remind you, as we discussed today, we still see an extremely high proportion of PNH patients that are not yet diagnosed and/or treated. And aHUS is largely an incident market. So that's -- and Carsten and I have indicated, we're still not reaching a very large proportion of the aHUS patients. And so we see a tremendous opportunity to actually improve and increase our volumes during that time frame. And then Martin?"

In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.As our commercial team reached more patients during the",1326,"Thank you, Elena. In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.
As our commercial team reached more patients during the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth and improved our operating margins, while also progressing our robust R&D pipeline.
Our commercial organization delivered total year-over-year revenue growth of 18% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS being treated globally. Second, Strensiq, in only its third quarter of launch, is a new driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continued to progress since we've launched in the U.S. last quarter with newly identified patients starting on treatment.
In Q2, there were several highlights in our rare disease pipeline. The presentation of our Phase III REGAIN study, where we believe the strength of the data from the predefined endpoints and prospective analyses support the potential of eculizumab to provide an early sustained and substantial response in patients with refractory MG. These results will enable us to have constructive discussions with regulators, despite the narrow primary endpoint miss.
The presentation of Phase I/II data of monthly dosing of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH, the presentation of Phase I/II data of SBC-103 showing the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB, and the progress of our Phase III studies of eculizumab in DGF and NMO.
Now for a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris and PNH. In Q2, we continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients globally by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients.
Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
Moving to Soliris and aHUS. We once again served a consistently high number of new patients globally. We see a significant opportunity ahead to serve more patients, recognizing that a high number of patients with aHUS presenting with severe and rapidly progressing renal failure still do not receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with the improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that this trend of new patient additions will continue, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward, the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS gives us great confidence that the majority of growth in our core Soliris business is ahead of us.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 as we served an increasing number of patients with HPP, both children as well as adults with pediatric-onset disease. Our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives have been underway for more than 3 years and will continue to help us identify and serve more patients with Strensiq over time. By leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases, just 3 quarters into the launch, Strensiq now represents a new driver of growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S., which started in Q1. We are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of target physicians and accounts in order to reach more patients with LAL-D faster.
Like HPP, we are now deploying a specialty diagnostic team and are seeing early signs that our enhanced diagnostic pathway is leading to an increase in testing. We expect that these efforts will accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAL-D over time.
Moving on to R&D. We are leveraging our unique rare disease development capabilities to advance our highly innovative pipeline to drive additional growth. We have established our leadership in complement biology over the past 20 years, which gives us great conviction that our complement portfolio will enable us to serve an increasing number of patients.
Soliris remains in a position of strength with strong IP as well as regulatory data and orphan drug exclusivities in our core territories, extending through the end of this decade, and we expect well into next.
Building upon Soliris, one of our commitments and top priorities is to bring even higher levels of innovation to patients and physicians. Our R&D team is developing 8 complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody currently in 2 Phase II trials in patients with PNH. New Phase I/II data presented this quarter showed that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing had rapid and sustained reductions in LDH.
We are also evaluating ALXN1210 in longer dosing intervals and look forward to serving more patients with Soliris, ALXN1210 and our growing complement portfolio into the next decade and beyond.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016. We will have multiple R&D milestones, including an update on our progress with regulators for eculizumab and refractory MG, data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab and DGF, completion of enrollment in the Phase III NMO trial and additional ALXN1210 data in patients with PNH.
Beyond our complement portfolio, we continued to develop other highly innovative therapies. And in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. Martin will take a closer look at our pipeline later on the call.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter. We achieved total revenues of $753 million, an increase of 18% over Q2 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early progress of our Kanuma launch in the U.S. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
I also want to briefly touch on the SEC's interpretation on non-GAAP financial measures issued in May. We have modified our definition of our non-GAAP income tax expense to align with this recently issued interpretation. It is important to note that this modification will not change the amount of cash taxes we pay in 2016 or in the future or have any impact on our cash flow.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 reduction per share attributable entirely to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Prior to this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. And based on the strength of the Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million.
In addition, based on the change in our non-GAAP tax rate, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. As we did in Q2, we will accelerate EPS in 2016 and beyond, driven by continued growth of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma and operating expense discipline, which will expand our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"
347983,373738265,1016217,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

In Q2, we delivered strong financial performance while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Total revenues increased to $753 million. Our business grew year-over-year by 18%, with volume growth of 23%. Currency headwinds negatively impacted Q2 revenues by 3% or $18 million compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $701 million. Year-over-year volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS. While macroeconomic weakness in Latin America continues, the guidance we provided in April remains on track for the remainder of the year.
Turning to Strensiq. After only 3 quarters, a strong launch in driving new growth, and we reported revenues of $45 million. Looking at Kanuma, in just the second quarter since launch, we achieved revenues of $6 million, driven by our continued progress in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
Turning to taxes, we previously defined our non-GAAP income tax expense as being equal to the amount of cash income taxes paid or accrued on our current year performance. However, to align with the SEC interpretations on non-GAAP financial measures issued on May 17, which apply to U.S. public companies, we have modified our definition of non-GAAP tax expense. The modified definition no longer includes the cash tax benefits we've realized during the year from NOLs and income tax credits and now includes other deferred taxes.
It is important to note that this will not change the amount of cash taxes we will pay or have any impact on our cash flow. We ended last year with NOLs and tax credits that have a cash value of approximately $600 million. We are reporting a non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 16% for Q2.
As you can see on Slide 9 and the supplemental tax information tables in our press release, we are providing updated full year guidance of 15.5% to 16.5%. We have updated our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate to assist in your year-over-year comparisons. Long term, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of 13% to 15% in 2019 and beyond versus our prior year guidance -- previous guidance of 12% to 14%. This small change is a result of noncash deferred taxes.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12-per-share reduction attributable to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Without this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning to other elements of our 2016 guidance. I would like to highlight a few key points. First, we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. Second, based on the strength of Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million. Third, we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year of 2016. And fourth, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. The change in our non-GAAP EPS guidance is entirely attributable to the change in non-GAAP tax rate. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q3 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million, including currency headwinds of approximately $17 million to $20 million year-over-year. We expect R&D expenses for the second half of the year will increase due to the timing of expenses and our continued investment in our pipeline. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $1.14 to $1.18 per share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have purchased 3.8 million shares and have approximately $425 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches, prioritizing investments in our robust pipeline, taking advantage of external opportunities that fit our strategic and financial goals and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

Starting with Soliris. In Q2, we grew our global business through the continued strong addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, resulting in 15% Soliris volume growth year-over-year, despite ongoing headwinds in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH, in Q2, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, even in the territories where we have been operating the longest. And we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Since 2007, we have identified a similar number of new patients on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform, affirming our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, where we have been serving patients for nearly 5 years, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, who are in urgent need of treatment, we continue to focus on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic, lifelong nature of aHUS.
During the quarter, we identified a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS on a global basis, and we continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and aHUS in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to the launches of our 2 highly innovative, newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In Q2, we delivered another strong quarter of new patients initiating therapy. Our revenues benefited from the combination of the identification of patients prior to approval, newly identified patients in the quarter and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. We're leveraging the strong labels, which include substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise in the early phases of launch, we will continue to create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP.
Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As the robust U.S. launch of Strensiq advances, we are applying key learnings to Germany and Japan, where we are in the early stages of serving patients with HPP.
As we look to expand our launch to new countries, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR II rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP. As in France, we expect to continue to progress additional in-country funding processes for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continue to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We are applying our successful experience with Soliris and are accelerating disease education programs and targeted diagnostic initiatives to help pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance of early diagnosis. This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of noninfants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years.
Our LAL-D efforts are aided by our enhanced diagnostic pathway as we educate pediatric specialists on the signs and symptoms of the disease and the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis to support patient identification and earlier treatment.
Like with HPP, we are deploying a specialty diagnostic team for LAL-D and are starting to see increased dried blood spot testing of patients with liver and lipid abnormalities as well as more physicians now adding LAL-D to their routine diagnostic workup.
In addition, we are now targeting the largest U.S. pediatric centers to implement our diagnostic pathway. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., I'd like to note that the majority of Kanuma clinical trial patients were enrolled outside of the U.S. and remain in the extension trial. We expect to begin to transition these clinical trial patients onto commercial product towards the end of 2016 and into 2017, as we progress the in-country funding processes.
As we look to the second half of this year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris in PNH and aHUS, built on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP, and apply our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to identify more patients with a LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

Despite the narrow miss on the primary endpoint in the Phase III REGAIN study, I would like to high",899,"Thank you, Carsten. In Q2, we continued to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with eculizumab and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. Despite the narrow miss on the primary endpoint in the Phase III REGAIN study, I would like to highlight 3 key points. First, we believe the totality and consistency of data supports the potential of eculizumab to provide an early, sustained and substantial response in patients with this devastating, complement-mediated disease. 
Second, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values less than 0.05, underscoring the pivotal role of complement inhibition in addressing the underlying cause of disease.
And third, we are in the process of engaging with regulators in the U.S. and Europe to work together to address the urgent need for patients with refractory GMG, who are suffering from debilitating muscle weakness and currently have no effective treatment. We expect to have an update by the end of the year.
Our ongoing Phase III trials with eculizumab and delayed-graft function and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are progressing as planned. We continue to expect data from our DGF Phase III trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing NMOSD Phase III trial this year.
Building on our strong foundation with Soliris, we are developing 8 additional innovative complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody that, like Soliris, leverages the only proven modality for safe, rapid, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
We are advancing our clinical program for ALXN1210 with 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH. In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with nearly 40 patients receiving ALXN1210.
Last month, new data from 13 patients in the Phase I/II study presented at the European Hematology Association Congress show that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing exhibited rapid reductions in LDH, which were sustained for up to 5 monthly dosing intervals of ALXN1210. 
Researchers also reported that at the time of the analysis, 80% of patients who required at least 1 blood transfusion in the 12 months prior to treatment with the ALXN1210 did not require transfusions while on treatment. These interim data suggests that rapid, complete and sustained complement inhibition with the ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of complement-mediated hemolysis and monthly dosing intervals.
We expect additional PNH data to be presented by the end of the year and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with the ALXN1210 in patients with atypical aHUS later this year.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantations. New interim data from 13 patients presented at EHA showed a high overall response rate at day 28 and day 56 in 77% of patients treated with ALXN1007. Complete GI-GVHD response rates at day 28 and 56 were 69% and 77%, respectively. These data continued to support the advancement of ALXN1007, where we are now evaluating higher doses in patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We are enrolling patients in a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. We also completed a study to characterize the natural history of MoCD Type A this quarter.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatments. Children suffering from the disease experience severe neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. New data from our ongoing Phase I/II trial represented earlier this month and preliminary evidence based on MRI and neurocognitive assessments at 6 months showed the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB. We have completed the planned dose escalation, with all patients now randomized to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose. 
Additional SBC-103 data are expected in the first half of 2017. The interim data for SBC-103 administered IV provide evidence that are unique and proprietary put in expression platform could enable other enzyme-replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients.
We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional products or indication approvals through 2018.

And as Martin and I both discussed during the call, we saw, at monthly dosing, 100% of patients had an outstanding response to 1210. We've also been indicating for quite some time that, that's obviously 2x the interval of where we stand today with eculizumab. And what we would be looking to do is test longer intervals. Now without commenting on precisely whether or not it's quarterly, what we'd like to do, obviously, is have empiric data that we would all be sharing with you that you then could better understand what that dosing interval might be as we continue to progress the development program for 1210. And we look forward to updating you on this later toward the end of the year. As it relates to the impact of 1210 as opposed to eculizumab, I just state that the only attribute that we have really focused on is interval. And we do think that, in and of itself, depending upon whether or not it's monthly or longer makes a meaningful difference across our 50-country operating platform. We are serving patients on an ongoing basis in countries where -- and even in this country, where access to treatment can be improved, and we would expect that, that would help us to meet the needs of more physicians and patients and reach out and even improve our ability to treat more patients. But on top of that, with our pivotal programs that we are anticipating, we clearly will always look to provide as much innovation to patients as possible, both with dose interval and potentially with other clinical benefits to those patients as we optimize a highly innovative molecule."

At the same time, Martin and -- indicated that we're targeting an approval for 1210 in 2018 in PNH. And Carsten and his team are certainly working on what those scenario plans will be as we have 2 highly innovative complement inhibitors for patients with PNH. So it's too early to really comment on that go-to-market strategy with 1210 on top of Soliris. But certainly, as coming back to Eric's question, as we see the pivotal programs developing with regulators and we get closer to what would be the launch of 1210, we'll be able to provide you a better perspective on what our strategy is at that point.

We could spend quite a long time talking about this, but let me make a few points. And again, you heard David and I both mentioning we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing at various stages. And as part of that development, we're really very cognizant of our experience with Soliris, an antibody, and the attributes of that highly innovative therapy. And I'll just give you a few examples of things that we think about, and then that relates directly to your question about really the potential for other modalities, the detailed knowledge of the physical chemistry of C5 blockade in patients. And we've built this up over many years. The need, and we know about this to get immediate complete and sustained reduction of C5 activity greater than 99%, regardless of source. We also think about the pathways involved and very effective terminal complement blockade of all 3 of the pathways, whether it'd be alternative, classical or lifetime. A really important one, as you may imagine from this pathway, just Soliris leaves important immune response activity intact. It's another thing that you need to think about deeply as you develop other molecules. Again, with the antibody, no identified off-target effects, again, a critical part of developing any medicine and, of course, with Soliris proven long-term safety and efficacy for over 15 years now since the first PNH patient was dosed. So you put all that together, Geoff, it's an incredible hurdle. Soliris is a really terrific molecule. That said, and again as David alluded to, we think about ALXN1210 to be able to give these treatment options to patients. And then, of course, our other complement inhibitors that we'll speak more about in due course."

As I mentioned, 1210, I think we've demonstrated with now nearly 40 patients actively on 1210 in 2 Phase II trials, there's a unique way that we can execute these clinical programs. And so the point about perhaps others coming into the market to recruit patients, that may be something that -- and certainly we take any one of these matters very, very seriously. But we have a unique perspective on exactly where the patients are, the physicians who are managing them and unique capability to develop complement inhibitors. And that's how we were able to enroll nearly 40 patients so quickly. And we look to apply that, obviously, into our pivotal program as well as aHUS. Now one of the things that we'll be thoughtful about after the 2018 time frame is the impact of competitor trials. But I also come back to one of the earlier questions about how do we see 1210 and Soliris coexisting? What we know in our global operating platform is that we can reach many, many more patients with PNH and aHUS. And we realize that some of them do not receive the treatment because an every-other-week visit to wherever they are and in many cases large, high-reimbursable-population, developing nations where the physician or the patient may be uncomfortable with that every-other-week visit to an infusion center. And so we are also expecting with Soliris and the advance of 1210 that we'll be driving to even higher volume levels. And I would also just remind you, as we discussed today, we still see an extremely high proportion of PNH patients that are not yet diagnosed and/or treated. And aHUS is largely an incident market. So that's a -- and Carsten and I have indicated, we're still not reaching a very large proportion of the aHUS patients. And so we see a tremendous opportunity to actually improve and increase our volumes during that time frame. And then Martin?"

In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.As our commercial team reached more patients during the",1326,"Thank you, Elena. In Q2, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases as we continued to provide life-transforming therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.
As our commercial team reached more patients during the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth and improved our operating margins, while also progressing our robust R&D pipeline.
Our commercial organization delivered total year-over-year revenue growth of 18% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS being treated globally. Second, Strensiq, in only its third quarter of launch, is a new driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continued to progress since we've launched in the U.S. last quarter with newly identified patients starting on treatment.
In Q2, there were several highlights in our rare disease pipeline. The presentation of our Phase III REGAIN study, where we believe the strength of the data from the predefined endpoints and prospective analyses support the potential of eculizumab to provide an early sustained and substantial response in patients with refractory MG. These results will enable us to have constructive discussions with regulators, despite the narrow primary endpoint miss.
The presentation of Phase I/II data of monthly dosing of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH, the presentation of Phase I/II data of SBC-103 showing the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB, and the progress of our Phase III studies of eculizumab in DGF and NMO.
Now for a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris and PNH. In Q2, we continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients globally by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients.
Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. 
Moving to Soliris and aHUS. We once again served a consistently high number of new patients globally. We see a significant opportunity ahead to serve more patients, recognizing that a high number of patients with aHUS presenting with severe and rapidly progressing renal failure still do not receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with the improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that this trend of new patient additions will continue, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward, the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS gives us great confidence that the majority of growth in our core Soliris business is ahead of us.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 as we served an increasing number of patients with HPP, both children as well as adults with pediatric-onset disease. Our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives have been underway for more than 3 years and will continue to help us identify and serve more patients with Strensiq over time. By leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases, just 3 quarters into the launch, Strensiq now represents a new driver of growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S., which started in Q1. We are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of target physicians and accounts in order to reach more patients with LAL-D faster.
Like HPP, we are now deploying a specialty diagnostic team and are seeing early signs that our enhanced diagnostic pathway is leading to an increase in testing. We expect that these efforts will accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAL-D over time.
Moving on to R&D. We are leveraging our unique rare disease development capabilities to advance our highly innovative pipeline to drive additional growth. We have established our leadership in complement biology over the past 20 years, which gives us great conviction that our complement portfolio will enable us to serve an increasing number of patients.
Soliris remains in a position of strength with strong IP as well as regulatory data and orphan drug exclusivities in our core territories, extending through the end of this decade, and we expect well into next.
Building upon Soliris, one of our commitments and top priorities is to bring even higher levels of innovation to patients and physicians. Our R&D team is developing 8 complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody currently in 2 Phase II trials in patients with PNH. New Phase I/II data presented this quarter showed that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing had rapid and sustained reductions in LDH.
We are also evaluating ALXN1210 in longer dosing intervals and look forward to serving more patients with Soliris, ALXN1210 and our growing complement portfolio into the next decade and beyond.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016. We will have multiple R&D milestones, including an update on our progress with regulators for eculizumab and refractory MG, data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab and DGF, completion of enrollment in the Phase III NMO trial and additional ALXN1210 data in patients with PNH.
Beyond our complement portfolio, we continued to develop other highly innovative therapies. And in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. Martin will take a closer look at our pipeline later on the call.
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter. We achieved total revenues of $753 million, an increase of 18% over Q2 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early progress of our Kanuma launch in the U.S. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
I also want to briefly touch on the SEC's interpretation on non-GAAP financial measures issued in May. We have modified our definition of our non-GAAP income tax expense to align with this recently issued interpretation. It is important to note that this modification will not change the amount of cash taxes we pay in 2016 or in the future or have any impact on our cash flow.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 reduction per share attributable entirely to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Prior to this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. We are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. And based on the strength of the Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million.
In addition, based on the change in our non-GAAP tax rate, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. As we did in Q2, we will accelerate EPS in 2016 and beyond, driven by continued growth of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma and operating expense discipline, which will expand our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"
347983,373738265,1016761,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

In Q2, we delivered strong financial performance while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Total revenues increased to $753 million. Our business grew year-over-year by 18%, with volume growth of 23%. Currency headwinds negatively impacted Q2 revenues by 3% or $18 million compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Soliris revenues were $701 million. Year-over-year volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS. While macroeconomic weakness in Latin America continues, the guidance we provided in April remains on track for the remainder of the year.
Turning to Strensiq. After only 3 quarters, a strong launch in driving new growth, and we reported revenues of $45 million. Looking at Kanuma, in just the second quarter since launch, we achieved revenues of $6 million, driven by our continued progress in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, up from 42% in the prior quarter.
Turning to taxes, we previously defined our non-GAAP income tax expense as being equal to the amount of cash income taxes paid or accrued on our current year performance. However, to align with the SEC interpretations on non-GAAP financial measures issued on May 17, which apply to U.S. public companies, we have modified our definition of non-GAAP tax expense. The modified definition no longer includes the cash tax benefits we've realized during the year from NOLs and income tax credits and now includes other deferred taxes.
It is important to note that this will not change the amount of cash taxes we will pay or have any impact on our cash flow. We ended last year with NOLs and tax credits that have a cash value of approximately $600 million. We are reporting a non-GAAP income tax rate of approximately 16% for Q2.
As you can see on Slide 9 and the supplemental tax information tables in our press release, we are providing updated full year guidance of 15.5% to 16.5%. We have updated our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate to assist in your year-over-year comparisons. Long term, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of 13% to 15% in 2019 and beyond versus our prior year guidance -- previous guidance of 12% to 14%. This small change is a result of noncash deferred taxes.
In Q2, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share, which reflects a $0.12 per share reduction attributable to the modified definition of non-GAAP income tax expense. Without this modification, our Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.25 per share.
Turning to other elements of our 2016 guidance. I would like to highlight a few key points. First, we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance. Second, based on the strength of Strensiq launch, we are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $200 million to $220 million. Third, we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year of 2016. And fourth, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.65. The change in our non-GAAP EPS guidance is entirely attributable to the change in non-GAAP tax rate. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.
Turning briefly to Q3 guidance. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million, including currency headwinds of approximately $17 million to $20 million year-over-year. We expect R&D expenses for the second half of the year will increase due to the timing of expenses and our continued investment in our pipeline. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $1.14 to $1.18 per share.
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have purchased 3.8 million shares and have approximately $425 million remaining in our share repurchase program.
Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the core Soliris business and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches, prioritizing investments in our robust pipeline, taking advantage of external opportunities that fit our strategic and financial goals and repurchasing stock opportunistically.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

In Q2, our global commercial organization delivered an 18% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q2, we grew our global business through the continued strong addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, resulting in 15% Soliris volume growth year-over-year, despite ongoing headwinds in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH, in Q2, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH, even in the territories where we have been operating the longest. And we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Since 2007, we have identified a similar number of new patients on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform, affirming our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, where we have been serving patients for nearly 5 years, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 19 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, who are in urgent need of treatment, we continue to focus on 3 key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first-line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic, lifelong nature of aHUS.
During the quarter, we identified a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS on a global basis, and we continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and aHUS in front of us.
Now I would like to turn to the launches of our 2 highly innovative, newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq. In Q2, we delivered another strong quarter of new patients initiating therapy. Our revenues benefited from the combination of the identification of patients prior to approval, newly identified patients in the quarter and our long-term disease education efforts, which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP. We're leveraging the strong labels, which include substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise in the early phases of launch, we will continue to create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives, which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP.
Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As the robust U.S. launch of Strensiq advances, we are applying key learnings to Germany and Japan, where we are in the early stages of serving patients with HPP.
As we look to expand our launch to new countries, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR II rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP. As in France, we expect to continue to progress additional in-country funding processes for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continue to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We are applying our successful experience with Soliris and are accelerating disease education programs and targeted diagnostic initiatives to help pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance of early diagnosis. This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of noninfants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years.
Our LAL-D efforts are aided by our enhanced diagnostic pathway as we educate pediatric specialists on the signs and symptoms of the disease and the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis to support patient identification and earlier treatment.
Like with HPP, we are deploying a specialty diagnostic team for LAL-D and are starting to see increased dried blood spot testing of patients with liver and lipid abnormalities as well as more physicians now adding LAL-D to their routine diagnostic workup.
In addition, we are now targeting the largest U.S. pediatric centers to implement our diagnostic pathway. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., I'd like to note that the majority of Kanuma clinical trial patients were enrolled outside of the U.S. and remain in the extension trial. We expect to begin to transition these clinical trial patients onto commercial product towards the end of 2016 and into 2017, as we progress the in-country funding processes.
As we look to the second half of this year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris in PNH and aHUS, built on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP, and apply our deep experience in ultrarare diseases to identify more patients with a LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?"

Starting with eculizumab and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. Despite the narrow miss on the primary endpoint in the Phase III REGAIN study, I would like to highlight 3 key points. First, we believe the totality and consistency of data supports the potential of eculizumab to provide an early, sustained and substantial response in patients with this devastating, complement-mediated disease. 
Second, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values less than 0.05, underscoring the pivotal role of complement inhibition in addressing the underlying cause of disease.
And third, we are in the process of engaging with regulators in the U.S. and Europe to work together to address the urgent need for patients with refractory GMG, who are suffering from debilitating muscle weakness and currently have no effective treatment. We expect to have an update by the end of the year.
Our ongoing Phase III trials with eculizumab and delayed-graft function and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are progressing as planned. We continue to expect data from our DGF Phase III trial in the second half of this year. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing NMOSD Phase III trial this year.
Building on our strong foundation with Soliris, we are developing 8 additional innovative complement inhibitors with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting C5 antibody that, like Soliris, leverages the only proven modality for safe, rapid, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
We are advancing our clinical program for ALXN1210 with 2 ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH. In these 2 studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals and have exceeded target enrollment with nearly 40 patients receiving ALXN1210.
Last month, new data from 13 patients in the Phase I/II study presented at the European Hematology Association Congress show that 100% of patients with PNH treated with once monthly dosing exhibited rapid reductions in LDH, which were sustained for up to 5 monthly dosing intervals of ALXN1210. 
Researchers also reported that at the time of the analysis, 80% of patients who required at least 1 blood transfusion in the 12 months prior to treatment with the ALXN1210 did not require transfusions while on treatment. These interim data suggests that rapid, complete and sustained complement inhibition with the ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of complement-mediated hemolysis and monthly dosing intervals.
We expect additional PNH data to be presented by the end of the year and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with the ALXN1210 in patients with atypical aHUS later this year.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantations. New interim data from 13 patients presented at EHA showed a high overall response rate at day 28 and day 56 in 77% of patients treated with ALXN1007. Complete GI-GVHD response rates at day 28 and 56 were 69% and 77%, respectively. These data continued to support the advancement of ALXN1007, where we are now evaluating higher doses in patients with GI-GVHD.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We are enrolling patients in a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A, and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016. We also completed a study to characterize the natural history of MoCD Type A this quarter.
Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatments. Children suffering from the disease experience severe neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. New data from our ongoing Phase I/II trial represented earlier this month and preliminary evidence based on MRI and neurocognitive assessments at 6 months showed the potential for dose-dependent disease stabilization in patients with MPS IIIB. We have completed the planned dose escalation, with all patients now randomized to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose. 
Additional SBC-103 data are expected in the first half of 2017. The interim data for SBC-103 administered IV provide evidence that are unique and proprietary put in expression platform could enable other enzyme-replacement therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients.
We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional products or indication approvals through 2018.

We are serving patients on an ongoing basis in countries where -- and even in this country, where access to treatment can be improved, and we would expect that, that would help us to meet the needs of more physicians and patients and reach out and even improve our ability to treat more patients.

We could spend quite a long time talking about this, but let me make a few points. And again, you heard David and I both mentioning we have 8 complement inhibitors that we are developing at various stages. And as part of that development, we're really very cognizant of our experience with Soliris, an antibody, and the attributes of that highly innovative therapy. And I'll just give you a few examples of things that we think about, and then that relates directly to your question about really the potential for other modalities, the detailed knowledge of the physical chemistry of C5 blockade in patients. And we've built this up over many years. The need, and we know about this to get immediate complete and sustained reduction of C5 activity greater than 99%, regardless of source. We also think about the pathways involved and very effective terminal complement blockade of all 3 of the pathways, whether it'd be alternative, classical or lifetime. A really important one, as you may imagine from this pathway, just Soliris leaves important immune response activity intact. It's another thing that you need to think about deeply as you develop other molecules. Again, with the antibody, no identified off-target effects, again, a critical part of developing any medicine and, of course, with Soliris proven long-term safety and efficacy for over 15 years now since the first PNH patient was dosed. So you put all that together, Geoff, it's an incredible hurdle. Soliris is a really terrific molecule.

As I mentioned, 1210, I think we've demonstrated with now nearly 40 patients actively on 1210 in 2 Phase II trials, there's a unique way that we can execute these clinical programs. And so the point about perhaps others coming into the market to recruit patients, that may be something that -- and certainly we take any one of these matters very, very seriously. But we have a unique perspective on exactly where the patients are, the physicians who are managing them and unique capability to develop complement inhibitors. And that's how we were able to enroll nearly 40 patients so quickly. And we look to apply that, obviously, into our pivotal program as well as aHUS. Now one of the things that we'll be thoughtful about after the 2018 time frame is the impact of competitor trials. But I also come back to one of the earlier questions about how do we see 1210 and Soliris coexisting? What we know in our global operating platform is that we can reach many, many more patients with PNH and aHUS. And we realize that some of them do not receive the treatment because an every other week visit to wherever they are and in many cases large, high reimbursable population, developing nations where the physician or the patient may be uncomfortable with that every other week visit to an infusion center. And so we are also expecting with Soliris and the advance of 1210 that we'll be driving to even higher volume levels. And I would also just remind you, as we discussed today, we still see an extremely high proportion of PNH patients that are not yet diagnosed and/or treated. And aHUS is largely an incident market. So that's a -- and Carsten and I have indicated, we're still not reaching a very large proportion of the aHUS patients. And so we see a tremendous opportunity to actually improve and increase our volumes during that time frame. And then Martin?"

In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative mark",1146,"Thank you, Elena. In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS treated globally. Second, just 4 quarters in, Strensiq continues its robust launch and is an additional driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continues to progress in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients treated during the quarter.
In Q3, our R&D organization made great strides with our lead programs. First, for eculizumab and refractory MG, we are very pleased to have announced that we plan to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017. Second, with ALXN1210, we are now initiating our PNH registration trial with once every 8 week dosing intervals. Patient enrollment in this registration trial will start in Q4. Third, we have also accelerated the initiation of our aHUS registration trial of ALXN1210 with the same every 8 week dosing interval. Patient enrollment in this trial will also start in Q4. And fourth, we have commenced an ALXN1210 subcu program, with dosing underway of a new formulation administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. 
Taking a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris. In Q3, we continued to identify and treat a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH globally by executing our diagnostic initiatives with urgency. 
In aHUS, we, once again, served a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. And when adjusted for time for their respective approvals, we continue to believe that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward to our core Soliris business, we are confident that the majority of growth is in front of us due to the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS, along with our successful programs to identify new patients with both diseases.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our continued strong performance in Q3 as new patients with HPP started on treatment, both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our highly successful in HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. These initiatives enabled us to identify patients prior to approval and are also leading to a steady identification of new patients with HPP.
As we provide Strensiq to more patients in the U.S. and extend the global launch to more countries next year, we will continue to leverage our expertise in ultrarare diseases to reach more patients with HPP. We expect Strensiq to continue to be a strong additional driver of growth in 2017 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients starting on treatment during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts by leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases to extend our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians in order to reach more patients faster. 
Moving on to R&D. We are very pleased with the important progress we've made in Q3 on eculizumab and refractory MG and ALXN1210. Starting with eculizumab and refractory MG. We have had positive in-person meetings with both the FDA and EMA to review the comprehensive data from the Phase III REGAIN study, where 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified sensitivity analysis achieved p-values of less than 0.5. Based on these productive meetings, we now are planning to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017.
As we progress our refractory MG program, I'd like to remind you that eculizumab has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S., EU and Japan. We have strong intellectual property with Soliris with composition of matter patents into the next decade as well as meaningful regulatory, data and other orphan drug exclusivities extending through the end of this decade and well into the next. We continue to build and strengthen our global patent position for both Soliris and ALXN1210.
As one example, in Q3, a new U.S. patent was issued for treating aHUS with Soliris that is valid until 2032. We expect additional patents relating to Soliris in the U.S., Europe and other countries over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
In addition, our composition of matter patent for ALXN1210, which is in effect in the 2035, is now issued in more than 40 countries. While we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with Soliris, we are working with urgency to build on the strong foundation to bring even more innovation to the ultrarare disease communities. Today, we are very pleased to announce significant advancements in our broad ALXN1210 development program.
First, we are initiating simultaneous PNH and aHUS registration studies of ALXN1210 with every 8 week dosing. With this dosing schedule, patients would potentially be infused only 6x per year, which we believe will have a meaningful benefit for patients, families and physicians and enable even more patients to initiate treatment. And second, we have accelerated our ALXN1210 subcu program with dosing of a new formulation underway in healthy volunteers. 
With Soliris ALXN1210 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to further extend our leadership and complement biology for many years to come. We continue to develop other highly innovative therapies, and in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. 
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $799 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early contribution from the Kanuma launch in the U.S.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. We are also reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. Based on serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq, we now expect total revenues to be at the upper end of our guidance of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. This reflects our prior Soliris revenue guidance of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion and an increase in our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the continued strength of the Strensiq launch.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

Soliris revenues were $729 million. Year-over-year, volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Latin America.
Turning to Strensiq. Our strong growth continues, and we reported revenues of $61 million. In Q3, as in prior quarters, Strensiq revenues benefited from patients identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch in U.S., we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
Looking at Kanuma. We achieved revenues of $9 million, driven by our continued progress in diagnostic testing in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was largely driven by a continued improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, from approximately 27% in the year ago quarter to 25% in the current quarter. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Based on our strong operating results, we now expect to be at the upper end of our prior revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specifically, I would like to highlight a few key points. Total revenue guidance reflects that we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance, which includes an initial small impact from 1210 enrollment starting in the fourth quarter. We are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the strength of the Strensiq launch. Finally, we are -- we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year. 
Turning to operating expenses. We now forecast our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be $680 million to $690 million and our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be $790 million to $810 million. These increases reflect acceleration of the Alexion 1210 programs and additional investment in the global infrastructure to support the launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, as well as an increase in legal expenses.
Despite these changes, we continue to expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to remain unchanged. And finally, with our ongoing financial discipline, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS for 2016 to be at the upper end of our range of $4.50 to $4.65. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Looking ahead, as we continue to identify and serve a steady number of new patients with Soliris, we expect that patients recruitment for our current and anticipated ALXN1210 trials, as well as other studies, will have $70 million to $110 million impact on Soliris revenues in 2017, which will be reflected in our 2017 guidance.
With our growing in-line business and robust pipeline, we see long-term sustainable revenue growth through the end of this decade and beyond. We will continue to accelerate our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 and beyond through continued top line growth and expense discipline.
Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $431 million. [ph] Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares and have $325 million remaining. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy and the continued growth of our organization.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

In Q3, our global commercial organization delivered a strong 20% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of the Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q3, we grew our global business for the steady [ph] addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, despite ongoing delays in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH. In Q3, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH even in the territories where we have been operating the longest, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients. Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 5 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS and they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect to serve an increasing number of patients with aHUS over time. 
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with the success of our launch thus far. In just 4 quarters, we are achieving strong results as we serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our Strensiq performance benefited from patients that had been identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch, we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
To serve more patients, we will continue extending our disease education efforts, focusing on the mobilities and high mortality of HPP. These efforts underscore the natural history of the disease whereby 71% of infants die by 3 years of age. The few infants who survive and those with juvenile-onset HPP, face lifelong debilitating consequences, including recurrent and non-healing fractures, impleaded growth, disabling pain and the need for walkers or wheelchairs. We are leveraging our strong labels, which include a major survival benefit, substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve more patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq and treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As we look to expand the global onset of Strensiq, I would like to highlight our progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries. In Germany, we have reached the funding agreement that provides access to Strensiq to all patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
In France, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very ASMR2 rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP.
In England, [indiscernible] recognize the life changing clinical benefits of Strensiq for children with HPP. We continue to work with NICE and NHS England to reach a funding solution under the proposed managed access agreement that ensures that all patients with HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq.
And in Canada, the common drug recommendation is to list Strensiq for patients with pediatric-onset HPP. Turning now to Kanuma, where we continue to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We extending our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians so that patients with LAL-D receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Our newly deployed specialty diagnostic team is observing an increase in testing with our enhanced diagnostic pathway, and more physicians are now adding LAL-D testing to their routine diagnostic workups. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of children with LAL-D overtime.
In terms of clinical data, new evidence demonstrating the efficacy of Kanuma will be presented this quarter. At the AASLD Congress in early November, researchers will share new data from the Phase III ARISE trial, which demonstrate that in a cohort of children and adults with LAL-D, long-term Kanuma treatment resulted in a reduction of liver fibrosis. This is critical since 50% of children and adults with LAL-D progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver transplant within just 3 years of onset of disease.
In addition to this new data, we've also initiated an interventional study called detect the value of the valence of LAL-D and pediatric patients with specific, high risk clinical profile. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., we are pleased to have reached the funding agreement in Germany that provides all patients with LAL-D with access to Kanuma. For both, Strensiq and Kanuma, we will continue to progress the income from funding processes for additional European countries in the remainder of the 2016 and into 2017.
Building on our strong performance in Q3, and as we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris and PNH and aHUS, execute on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HBV and identifying more patients with LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma.
Now, I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our pipeline programs. Martin?"

In Q3, we achieved major milestones to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with our Phase III eculizumab program in refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, this is an ultrarare and debilitating complement-mediated disease in which patients have largely exhausted conventional therapy and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness throughout the body, resulting in slurred speech, impaired swallowing and choking, double vision, upper and lower extremity weakness, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath, due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure.
We have had positive in-person meetings with FDA and EMA where we reviewed that data from the Phase III REGAIN study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients. That robust dataset demonstrated a magnitude of effect of eculizumab and refractory MG patients across 4 separate validated scales of disease severity.
Importantly, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p values of less than 0.05. Based upon the strength of the data, and our positive meetings with the FDA and EMA, we now plan to file in both the U.S. and Europe in the first quarter of 2017.
Also in urology, the Phase III PREVENT study and relapsing NMOSD is ongoing, with data expected in 2017. And in transplant, we are on track to announce data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab in DGF this quarter.
With more than 20 years of complement inhibitor discovery and development expertise, we are committed to bring an even higher levels of innovation in the treatment of patients with complement-mediated diseases. We are very pleased to have accelerated our development program for ALXN1210, our longer acting anti-C5 antibody, with a half-life of 42 days, which leverages the only proven modalities for safe, immediate, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
As announced this morning, we've initiated simultaneous registration trial of ALXN1210 in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH and data [indiscernible] aHUS. Patients in both trials will be dosed every 8 weeks based on 3-way cohorts.
I would like to review some key points of the studies. First, the PNH study will be a Phase III open-label, randomized, multicenter, 26-week study of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab in 214 patients. One of the co-primary endpoints of the normalization of LDH levels, a measure of complement-mediated [indiscernible], which is central to the morbidities and mortality of PNH. The other co-primary end point as a percentage of patients who achieved transfusion avoidance. These endpoints reflect the high bar we have established with Soliris.
Second, we accelerated the ALXN1210 registration program for atypical HUS and are initiating a Phase III open-label, single-arm study in 55 adolescent and adult patients. The primary endpoint is complete from [indiscernible] response at 26 weeks, which also reflects the high bar established with Soliris in atypical HUS.
Third, we plan to initiate a Phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with atypical HUS in 2017. These robust registration studies have clinically meaningful endpoints, which reflect the use of regulators. We look forward to enrolling patients into the ALXN1210 registration studies and continue to target the first approval in 2018.
In addition to the progress with the registration trials, we are pleased to have accelerated the development of our ALXN1210 subcutaneous program to explore a new formulation with dosing underway in healthy volunteers.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel antiinflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We continue to progress our Phase II study to evaluate higher doses of the ALXN1007, in patients with [indiscernible] versus host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life threatening rare auto-immune disease that can occur complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The European Commission and the FDA have granted orphan drug designation to ALXN1007 for the treatment of patients with GVHD. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210, ALXN1007 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to extend our leadership in complement biology. Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type a, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. Enrollment is ongoing and a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in the [indiscernible]with MoCD Type A. 
Turning now to SBC-103, a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatments. We have completed the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II trial, with all patients now randomized to either a 5-milligram per kilogram or 10-milligram per kilogram dose and expect to present additional SBC-103 data next year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society announced last week a multi-arm acute myeloid leukemia study, referred to as the BEAT AML Master Trial, evaluating samalizumab, or ALXN6000, as well as other potential therapies for the treatment of AML. Samalizumab is a first-in-class immunomodulatory humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CD200, a key immune checkpoint protein expressed in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Samalizumab may have a role as a targeted cancer therapy to a small subset of patients that have limited treatment options.
In addition to samalizumab, we are also progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs. We are excited about the multiple milestones and our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

And so when we think about an 8-week interval, whereby patients would be visiting their hospital or their clinic, and of course, there's also home infusion available as well, we're talking about 6 infusions a year, which we see as being a meaningful difference in that decision between patients and physicians on undertaking treatment and remaining on treatment frankly. And across our 50-country platform, we do not take for granted that a visit to a clinic is something that is a simple or a visit from a home infusion agency is simple. And then so to meaningfully reduce that that event in and of itself of the infusion, we see as being an opportunity to reach more patients. And of course, we believe the majority of PNH patients are still in front of us and there's a still a very high incidence of aHUS, and we believe that we can reach many more patients that present with complement-mediated TMA that may not be served today. So that's on the offense part of this. As it relates to how would these 2 coexist, look I think that we have brought plans with 1210 to serve a variety of different medical specialties record most impotently, patients with a variety of different company but the beauty diseases. And so we've always said we wanted to provide as many of the highest innovation treatment options to patients as they possibly could have that meet with their objectives and their lifestyle to effectively and safely treat their life-threatening disease, and that's how we see it all fitting together at this point."

In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative mark",1146,"Thank you, Elena. In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continued to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS treated globally. Second, just 4 quarters in, Strensiq continues its robust launch and is an additional driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continues to progress in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients treated during the quarter.
In Q3, our R&D organization made great strides with our lead programs. First, for eculizumab in refractory MG, we are very pleased to have announced that we plan to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017. Second, with ALXN1210, we are now initiating our PNH registration trial with once every 8 week dosing intervals. Patient enrollment in this registration trial will start in Q4. Third, we have also accelerated the initiation of our aHUS registration trial of ALXN1210 with the same every 8 week dosing interval. Patient enrollment in this trial will also start in Q4. And fourth, we have commenced an ALXN1210 subcu program, with dosing underway of a new formulation administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. 
Taking a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris. In Q3, we continued to identify and treat a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH globally by executing our diagnostic initiatives with urgency. 
In aHUS, we, once again, served a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. And when adjusted for time for their respective approvals, we continue to believe that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward to our core Soliris business, we are confident that the majority of growth is in front of us due to the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS, along with our successful programs to identify new patients with both diseases.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our continued strong performance in Q3 as new patients with HPP started on treatment, both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our highly successful in HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. These initiatives enabled us to identify patients prior to approval and are also leading to a steady identification of new patients with HPP.
As we provide Strensiq to more patients in the U.S. and extend the global launch to more countries next year, we will continue to leverage our expertise in ultrarare diseases to reach more patients with HPP. We expect Strensiq to continue to be a strong additional driver of growth in 2017 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients starting on treatment during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts by leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases to extend our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians in order to reach more patients faster. 
Moving on to R&D. We are very pleased with the important progress we've made in Q3 on eculizumab in refractory MG and ALXN1210. Starting with eculizumab in refractory MG. We have had positive in-person meetings with both the FDA and EMA to review the comprehensive data from the Phase III REGAIN study, where 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified sensitivity analysis achieved p-values of less than 0.5. Based on these productive meetings, we now are planning to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017.
As we progress our refractory MG program, I'd like to remind you that eculizumab has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S., EU and Japan. We have strong intellectual property with Soliris with composition of matter patents into the next decade as well as meaningful regulatory, data and other orphan drug exclusivities extending through the end of this decade and well into the next. We continue to build and strengthen our global patent position for both Soliris and ALXN1210.
As one example, in Q3, a new U.S. patent was issued for treating aHUS with Soliris that is valid until 2032. We expect additional patents relating to Soliris in the U.S., Europe and other countries over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
In addition, our composition of matter patent for ALXN1210, which is in effect in the 2035, is now issued in more than 40 countries. While we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with Soliris, we are working with urgency to build on the strong foundation to bring even more innovation to the ultrarare disease communities. Today, we are very pleased to announce significant advancements in our broad ALXN1210 development program.
First, we are initiating simultaneous PNH and aHUS registration studies of ALXN1210 with every 8 week dosing. With this dosing schedule, patients would potentially be infused only 6x per year, which we believe will have a meaningful benefit for patients, families and physicians and enable even more patients to initiate treatment. And second, we have accelerated our ALXN1210 subcu program with dosing of a new formulation underway in healthy volunteers. 
With Soliris ALXN1210 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to further extend our leadership and complement biology for many years to come. We continue to develop other highly innovative therapies, and in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. 
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $799 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early contribution from the Kanuma launch in the U.S.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. We are also reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. Based on serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq, we now expect total revenues to be at the upper end of our guidance of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. This reflects our prior Soliris revenue guidance of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion and an increase in our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the continued strength of the Strensiq launch.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $799 million or 20% above the year ago quarter. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 23% increase in volume, partially offset by currency headwinds of 2.5% or $16 million compared to the year ago quarter.
Soliris revenues were $729 million. Year-over-year, volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Latin America.
Turning to Strensiq. Our strong growth continues, and we reported revenues of $61 million. In Q3, as in prior quarters, Strensiq revenues benefited from patients identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch in U.S., we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
Looking at Kanuma. We achieved revenues of $9 million, driven by our continued progress in diagnostic testing in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was largely driven by a continued improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, from approximately 27% in the year ago quarter to 25% in the current quarter. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Based on our strong operating results, we now expect to be at the upper end of our prior revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specifically, I would like to highlight a few key points. Total revenue guidance reflects that we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance, which includes an initial small impact from 1210 enrollment starting in the fourth quarter. We are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the strength of the Strensiq launch. Finally, we are -- we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year. 
Turning to operating expenses. We now forecast our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be $680 million to $690 million and our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be $790 million to $810 million. These increases reflect acceleration of the Alexion 1210 programs and additional investment in the global infrastructure to support the launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, as well as an increase in legal expenses.
Despite these changes, we continue to expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to remain unchanged. And finally, with our ongoing financial discipline, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS for 2016 to be at the upper end of our range of $4.50 to $4.65. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Looking ahead, as we continue to identify and serve a steady number of new patients with Soliris, we expect that patients recruitment for our current and anticipated ALXN1210 trials, as well as other studies, will have $70 million to $110 million impact on Soliris revenues in 2017, which will be reflected in our 2017 guidance.
With our growing in-line business and robust pipeline, we see long-term sustainable revenue growth through the end of this decade and beyond. We will continue to accelerate our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 and beyond through continued top line growth and expense discipline.
Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $421 million. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares and have $325 million remaining. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy and the continued growth of our organization.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

In Q3, our global commercial organization delivered a strong 20% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of the Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q3, we grew our global business for the steady addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, despite ongoing delays in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH. In Q3, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH even in the territories where we have been operating the longest, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients. Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 5 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect to serve an increasing number of patients with aHUS over time. 
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with the success of our launch, thus far. In just 4 quarters, we are achieving strong results as we serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our Strensiq performance benefited from patients that had been identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch, we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
To serve more patients, we will continue extending our disease education efforts, focusing on the mobilities and high mortality of HPP. These efforts underscore the natural history of the disease, whereby 71% of infants die by 3 years of age. The few infants who survive and those with juvenile-onset HPP face lifelong debilitating consequences, including recurrent and non-healing fractures, impeded growth, disabling pain and the need for walkers or wheelchairs. We are leveraging our strong labels, which include a major survival benefit, substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve more patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As we look to expand the global onset of Strensiq, I would like to highlight our progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries. In Germany, we have reached the funding agreement that provides access to Strensiq to all patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
In France, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR2 rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP.
In England, NICE recognized the life-changing clinical benefits of Strensiq for children with HPP. We continue to work with NICE and NHS England to reach a funding solution under the proposed managed access agreement that ensures that all patients with HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq.
And in Canada, the common drug review recommendation is to list Strensiq for patients with pediatric-onset HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continued to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We're extending our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians so that patients with LAL-D receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Our newly deployed specialty diagnostic team is observing an increase in testing with our enhanced diagnostic pathway, and more physicians are now adding LAL-D testing to their routine diagnostic workup. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of children with LAL-D, overtime.
In terms of clinical data, new evidence demonstrating the efficacy of Kanuma will be presented this quarter. At the AASLD Congress in early November, researchers will share new data from the Phase III ARISE trial, which demonstrate that in a cohort of children and adults with LAL-D, long-term Kanuma treatment resulted in a reduction of liver fibrosis. This is critical since 50% of children and adults with LAL-D progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver transplant within just 3 years of onset of disease.
In addition to this new data, we have also initiated a non-interventional study called DETECT to evaluate prevalence of LAL-D in pediatric patients with a specific high-risk clinical profile. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., we are pleased to have reached the funding agreement in Germany that provides all patients with LAL-D with access to Kanuma. For both, Strensiq and Kanuma, we will continue to progress the income through funding processes for additional European countries in the remainder of the 2016 and into 2017.
Building on our strong performance in Q3, and as we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris and PNH and aHUS, execute on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP and identify more patients with LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma.
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our pipeline programs. Martin?"

In Q3, we achieved major milestones to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with our Phase III eculizumab program in refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, this is an ultrarare and debilitating complement-mediated disease in which patients have largely exhausted conventional therapy and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness throughout the body, resulting in slurred speech, impaired swallowing and choking, double vision, upper and lower extremity weakness, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure.
We have had positive in-person meetings with the FDA and EMA where we reviewed that data from the Phase III REGAIN study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients. The robust dataset demonstrated the magnitude of effect of eculizumab in refractory MG patients across 4 separate validated scales of disease severity.  
Importantly, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values of less than 0.05. Based upon the strength of the data and our positive meetings with the FDA and EMA, we now plan to file in both the U.S. and Europe in the first quarter of 2017.
Also in urology, the Phase III PREVENT study and relapsing NMOSD is ongoing, with data expected in 2017. And in transplant, we are on track to announce data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab in DGF this quarter.
With more than 20 years of complement inhibitor discovery and development expertise, we are committed to bringing even higher levels of innovation in the treatment of patients with complement-mediated diseases. We are very pleased to have accelerated our development program for ALXN1210, our longer acting anti-C5 antibody, with a half-life of 42 days, which leverages the only proven modality for safe, immediate, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
As announced this morning, we have initiated simultaneous registration trial of ALXN1210 in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH and atypical HUS. Patients in both trials will be dosed every 8 weeks based on 3 weight cohorts.
I would like to review some key points of the studies. First, the PNH study will be a Phase III open-label, randomized, multicenter, 26-week study of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab in 214 patients. One of the co-primary endpoints is the normalization of LDH levels, a measure of complement-mediated hemolysis, which is central for the morbidities and mortality of PNH. The other co-primary end point is the percentage of patients who achieved transfusion avoidance. These endpoints reflect the high bar we have established with Soliris.
Second, we accelerated the ALXN1210 registration program for atypical HUS and are initiating a Phase III open-label, single-arm study in 55 adolescent and adult patients. The primary endpoint is complete thrombotic microangiopathy response at 26 weeks, which also reflects the high bar established with Soliris in atypical HUS.
Third, we plan to initiate a Phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with atypical HUS in 2017. These robust registration studies have clinically meaningful endpoints, which reflect the views of regulators. We look forward to enrolling patients into the ALXN1210 registration studies and continue to target the first approval in 2018.
In addition to the progress with the registration trials, we are pleased to have accelerated the development of our ALXN1210 subcutaneous program to explore a new formulation, with dosing underway in healthy volunteers.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We continue to progress our Phase II study to evaluate higher doses of ALXN1007 in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare auto-immune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The European Commission and the FDA have granted orphan drug designation to ALXN1007 for the treatment of patients with GVHD. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210, ALXN1007 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to extend our leadership in complement biology. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. Enrollment is ongoing and a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A. 
Turning now to SBC-103, a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatments. We have completed the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II trial, with all patients now randomized to either a 5 milligram per kilogram or 10 milligram per kilogram dose and expect to present additional SBC-103 data next year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society announced last week a multi-arm acute myeloid leukemia study, referred to as the Beat AML Master Trial, evaluating samalizumab, or ALXN6000, as well as other potential therapies for the treatment of AML. Samalizumab is a first-in-class immunomodulatory humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CD200, a key immune checkpoint protein expressed in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Samalizumab may have a role as a targeted cancer therapy to a small subset of patients that have limited treatment options.
In addition to samalizumab, we are also progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

First of all, if I break your question up into the 2 aspects, in terms of atypical HUS, we have been able to really use the empiric data that we have from the PNH study to date, the 40 patients with our modeling, et cetera, that helped to inform the factor to be single-arm. And then just as you may imagine, the way the atypical HUS presents a much more difficult study to run with a competitor arm, so putting those 2 together, the competitive study with eculizumab and then, the single-arm with atypical HUS. And then in terms of the 8 weeks, I'd really refer back to some of the things I said with Anupam. A number of things have gone into the decision here to choose the 8 weeks and also the dosage. And it's the 40-patient data that we have to date with ALXN1210. That certainly helped inform the real world experience we've been able to bring to bear on those studies. The modeling data, extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. And then the feedback from regulators, as I say, and putting those 4 things together very much informs both the dose and the dosing interval."

So yes, first, what we know very well from our nearly 10 years of serving patients with PNH, and now exceeding 5 years with aHUS, is that as you look at both the patients who would initiate treatment and then, of course, these are chronic diseases that require chronic treatment, what we have come to certainly understand from the medical community and from the patients that we serve is that some make decisions despite the life-threatening illness that they have to try to forego treatment and try to delay treatment, or perhaps even discontinue treatment earlier than one would with a life-threatening disease. And so when we think about an 8-week interval, whereby patients would be visiting their hospital or their clinic, and of course, there's also home infusion available as well, we're talking about 6 infusions a year, which we see as being a meaningful difference in that decision between patients and physicians on undertaking treatment and remaining on treatment, frankly. And across our 50-country platform, we do not take for granted that a visit to a clinic is something that is simple, or a visit from a home infusion agency is simple. And then, so to meaningfully reduce that  event in and of itself of the infusion, we see as being an opportunity to reach more patients. And of course, we believe the majority of PNH patients are still in front of us and there's a still a very high incidence of aHUS, and we believe that we can reach many more patients that present with complement-mediated TMA that may not be served today. So that's on the offense part of this. As it relates to how would these 2 coexist, look, I think that we have broad plans with 1210 to serve a variety of different medical specialties and most impotently, patients with a variety of different complement-mediated diseases. And so we've always said we wanted to provide as many of the highest innovation treatment options to patients as they possibly could have that meet with their objectives and their lifestyle to effectively and safely treat their life-threatening complement-mediated disease, and that's how we see it all fitting together at this point."

In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative mark",1144,"Thank you, Elena. In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continue to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS treated globally. Second, just 4 quarters in, Strensiq continues its robust launch and is an additional driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continues to progress in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients treated during the quarter.
In Q3, our R&D organization made great strides with our lead programs. First, for eculizumab in refractory MG, we are very pleased to have announced that we plan to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017. Second, with ALXN1210, we are now initiating our PNH registration trial with once every 8 week dosing intervals. Patient enrollment in this registration trial will start in Q4. Third, we have also accelerated the initiation of our aHUS registration trial of ALXN1210 with the same every 8 week dosing interval. Patient enrollment in this trial will also start in Q4. And fourth, we have commenced an ALXN1210 subcu program, with dosing underway of a new formulation administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. 
Taking a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris. In Q3, we continued to identify and treat a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH globally by executing our diagnostic initiatives with urgency. 
In aHUS, we, once again, served a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. And when adjusted for time for their respective approvals, we continue to believe that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward to our core Soliris business, we are confident that the majority of growth is in front of us due to the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS, along with our successful programs to identify new patients with both diseases.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our continued strong performance in Q3 as new patients with HPP started on treatment, both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. These initiatives enabled us to identify patients prior to approval and are also leading to a steady identification of new patients with HPP.
As we provide Strensiq to more patients in the U.S. and extend the global launch to more countries next year, we will continue to leverage our expertise in ultrarare diseases to reach more patients with HPP. We expect Strensiq to continue to be a strong additional driver of growth in 2017 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients starting on treatment during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts by leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases to extend our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians in order to reach more patients faster. 
Moving on to R&D. We are very pleased with the important progress we've made in Q3 on eculizumab in refractory MG and ALXN1210. Starting with eculizumab in refractory MG. We have had positive in-person meetings with both the FDA and EMA to review the comprehensive data from the Phase III REGAIN study, where 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified sensitivity analysis achieved p-values of less than 0.5. Based on these productive meetings, we now are planning to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017.
As we progress our refractory MG program, I'd like to remind you that eculizumab has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S., EU and Japan. We have strong intellectual property with Soliris with composition of matter patents into the next decade as well as meaningful regulatory, data and other orphan drug exclusivities extending through the end of this decade and well into the next. We continue to build and strengthen our global patent position for both Soliris and ALXN1210.
As one example in Q3, a new U.S. patent was issued for treating aHUS with Soliris that is valid until 2032. We expect additional patents relating to Soliris in the U.S., Europe and other countries over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
In addition, our composition of matter patent for ALXN1210, which is in effect into 2035, is now issued in more than 40 countries. While we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with Soliris, we are working with urgency to build on the strong foundation to bring even more innovation to the ultrarare disease communities. Today, we are very pleased to announce significant advancements in our broad ALXN1210 development program.
First, we are initiating simultaneous PNH and aHUS registration studies of ALXN1210 with every 8 week dosing. With this dosing schedule, patients would potentially be infused only 6x per year, which we believe will have a meaningful benefit for patients, families and physicians and enable even more patients to initiate treatment. And second, we have accelerated our ALXN1210 subcu program with dosing of a new formulation underway in healthy volunteers. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to further extend our leadership and complement biology for many years to come. We continue to develop other highly innovative therapies, and in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. 
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $799 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early contribution from the Kanuma launch in the U.S.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. We are also reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. Based on serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq, we now expect total revenues to be at the upper end of our guidance of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. This reflects our prior Soliris revenue guidance of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion and an increase in our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the continued strength of the Strensiq launch.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $799 million or 20% above the year ago quarter. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 23% increase in volume, partially offset by currency headwinds of 2.5% or $16 million compared to the year ago quarter.
Soliris revenues were $729 million. Year-over-year, volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Latin America.
Turning to Strensiq. Our strong growth continues, and we reported revenues of $61 million. In Q3, as in prior quarters, Strensiq revenues benefited from patients identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch in U.S., we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
Looking at Kanuma. We achieved revenues of $9 million, driven by our continued progress in diagnostic testing in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was largely driven by a continued improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, from approximately 27% in the year ago quarter to 25% in the current quarter. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Based on our strong operating results, we now expect to be at the upper end of our prior revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specifically, I would like to highlight a few key points. Total revenue guidance reflects that we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance, which includes an initial small impact from 1210 enrollment starting in the fourth quarter. We are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the strength of the Strensiq launch. Finally, we are -- we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year. 
Turning to operating expenses. We now forecast our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be $680 million to $690 million and our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be $790 million to $810 million. These increases reflect acceleration of the Alexion 1210 programs and additional investment in the global infrastructure to support the launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, as well as an increase in legal expenses.
Despite these changes, we continue to expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to remain unchanged. And finally, with our ongoing financial discipline, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS for 2016 to be at the upper end of our range of $4.50 to $4.65. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Looking ahead, as we continue to identify and serve a steady number of new patients with Soliris, we expect that patients recruitment for our current and anticipated ALXN1210 trials, as well as other studies, will have $70 million to $110 million impact on Soliris revenues in 2017, which will be reflected in our 2017 guidance.
With our growing in-line business and robust pipeline, we see long-term sustainable revenue growth through the end of this decade and beyond. We will continue to accelerate our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 and beyond through continued top line growth and expense discipline.
Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $421 million. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares and have $325 million remaining. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy and the continued growth of our organization.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

In Q3, our global commercial organization delivered a strong 20% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of the Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q3, we grew our global business for the steady addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, despite ongoing delays in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH. In Q3, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH even in the territories where we have been operating the longest, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients. Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 5 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect to serve an increasing number of patients with aHUS over time. 
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with the success of our launch, thus far. In just 4 quarters, we are achieving strong results as we serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our Strensiq performance benefited from patients that had been identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch, we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
To serve more patients, we will continue extending our disease education efforts, focusing on the mobilities and high mortality of HPP. These efforts underscore the natural history of the disease, whereby 71% of infants die by 3 years of age. The few infants who survive and those with juvenile-onset HPP face lifelong debilitating consequences, including recurrent and non-healing fractures, impeded growth, disabling pain and the need for walkers or wheelchairs. We are leveraging our strong labels, which include a major survival benefit, substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve more patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As we look to expand the global onset of Strensiq, I would like to highlight our progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries. In Germany, we have reached the funding agreement that provides access to Strensiq to all patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
In France, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR2 rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP.
In England, NICE recognized the life-changing clinical benefits of Strensiq for children with HPP. We continue to work with NICE and NHS England to reach a funding solution under the proposed managed access agreement that ensures that all patients with HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq.
And in Canada, the common drug review recommendation is to list Strensiq for patients with pediatric-onset HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continued to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We're extending our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians so that patients with LAL-D receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Our newly deployed specialty diagnostic team is observing an increase in testing with our enhanced diagnostic pathway, and more physicians are now adding LAL-D testing to their routine diagnostic workup. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of children with LAL-D, overtime.
In terms of clinical data, new evidence demonstrating the efficacy of Kanuma will be presented this quarter. At the AASLD Congress in early November, researchers will share new data from the Phase III ARISE trial, which demonstrate that in a cohort of children and adults with LAL-D, long-term Kanuma treatment resulted in a reduction of liver fibrosis. This is critical since 50% of children and adults with LAL-D progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver transplant within just 3 years of onset of disease.
In addition to this new data, we have also initiated a non-interventional study called DETECT to evaluate prevalence of LAL-D in pediatric patients with a specific high-risk clinical profile. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., we are pleased to have reached the funding agreement in Germany that provides all patients with LAL-D with access to Kanuma. For both, Strensiq and Kanuma, we will continue to progress the income through funding processes for additional European countries in the remainder of the 2016 and into 2017.
Building on our strong performance in Q3, and as we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris and PNH and aHUS, execute on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP and identify more patients with LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma.
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our pipeline programs. Martin?"

In Q3, we achieved major milestones to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with our Phase III eculizumab program in refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, this is an ultrarare and debilitating complement-mediated disease in which patients have largely exhausted conventional therapy and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness throughout the body, resulting in slurred speech, impaired swallowing and choking, double vision, upper and lower extremity weakness, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure.
We have had positive in-person meetings with the FDA and EMA where we reviewed that data from the Phase III REGAIN study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients. The robust dataset demonstrated a magnitude of effect of eculizumab in refractory MG patients across 4 separate validated scales of disease severity.  
Importantly, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values of less than 0.05. Based upon the strength of the data and our positive meetings with the FDA and EMA, we now plan to file in both the U.S. and Europe in the first quarter of 2017.
Also in neurology, the Phase III PREVENT study and relapsing NMOSD is ongoing, with data expected in 2017. And in transplant, we are on track to announce data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab in DGF this quarter.
With more than 20 years of complement inhibitor discovery and development expertise, we are committed to bringing even higher levels of innovation in the treatment of patients with complement-mediated diseases. We are very pleased to have accelerated our development program for ALXN1210, our longer acting anti-C5 antibody, with a half-life of 42 days, which leverages the only proven modality for safe, immediate, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
As announced this morning, we have initiated simultaneous registration trial of ALXN1210 in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH and atypical HUS. Patients in both trials will be dosed every 8 weeks based on 3 weight cohorts.
I would like to review some key points of the studies. First, the PNH study will be a Phase III open-label, randomized, multicenter, 26-week study of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab in 214 patients. One of the co-primary endpoints is the normalization of LDH levels, a measure of complement-mediated hemolysis, which is central for the morbidities and mortality of PNH. The other co-primary end point is the percentage of patients who achieved transfusion avoidance. These endpoints reflect the high bar we have established with Soliris.
Second, we accelerated the ALXN1210 registration program for atypical HUS and are initiating a Phase III open-label, single-arm study in 55 adolescent and adult patients. The primary endpoint is complete thrombotic microangiopathy response at 26 weeks, which also reflects the high bar established with Soliris in atypical HUS.
Third, we plan to initiate a Phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with atypical HUS in 2017. These robust registration studies have clinically meaningful endpoints, which reflect the views of regulators. We look forward to enrolling patients into the ALXN1210 registration studies and continue to target the first approval in 2018.
In addition to the progress with the registration trials, we are pleased to have accelerated the development of our ALXN1210 subcutaneous program to explore a new formulation, with dosing underway in healthy volunteers.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We continue to progress our Phase II study to evaluate higher doses of ALXN1007 in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare auto-immune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The European Commission and the FDA have granted orphan drug designation to ALXN1007 for the treatment of patients with GVHD. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210, ALXN1007 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to extend our leadership in complement biology. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. Enrollment is ongoing and a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A. 
Turning now to SBC-103, a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatment. We have completed the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II trial, with all patients now randomized to either a 5 milligram per kilogram or 10 milligram per kilogram dose and expect to present additional SBC-103 data next year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society announced last week a multi-arm acute myeloid leukemia study, referred to as the Beat AML Master Trial, evaluating samalizumab, or ALXN6000, as well as other potential therapies for the treatment of AML. Samalizumab is a first-in-class immunomodulatory humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CD200, a key immune checkpoint protein expressed in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Samalizumab may have a role as a targeted cancer therapy to a small subset of patients that have limited treatment options.
In addition to samalizumab, we are also progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.
I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

And then in terms of the 8 weeks, I'd really refer back to some of the things I said with Anupam. A number of things have gone into the decision here to choose the 8 weeks and also the dosage. And it's the 40-patient data that we have to date with ALXN1210. That certainly helped inform the real world experience we've been able to bring to bear on those studies. The modeling data, extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic.

So yes, first, what we know very well from our nearly 10 years of serving patients with PNH, and now exceeding 5 years with aHUS, is that as you look at both the patients who would initiate treatment and then, of course, these are chronic diseases that require chronic treatment, what we have come to certainly understand from the medical community and from the patients that we serve is that some make decisions despite the life-threatening illness that they have to try to forego treatment and try to delay treatment, or perhaps even discontinue treatment earlier than one would with a life-threatening disease. And so when we think about an 8-week interval, whereby patients would be visiting their hospital or their clinic, and of course, there's also home infusion available as well, we're talking about 6 infusions a year, which we see as being a meaningful difference in that decision between patients and physicians on undertaking treatment and remaining on treatment, frankly. And across our 50-country platform, we do not take for granted that a visit to a clinic is something that is simple, or a visit from a home infusion agency is simple. And then, so to meaningfully reduce that event in and of itself of the infusion, we see as being an opportunity to reach more patients. And of course, we believe the majority of PNH patients are still in front of us and there's a still a very high incidence of aHUS, and we believe that we can reach many more patients that present with complement-mediated TMA that may not be served today. So that's on the offense part of this. As it relates to how would these 2 coexist, look, I think that we have broad plans with 1210 to serve a variety of different medical specialties and most impotently, patients with a variety of different complement-mediated diseases. And so we've always said we wanted to provide as many of the highest innovation treatment options to patients as they possibly could have that meets with their objectives and their lifestyle to effectively and safely treat their life-threatening complement-mediated disease, and that's how we see it all fitting together at this point."

And when I look at PNH and aHUS together, these are severe ultrarare devastating diseases. PNH, a 5-year death rate of 35%. And with eculizumab, what has been with investigators is a now -- an expectation of near-normal life spans. And with aHUS, where half of patients either die, progress to ESRD or a permanent renal damage, just within 12 months after diagnosis. We see, with eculizumab, 80% of those patients that were on dialysis before receiving eculizumab were be able -- were able to eliminate dialysis.

In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative mark",1144,"Thank you, Elena. In Q3, the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives. Our commercial organization achieved total year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 23%, driven by the strength of our 3 highly innovative marketed therapies.
First, Soliris continue to grow with a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS treated globally. Second, just 4 quarters in, Strensiq continues its robust launch and is an additional driver of growth. And third, Kanuma continues to progress in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients treated during the quarter.
In Q3, our R&D organization made great strides with our lead programs. First, for eculizumab in refractory MG, we are very pleased to have announced that we plan to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017. Second, with ALXN1210, we are now initiating our PNH registration trial with once every 8 week dosing intervals. Patient enrollment in this registration trial will start in Q4. Third, we have also accelerated the initiation of our aHUS registration trial of ALXN1210 with the same every 8 week dosing interval. Patient enrollment in this trial will also start in Q4. And fourth, we have commenced an ALXN1210 subcu program, with dosing underway of a new formulation administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. 
Taking a closer look at our commercial performance, starting with Soliris. In Q3, we continued to identify and treat a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH globally by executing our diagnostic initiatives with urgency. 
In aHUS, we, once again, served a consistently high number of new patients across our 50-country platform. And when adjusted for time for their respective approvals, we continue to believe that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
As we look forward to our core Soliris business, we are confident that the majority of growth is in front of us due to the combination of the high proportion of undiagnosed patients with PNH and the high incidence of aHUS, along with our successful programs to identify new patients with both diseases.
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with our continued strong performance in Q3 as new patients with HPP started on treatment, both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than 3 years. These initiatives enabled us to identify patients prior to approval and are also leading to a steady identification of new patients with HPP.
As we provide Strensiq to more patients in the U.S. and extend the global launch to more countries next year, we will continue to leverage our expertise in ultrarare diseases to reach more patients with HPP. We expect Strensiq to continue to be a strong additional driver of growth in 2017 and beyond.
And with Kanuma, we continue to make progress in the initial stage of our launch in the U.S. and Germany, with new patients starting on treatment during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts by leveraging our expertise in ultrarare diseases to extend our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians in order to reach more patients faster. 
Moving on to R&D. We are very pleased with the important progress we've made in Q3 on eculizumab in refractory MG and ALXN1210. Starting with eculizumab in refractory MG. We have had positive in-person meetings with both the FDA and EMA to review the comprehensive data from the Phase III REGAIN study, where 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified sensitivity analysis achieved p-values of less than 0.5. Based on these productive meetings, we now are planning to file regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe in Q1 2017.
As we progress our refractory MG program, I'd like to remind you that eculizumab has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S., EU and Japan. We have strong intellectual property with Soliris with composition of matter patents into the next decade as well as meaningful regulatory, data and other orphan drug exclusivities extending through the end of this decade and well into the next. We continue to build and strengthen our global patent position for both Soliris and ALXN1210.
As one example in Q3, a new U.S. patent was issued for treating aHUS with Soliris that is valid until 2032. We expect additional patents relating to Soliris in the U.S., Europe and other countries over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
In addition, our composition of matter patent for ALXN1210, which is in effect into 2035, is now issued in more than 40 countries. While we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with Soliris, we are working with urgency to build on the strong foundation to bring even more innovation to the ultrarare disease communities. Today, we are very pleased to announce significant advancements in our broad ALXN1210 development program.
First, we are initiating simultaneous PNH and aHUS registration studies of ALXN1210 with every 8 week dosing. With this dosing schedule, patients would potentially be infused only 6x per year, which we believe will have a meaningful benefit for patients, families and physicians and enable even more patients to initiate treatment. And second, we have accelerated our ALXN1210 subcu program with dosing of a new formulation underway in healthy volunteers. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to further extend our leadership and complement biology for many years to come. We continue to develop other highly innovative therapies, and in total, we expect to deliver up to 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018. 
Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $799 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2015, with volume growth of 23%. This year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the continued growth of Soliris across geographies, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the early contribution from the Kanuma launch in the U.S.
During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. We are also reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share.
Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance. Based on serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq, we now expect total revenues to be at the upper end of our guidance of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. This reflects our prior Soliris revenue guidance of $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion and an increase in our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the continued strength of the Strensiq launch.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We are pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $799 million or 20% above the year ago quarter. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 23% increase in volume, partially offset by currency headwinds of 2.5% or $16 million compared to the year ago quarter.
Soliris revenues were $729 million. Year-over-year, volume growth was driven by continued global growth in PNH and aHUS, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Latin America.
Turning to Strensiq. Our strong growth continues, and we reported revenues of $61 million. In Q3, as in prior quarters, Strensiq revenues benefited from patients identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch in U.S., we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
Looking at Kanuma. We achieved revenues of $9 million, driven by our continued progress in diagnostic testing in the early stages of the launch in the U.S. and Germany. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, up from 43% in the year ago quarter. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was largely driven by a continued improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, from approximately 27% in the year ago quarter to 25% in the current quarter. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 per diluted share. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Based on our strong operating results, we now expect to be at the upper end of our prior revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specifically, I would like to highlight a few key points. Total revenue guidance reflects that we are reiterating our Soliris revenue guidance, which includes an initial small impact from 1210 enrollment starting in the fourth quarter. We are increasing our metabolic revenue guidance to $225 million to $235 million based on the strength of the Strensiq launch. Finally, we are -- we continue to forecast FX headwinds of $70 million to $80 million, net of our hedging activities for the full year. 
Turning to operating expenses. We now forecast our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be $680 million to $690 million and our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be $790 million to $810 million. These increases reflect acceleration of the Alexion 1210 programs and additional investment in the global infrastructure to support the launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, as well as an increase in legal expenses.
Despite these changes, we continue to expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to remain unchanged. And finally, with our ongoing financial discipline, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS for 2016 to be at the upper end of our range of $4.50 to $4.65. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.
Looking ahead, as we continue to identify and serve a steady number of new patients with Soliris, we expect that patients recruitment for our current and anticipated ALXN1210 trials, as well as other studies, will have $70 million to $110 million impact on Soliris revenues in 2017, which will be reflected in our 2017 guidance.
With our growing in-line business and robust pipeline, we see long-term sustainable revenue growth through the end of this decade and beyond. We will continue to accelerate our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 and beyond through continued top line growth and expense discipline.
Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in debt. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $421 million. Since the authorization of our $1 billion share repurchase program last year, we have repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares and have $325 million remaining. Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with the flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy and the continued growth of our organization.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

In Q3, our global commercial organization delivered a strong 20% increase in revenue and 23% volume growth year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Soliris, the strong launch of Strensiq in initial countries and the progression of the Kanuma launch in the U.S. and Germany.
Starting with Soliris. In Q3, we grew our global business for the steady addition of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan, despite ongoing delays in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America.
In PNH. In Q3, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH even in the territories where we have been operating the longest, and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Given that 1/3 of undiagnosed and untreated patients with PNH will die within 5 years, we aim to deliver the benefits of Soliris to even more patients. Our 9-year track record of consistently identifying a similar number of new patients with PNH on a quarterly basis across our 50-country platform affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients starting on Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 5 years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than they have been for PNH. And importantly, we are seeing the same trends globally, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.
Given the higher incidence of aHUS compared to PNH, combined with improvements we continue to make to our diagnostic initiatives, we expect to serve an increasing number of patients with aHUS over time. 
Turning now to Strensiq. We are very pleased with the success of our launch, thus far. In just 4 quarters, we are achieving strong results as we serve an increasing number of patients with pediatric-onset HPP. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our Strensiq performance benefited from patients that had been identified prior to approval. As we enter the second year of launch, we expect that the majority of patients newly starting on Strensiq will be newly diagnosed.
To serve more patients, we will continue extending our disease education efforts, focusing on the mobilities and high mortality of HPP. These efforts underscore the natural history of the disease, whereby 71% of infants die by 3 years of age. The few infants who survive and those with juvenile-onset HPP face lifelong debilitating consequences, including recurrent and non-healing fractures, impeded growth, disabling pain and the need for walkers or wheelchairs. We are leveraging our strong labels, which include a major survival benefit, substantial bone healing and improvements in growth and mobility to serve more patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
As we apply our expertise, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme. As we look to expand the global onset of Strensiq, I would like to highlight our progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries. In Germany, we have reached the funding agreement that provides access to Strensiq to all patients with pediatric-onset HPP.
In France, we are pleased to have received strong recognition from the French government, with a very high ASMR2 rating, reflective of the high innovation and major clinical impact of Strensiq for patients with HPP.
In England, NICE recognized the life-changing clinical benefits of Strensiq for children with HPP. We continue to work with NICE and NHS England to reach a funding solution under the proposed managed access agreement that ensures that all patients with HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq.
And in Canada, the common drug review recommendation is to list Strensiq for patients with pediatric-onset HPP. 
Turning now to Kanuma, where we continued to make progress on our launch in the U.S. and Germany. We're extending our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic pathway initiatives to a greater number of target physicians so that patients with LAL-D receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Our newly deployed specialty diagnostic team is observing an increase in testing with our enhanced diagnostic pathway, and more physicians are now adding LAL-D testing to their routine diagnostic workup. We expect these programs to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of children with LAL-D, overtime.
In terms of clinical data, new evidence demonstrating the efficacy of Kanuma will be presented this quarter. At the AASLD Congress in early November, researchers will share new data from the Phase III ARISE trial, which demonstrate that in a cohort of children and adults with LAL-D, long-term Kanuma treatment resulted in a reduction of liver fibrosis. This is critical since 50% of children and adults with LAL-D progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver transplant within just 3 years of onset of disease.
In addition to this new data, we have also initiated a non-interventional study called DETECT to evaluate prevalence of LAL-D in pediatric patients with a specific high-risk clinical profile. As we expand our launch beyond the U.S., we are pleased to have reached the funding agreement in Germany that provides all patients with LAL-D with access to Kanuma. For both, Strensiq and Kanuma, we will continue to progress the income through funding processes for additional European countries in the remainder of the 2016 and into 2017.
Building on our strong performance in Q3, and as we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident that our commercial organization will deliver continued growth for Soliris and PNH and aHUS, execute on the strong launch of Strensiq to serve more patients with HPP and identify more patients with LAL-D who can benefit from Kanuma.
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our pipeline programs. Martin?"

In Q3, we achieved major milestones to advance our robust rare disease pipeline. Starting with our Phase III eculizumab program in refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, this is an ultrarare and debilitating complement-mediated disease in which patients have largely exhausted conventional therapy and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness throughout the body, resulting in slurred speech, impaired swallowing and choking, double vision, upper and lower extremity weakness, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure.
We have had positive in-person meetings with the FDA and EMA where we reviewed that data from the Phase III REGAIN study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients. The robust dataset demonstrated a magnitude of effect of eculizumab in refractory MG patients across 4 separate validated scales of disease severity.  
Importantly, 18 of 22 predefined endpoints and prespecified analyses in this study, based on the primary and 5 secondary endpoints, achieved p-values of less than 0.05. Based upon the strength of the data and our positive meetings with the FDA and EMA, we now plan to file in both the U.S. and Europe in the first quarter of 2017.
Also in neurology, the Phase III PREVENT study and relapsing NMOSD is ongoing, with data expected in 2017. And in transplant, we are on track to announce data from the Phase III trial of eculizumab in DGF this quarter.
With more than 20 years of complement inhibitor discovery and development expertise, we are committed to bringing even higher levels of innovation in the treatment of patients with complement-mediated diseases. We are very pleased to have accelerated our development program for ALXN1210, our longer acting anti-C5 antibody, with a half-life of 42 days, which leverages the only proven modality for safe, immediate, complete and sustained C5 inhibition.
As announced this morning, we have initiated simultaneous registration trial of ALXN1210 in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH and atypical HUS. Patients in both trials will be dosed every 8 weeks based on 3 weight cohorts.
I would like to review some key points of the studies. First, the PNH study will be a Phase III open-label, randomized, multicenter, 26-week study of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab in 214 patients. One of the co-primary endpoints is the normalization of LDH levels, a measure of complement-mediated hemolysis, which is central for the morbidities and mortality of PNH. The other co-primary end point is the percentage of patients who achieved transfusion avoidance. These endpoints reflect the high bar we have established with Soliris.
Second, we accelerated the ALXN1210 registration program for atypical HUS and are initiating a Phase III open-label, single-arm study in 55 adolescent and adult patients. The primary endpoint is complete thrombotic microangiopathy response at 26 weeks, which also reflects the high bar established with Soliris in atypical HUS.
Third, we plan to initiate a Phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with atypical HUS in 2017. These robust registration studies have clinically meaningful endpoints, which reflect the views of regulators. We look forward to enrolling patients into the ALXN1210 registration studies and continue to target the first approval in 2018.
In addition to the progress with the registration trials, we are pleased to have accelerated the development of our ALXN1210 subcutaneous program to explore a new formulation, with dosing underway in healthy volunteers.
Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting complement protein C5a. We continue to progress our Phase II study to evaluate higher doses of ALXN1007 in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare auto-immune disease that can occur as a complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The European Commission and the FDA have granted orphan drug designation to ALXN1007 for the treatment of patients with GVHD. 
With Soliris, ALXN1210, ALXN1007 and additional complement inhibitors in our portfolio, we are well positioned to extend our leadership in complement biology. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. Enrollment is ongoing and a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A. 
Turning now to SBC-103, a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, a rare and devastating disorder with no available treatment. We have completed the planned dose escalation in our Phase I/II trial, with all patients now randomized to either a 5 milligram per kilogram or 10 milligram per kilogram dose and expect to present additional SBC-103 data next year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society announced last week a multi-arm acute myeloid leukemia study, referred to as the Beat AML Master Trial, evaluating samalizumab, or ALXN6000, as well as other potential therapies for the treatment of AML. Samalizumab is a first-in-class immunomodulatory humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CD200, a key immune checkpoint protein expressed in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Samalizumab may have a role as a targeted cancer therapy to a small subset of patients that have limited treatment options.
In addition to samalizumab, we are also progressing our preclinical pipeline of approximately 30 programs. We are excited about the multiple milestones in our expanding pipeline and are driving towards as many as 6 additional product or indication approvals through 2018.

So yes, first, what we know very well from our nearly 10 years of serving patients with PNH, and now exceeding 5 years with aHUS, is that as you look at both the patients who would initiate treatment and then, of course, these are chronic diseases that require chronic treatment, what we have come to certainly understand from the medical community and from the patients that we serve is that some make decisions despite the life-threatening illness that they have to try to forego treatment and try to delay treatment, or perhaps even discontinue treatment earlier than one would with a life-threatening disease. And so when we think about an 8-week interval, whereby patients would be visiting their hospital or their clinic, and of course, there's also home infusion available as well, we're talking about 6 infusions a year, which we see as being a meaningful difference in that decision between patients and physicians on undertaking treatment and remaining on treatment, frankly. And across our 50-country platform, we do not take for granted that a visit to a clinic is something that is simple, or a visit from a home infusion agency is simple. And then, so to meaningfully reduce that event in and of itself of the infusion, we see as being an opportunity to reach more patients. And of course, we believe the majority of PNH patients are still in front of us and there's a still a very high incidence of aHUS, and we believe that we can reach many more patients that present with complement-mediated TMA that may not be served today. So that's on the offense part of this. As it relates to how would these 2 coexist, look, I think that we have broad plans with 1210 to serve a variety of different medical specialties and most impotently, patients with a variety of different complement-mediated diseases. And so we've always said we wanted to provide as many of the highest innovation treatment options to patients as they possibly could have that meets with their objectives and their lifestyle to effectively and safely treat their life-threatening complement-mediated disease, and that's how we see it all fitting together at this point."

And with eculizumab, what has been with investigators is a now -- an expectation of near-normal life spans. And with aHUS, where half of patients either die, progress to ESRD or a permanent renal damage, just within 12 months after diagnosis.
