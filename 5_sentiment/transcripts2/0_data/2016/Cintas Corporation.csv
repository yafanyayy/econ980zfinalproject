With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary,  we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Lit",816,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary,  we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216,000,000, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year third quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%. 
Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to one operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior year period. 
As a result of our third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860,000,000 to $4,890,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed on the table within today's press release. 
Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an average cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. 
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal year 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increase in EPS. Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in U.S. gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs. We have distinct competitive advantages. Our corporate culture, which guides and drives everything that we do; our innovative and expansive product lines that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition; and an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and brightest service structure in North America. These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better. These strong financial results, our unmatched scale and our focus on the long term allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the products and service offerings compared to others in the industry. We are able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, ready for the workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers and helping them prepare for their work days. This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross-selling efforts. It's also energizing our partners, who are now even more ready for our customers. And we're able to make transformative investments such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes after Paul provides more third quarter details, but these investments will continue to strengthen our industry-leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get ready for the workday. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,328308428,955143,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter",912,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015. Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have 1 less day than this year. We estimate that this 1 less they will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. Note, however, that we continue to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Recall that effective June 1st of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; First Aid and Safety Services; and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 [ph] million, which was 50% higher than last year third quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. 
On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently-acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is in process. The completion of which is indeed close of the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about 6 months. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also, note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of December 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $76 million in uniform rental; $6 million in first aid and safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. 
Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike, who will provide some additional information related to our investment in SAP. Mike?"

Our investment into SAP system began years ago. We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning",581,"Thanks, Paul. Our investment into SAP system began years ago. We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing. With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million. We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing it. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next 3 to 4 months and then move into the pilot stage. The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced 2 years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job. In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we have made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system and to our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so. Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016, therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half of a year of depreciation. It will also include about a half of a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal '17 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortize over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional -- other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal '19, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our industry, struggle with these large implementation projects. Our financial strength and commitment to long-term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resources assistant us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm has been working with us every step of the way. And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide. 
That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions."

We hear a lot of good news from our locations, but it's too early to tell whether that's having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters. But getting back to the products and services, Joe, we spent a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invested a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers and, again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, ready for the workday. And Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail-inspired products like Carhartt and our wrinkle-free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer folks solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions. And the beautiful thing about these products are they're all proprietary. All of these that I've mentioned are proprietary and can't be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will -- when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000 or so customers out there that are warm leads. And even though they are warm leads, we don't get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers. But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said, GDP and employment in the industry because in part, we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also -- we've got a very, very diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us. You see others in our industry, who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it as we have products and services that just reach farther and reach broader than our competition. So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have. And we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on our R&D. I'm not ready to announce any new products, but Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry because we are innovative, we've got a broader product line, we've got a diverse customer base and we've got a great penetration opportunity.

And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration. But having said that, look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, 2 more quarters of integration. The integration is going well. Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly, some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business, we're integrating a different business than Cintas is and we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that. Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers as well as starting to get into the ZEE penetration opportunities. We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business, but our ZEE customers generally have been only first aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training, services, AEDs, et cetera.

This is the largest and the first national campaign certainly that includes television and it is the largest campaign that we have our done. And so why now? Look, we think it's the right time to continue to get our brand awareness greater and greater throughout the country. We've had many customers over  the years say to us, gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know is that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had Fire Protection Services, I didn't know that you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking, we need to educate. And so we thought that, look, now's a great time to do this, because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well. We've got a lot of great product, a lot of fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America. But when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas. They can maybe help us get ready for the workday. And so we think it's a great time to do that because we're executing well, we've got a lot of good products and services and we think it's going to give us some momentum going into the future."

Yes, we absolutely think there are and that would be -- we'll incorporate those thoughts in our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So yes, we do think that ZEE -- and the first aid margins are certainly going to improve. From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind, this is the largest project that we've ever done. And as we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really setting to see the -- power of the system, and we're excited about getting this implemented and we believe that the power -- but there is the power in the system that we hope for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure that we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers. And one of the risk-mitigating things about the way we are rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen 1 at a time. And so it's not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this 1 at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us, but it extends the roll out a little bit as well through that fiscal '18. And so, look, we think we're doing this the right way, as I mentioned, we've seen others both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that that's not going to happen to us. Now certainly, those numbers that I gave you are fairly large. And as you know, made, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become the next couple of years. Now in fiscal '17, look, we're only going to be on probably less than half of our locations and  I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit in fiscal '18. We might start to see a little bit of system benefit, but it's going to be muted, because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations. But having said that, again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact to our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will be able to offset all $30 million to $35 million? No, but we'll do our best to manage that impact. 
Look, we don't do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that's going to carry us for a long time and it's worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years."

And so effectively for something like the last 46, 47 years, we've grown in 45, 44 of them, and so that was a big one. And now the next recession a lot depends on how deep and broad it is. But one of the things that -- when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the health care space back then, we were not much in financial services and other professional environments. We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also first aid and fire protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less or are more resistant, unlike healthcare, to a recession. I think the other thing that I would say that's different is today, our uniform, total uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we lose many customers, but a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers like hygiene products and services, like the Fire Protection Services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire resistant clothing. So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it."

It's been more new customers, as I understand it. And then I go back to this number you gave us on the fourth quarter every year and, I guess, I'm waiting next quarter of the mix between rental and the mix of all the 5 or 6 different things you gave us has been exactly the same percentages for 4 straight fiscal years. So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past.

First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last 5 or 6 years and will continue to always be important to us. New business -- when we sell into account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer. We have to earn the customer's trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us, first of all, because they bring revenue, but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities. And so new business will always be very important to us, it is now and will continue to be. And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it's a legacy rental metric and when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn't apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions. That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements and we don't like to -- we don't pay attention to it quite as much internally because it's just losing its importance as we broaden our business. So I would say new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important. And the reason that you haven't seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because it's all been growing and it's really important for us that it all grows because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers.

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216,000,000, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year third quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%. 
Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior year period. 
As a result of our third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860,000,000 to $4,890,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed on the table within today's press release. 
Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. 
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal year 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in U.S. gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs. We have distinct competitive advantages: our corporate culture, which guides and drives everything that we do; our innovative and expansive product line that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition; and an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and broadest service structure in North America. These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better. These strong financial results, our unmatched scale, and our focus on the long term allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the product and service offerings compared to others in the industry. We were able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, ready for the workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers and helping them prepare for their work days. This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross-selling efforts. It's also energizing our partners, who are now even more ready for our customers. And we're able to make transformative investments such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes after Paul provides more third quarter details, but these investments will continue to strengthen our industry-leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get ready for the workday. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,328308428,955172,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter",911,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015. Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have one less day than this year. We estimate that this one less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. Note, however, that we continue to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; First Aid and Safety Services; and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 million, which was 50% higher than last year's third quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. 
On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is in process, the completion of which is integral to the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about 6 months. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of November 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $76 million in Uniform Rental; $6 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. 
Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike, who will provide some additional information related to our investment in SAP. Mike?"

We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing. With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million. We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing it. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next 3 to 4 months and then move into the pilot stage. The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced 2 years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job. In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we've made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system into our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so. Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016, therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 years of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 years of system maintenance costs. The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal '17 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional -- other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but we'll likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our own industry, struggle with these large implementation projects. Our financial strength and commitment to the long term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resource assisting us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm, has been working with us every step of the way. And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide. 
That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions."

We are really excited about it and it really speaks well of the value that we offer. I would say that reactions, though, to the campaign are primarily anecdotal. We hear a lot of good news from our locations, but it's too early to tell whether that's having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters. But getting back to the products and services, Joe, we spend a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invest a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers. And again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, ready for the workday. And Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail-inspired products like Carhartt and our wrinkle-free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer focus solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions. And the beautiful thing about these products are they're all proprietary. All of these that I've mentioned are proprietary and can't be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will -- when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000-or-so customers out there that are warm leads. And even though they're warm leads, it -- we don't get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers. But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said, GDP and employment and the industry because in part, we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also -- we've got a very, very diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us. You see others in our industry, who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it we have products and services that just reach farther and reach broader than our competition. So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have, and we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on our R&D. I'm not ready to announce any new products, but Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry because we are innovative, we've got a broader product line, we've got a diverse customer base and we've got a great penetration opportunity. And we think that has served us very well in the past and will continue to serve us into the future."

It was more than 1/3 of the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business. That's priority #1. But clearly, yes, when we are on the SAP system, one of the benefits is that all of our operations will have more visibility and clarity into our customers and the different products and services that they have or don't have. And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration. But having said that, hey, look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, 2 more quarters of integration. The integration is going well. Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly, some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business, we're integrating a different business than Cintas is and we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that. Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers as well as starting to get into the ZEE penetration opportunities. We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business, but our ZEE customers generally have been only first aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training, services, AEDs, et cetera. And so we have -- we feel like we got a good penetration opportunity there, and I think our 11.9% organic growth speaks to that a little bit."

In terms of the energy, the cost side of it, though, I think the price per barrel really dropped low in our third quarter. I think it reached $26 at one point. It's kind of rebounded through the $40 threshold. So I think if it stays at about that level, more energy as a percent of our revenue would probably be more in line with our Q2, which was about 2.0% of revenue. And in Q4 last year, our energy was about 2.2%. So the bottom line is we're expecting probably about 20 basis points of benefit from the prices at the pump but then really offset by the headcount reductions that we expect to continue to incur into Q4."

I didn't know that you had fire protection services, I didn't know that you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking, we need to educate.

We believe that more of our customers in the sector are stable or growing as opposed to shrinking. But of course, we understand the headwinds that are out there and the industry statistics so we'll continue to monitor it. But yes, you nailed it. At this point in time, the only negative impact in any particular sector is from oil and gas and coal as well."

Yes, we absolutely think there are and that will be -- we'll incorporate those thoughts into our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So yes, we do think that ZEE is -- and the First Aid margins are certainly going to improve. From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind, this is the largest project that we've ever done. And as we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really starting to see the power of the system, and we're excited about getting this implemented and we believe that the power -- there is -- the power in the system that we hoped for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure that we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers. And one of the risk-mitigating things about the way we're rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen one at a time. And so it's not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this one at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us, but it extends the roll out a little bit as well through that fiscal '18. And so we -- look, we think we're doing this the right way. As I mentioned, we've seen others both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that that's not going to happen to us. Now certainly those numbers that I gave you are fairly large. And as you know, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become in the next couple of years. Now in fiscal '17, look, we're only going to be on probably less than half of our locations and I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit in fiscal '18. We might start to see a little bit of system benefit, but it's going to be muted because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations. But having said that, again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact through our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will we be able to offset all $30 million to $35 million? No, but we'll do our best to manage that impact. 
Look, we don't do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that's going to carry us for a long time and it's worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years."

So effectively, for something like the last 46, 47 years, we've grown in 45 -- 44 of them. So that was a big one. And now the next recession, a lot depends on how deep and broad it is. But I -- one of the things that -- when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it, 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the health care space back then, we were not much in financial services and other professional environments. We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also First Aid and Fire Protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less or more resistant, unlike health care, to a recession. I think the other thing that I would say that's different is today, our Uniform, total Uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we lose many customers, but a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers like hygiene products and services, like the Fire Protection Services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire-resistant clothing. So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it."

And then I go back to this number you give us on the fourth quarter every year, and I guess I'm awaiting next quarter, of the mix within rental and the mix of all the 5 or 6 different things you give us has been exactly the same percentages for 4 straight fiscal years. So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past.

First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last 5 or 6 years and will continue to always be important to us. New business -- when we sell a new account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer. We have to earn the customer's trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us, first of all, because they bring revenue, but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities. And so new business will always be very important to us. It is now and will continue to be. And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it's a legacy rental metric. And when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn't apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions. That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements and we don't like to -- we don't pay attention to it quite as much internally because it's just losing its importance as we broaden our business. So I would say new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important. And the reason that you haven't seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because it's all been growing, and it's really important for us that it all grows because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers. It's all really important for us."

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216,000,000, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year third quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%. 
Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior year period. 
As a result of our third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860,000,000 to $4,890,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed on the table within today's press release. 
Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. 
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal year 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in U.S. gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs. We have distinct competitive advantages: our corporate culture, which guides and drives everything that we do; our innovative and expansive product line that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition; and an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and broadest service structure in North America. 
These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better. These strong financial results, our unmatched scale, and our focus on the long term allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the product and service offerings compared to others in the industry. 
We were able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, ready for the workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers and helping them prepare for their work days. This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross-selling efforts. It's also energizing our partners, who are now even more ready for our customers. And we're able to make transformative investments such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes after Paul provides more third quarter details, but these investments will continue to strengthen our industry-leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get ready for the workday. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,328308428,955193,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter",911,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015. Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have one less day than this year. We estimate that this one less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. 
Note, however, that we continue to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; First Aid and Safety Services; and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 million, which was 50% higher than last year's third quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. 
On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is in process, the completion of which is integral to the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about 6 months. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of November 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $76 million in Uniform Rental; $6 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. 
Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike, who will provide some additional information related to our investment in SAP. Mike?"

We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing. With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million. We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. 
About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing it. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next 3 to 4 months and then move into the pilot stage. The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced 2 years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job. In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we've made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system into our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so. 
Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016, therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 years of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 years of system maintenance costs. 
The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal '17 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional -- other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but we'll likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our own industry struggle with these large implementation projects. Our financial strength and commitment to the long term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resource assisting us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm, has been working with us every step of the way. And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide. 
That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions."

We are really excited about it and it really speaks well of the value that we offer. I would say that reactions, though, to the campaign are primarily anecdotal. We hear a lot of good news from our locations, but it's too early to tell whether that's having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters. But getting back to the products and services, Joe, we spend a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invest a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers. And again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, ready for the workday. And Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail-inspired products like Carhartt and our wrinkle-free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer-focused solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions. And the beautiful thing about these products are they're all proprietary. All of these that I've mentioned are proprietary and can't be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will -- when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000-or-so customers out there that are warm leads. And even though they're warm leads, it -- we don't get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers. But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said, GDP and employment and the industry because in part, we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also -- we've got a very, very diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us. You see others in our industry, who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it we have products and services that just reach farther and reach broader than our competition. So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have, and we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on our R&D. I'm not ready to announce any new products, but Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry because we are innovative, we've got a broader product line, we've got a diverse customer base and we've got a great penetration opportunity. And we think that has served us very well in the past and will continue to serve us into the future."

Our First Aid and Safety business is doing a great job of digesting the ZEE acquisition, but keep in mind, that's a fairly large acquisition for them. It was more than 1/3 of the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business. That's priority #1. But clearly, yes, when we are on the SAP system, one of the benefits is that all of our operations will have more visibility and clarity into our customers and the different products and services that they have or don't have. And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration. But having said that, hey, look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, 2 more quarters of integration. The integration is going well. Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly, some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business, we're integrating a different business than Cintas is and we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that. Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers as well as starting to get into the ZEE penetration opportunities. We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business, but our ZEE customers generally have been only first aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training, services, AEDs, et cetera. And so we have -- we feel like we got a good penetration opportunity there, and I think our 11.9% organic growth speaks to that a little bit."

In terms of the energy, the cost side of it, though, I think the price per barrel really dropped low in our third quarter. I think it reached $26 at one point. It's kind of rebounded through the $40 threshold. So I think if it stays at about that level, more [ph] energy as a percent of our revenue would probably be more in line with our Q2, which was about 2.0% of revenue. And in Q4 last year, our energy was about 2.2%. So the bottom line is we're expecting probably about 20 basis points of benefit from the prices at the pump but then really offset by the headcount reductions that we expect to continue to incur into Q4."

Look, we think it's the right time to continue to get our brand awareness greater and greater throughout the country. We've had many customers over the years say to us, gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had fire protection services, I didn't know that you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking, we need to educate. And so we thought that, look, now is a great time to do this because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well. We've got a lot of great products, a lot of fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America that when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas. They can maybe help us get ready for the workday.

Yes, we absolutely think there are and that will be -- we'll incorporate those thoughts into our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So yes, we do think that ZEE is -- and the First Aid margins are certainly going to improve. From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind, this is the largest project that we've ever done. And as we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really starting to see the power of the system, and we're excited about getting this implemented and we believe that the power -- there is -- the power in the system that we had hoped for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure that we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers. And one of the risk-mitigating things about the way we're rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen one at a time. And so it's not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this one at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us, but it extends the rollout a little bit as well through that fiscal '18. And so we -- look, we think we're doing this the right way. As I mentioned, we've seen others both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that that's not going to happen to us. Now certainly those numbers that I gave you are fairly large. And as you know, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become in the next couple of years. Now in fiscal '17, look, we're only going to be on probably less than half of our locations and I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit in fiscal '18. We might start to see a little bit of system benefit, but it's going to be muted because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations. But having said that, again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact through our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will we be able to offset all $30 million to $35 million? No, but we'll do our best to manage that impact. 
Look, we don't do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that's going to carry us for a long time and it's worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years."

We've seen commentary from our salespeople that our customers are signaling out that they have seen the campaign, they like it and it piques interest at times in some of the things that we can do for them."

So effectively, for something like the last 46, 47 years, we've grown in 45 -- 44 of them. So that was a big one. And now the next recession, a lot depends on how deep and broad it is. But I -- one of the things that -- when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it, 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the health care space back then; we were not much in financial services and other professional environments. We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also First Aid and Fire Protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less -- or more resistant, unlike health care, to a recession. I think the other thing that I would say that's different is today, our Uniform, total Uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we lose many customers, but a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers like hygiene products and services, like the Fire Protection Services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire-resistant clothing. So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it."

And then I go back to this number you give us on the fourth quarter every year, and I guess I'm awaiting next quarter, of the mix within rental and the mix of all the 5 or 6 different things you give us has been exactly the same percentages for 4 straight fiscal years. So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past.

First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last 5 or 6 years and will continue to always be important to us. New business -- when we sell a new account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer. We have to earn the customer's trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us, first of all, because they bring revenue, but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities. And so new business will always be very important to us. It is now and will continue to be. And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it's a legacy rental metric. And when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn't apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions. That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements and we don't like to -- we don't pay attention to it quite as much internally because it's just losing its importance as we broaden our business. So I would say new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important. And the reason that you haven't seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because it's all been growing, and it's really important for us that it all grows because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers. It's all really important for us."

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. 
I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,271,000,000, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way, with an operating margin of 17.7%. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior-year period. 
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees whom we call partners in being READY for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry-leading results. 
Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base, with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of U.S. GDP and jobs each year since The Great Recession. And we are the clear leader in our industry and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. 
In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double digits in six consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. 
Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business and strategic investments like our SAP Project and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. 
This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. 
Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,150,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that this 1 less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points.",1657,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continued to come from no programmers or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no programmers in healthcare with scrub rental, those is construction and trades with Carhartt branded workwear and no programmers in customer facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation with performance, polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer including uniform in mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service and the less likely they are to leave us. 
Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter, were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note however, that we continue to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. 
So the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. 
First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. 
At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior-year data for comparability. The revenue mix for this segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year; dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years; hygiene and other services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year; shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue; linen and other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 9% compared to 8% last year; and catalog sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points. The majority of which falls within gross margin. 
Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior-year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. 
The reduction in first aid organic growth rate and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about 1/3 the size of our existing first aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short-term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation is still in process as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All these efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates and margins as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. 
The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%, that's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31, a decrease of $177 million from the balance as of February 29. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas' common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment. Please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. If one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a nonrecurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $9 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about a half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. 
Training costs, which are expensed when incurred, as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. 
The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019 but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions."

There are some seasonal impacts that impact us in the fourth quarter. For example, we have jackets coming off from the winter and being returned to the stock rooms. We have mats that are extra mats that some of the customers were snow and slush and those are returned as well. So typically, add-stops are negative in the fourth quarter and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to about 60 basis points and that's built into our guidance. So at the top line impact on the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin. The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points."

So Mike, thanks for the answer previously about some of the offsets that you had through the margins. Given that those headwinds are pretty significant, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail. And in the past, you mentioned that the ZEE integration, that you thought that the segment margins could get back up to the pre-ZEE levels, which I guess is, I don't know, 13-ish percent for the segment? Is that still the right goal? And what's the timeframe to which you think you can get those ZEE margins? Or to get these significant offsets, are you now eyeing above prior segment margin peaks?"

Yes, as far as ZEE is concerned, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with that acquisition. Everything is on track. We had mentioned previously that we need a full year to get through the integration. And so through May, we're about 75% of the way through. It's not turnkey. It's not standalone as you know. It's largely a tuck-in. And so when you have a tuck-in, you have a low [ph] short term, short-term efforts in order to get those synergies in the long-term. And that's definitely what were seeing in the First Aid segment as that impact the integration costs, rerouting, good will in customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate. But things are on track. We do expect gross margins to bounce back. We don't have a timeframe as far as, here's the timetable and the quarters and the milestones. But absolutely, we have another quarter of integration in fiscal '17 and we expect to see those margins bounce back and baked into our guidance for fiscal '17 as improvements in those First Aid and Safety margins and some stronger growth rates that you saw in the fourth quarter as well."

So it is a little bit -- the Uniform Rental side is a little bit lower in terms of the growth than the average. And we've been able to pick that up through the Facility Services, both in new business and in the penetration. And as Paul said, the retention. I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those three stick out dramatically? I would say, no. But I would say, that the penetration, we have lots of opportunity left. There is lots of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers. And we've been very successful with that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature Series, kind of a more front of the house hygiene business. And I think what I am describing kind of shows itself in the numbers that Paul gave, and that is that the Uniform Rental business was 51% of that revenue last year, it's now 50%.

I would say, as we look into fiscal '17, if I were to make a comment about the economy that maybe did feel a little different, I would say today compared to, let's call it, 6 months ago, it does feel like there's a bit more uncertainty. When you think about the -- we do -- we have seen some ups and downs in employment, no doubt about that. We've seen the European issues, we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers.

From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year. But we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see -- we'll see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint.

If we are higher than that for sustained periods of time, we worry that we're not investing enough. And I would tell you that as we look into '17, excluding the SAP impact, we're about in that same range, maybe a little bit on the lower side because of the negative oil and gas impact, because of the negative workday impact. But generally speaking, we think there are good incremental margins. And at the top end of the guidance, even with the SAP impact, even with the oil and gas, even with the extra workday, there's a slight operating margin improvement."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,271,000,000, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way, with an operating margin of 17.7%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period. 
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners, in being READY for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry-leading results. 
Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base, with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of U.S. GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession. And we are the clear leader in our industry and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. 
In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double digits in 6 consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. 
Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments including -- included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business and strategic investments like our SAP Project and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. 
This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. 
Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,150,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that this 1 less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points.",1656,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continued to come from no programmers or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no programmers in health care with scrub rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no programmers in customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation with Performance Polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service and the less likely they are to leave us. 
Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter, were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. 
So the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. 
At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for this segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year; dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years; hygiene and other services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year; shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue; linen and other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 9% compared to 8% last year; and catalog sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin. 
Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. 
The reduction in first aid organic growth rate and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about 1/3 the size of our existing first aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continued to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All these efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31, a decrease of $177 million from the balance as of February 29. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas' common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment. Please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a nonrecurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $9 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. 
Training costs, which are expensed when incurred, as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. 
The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So typically, add-stops are negative in the fourth quarter and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points. And that's built into our guidance. So at the top line impact on the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin.

I think I mentioned last quarter that it would probably be more like the second half of fiscal '17 before we would start to really be able to measure any kind of impact. Keeping in mind, it is a brand awareness campaign. So it is trying to make sure that our customers and our prospects understand and know all of the different things that we can provide to them, all of the different products and services. And we're not specifically targeting any one of them right now. So again, we're excited about it. It's going well. It's been -- the feedback that we get anecdotally has been very good.

One is the growth rate for Uniform versus All Other kind of categories within that Uniform segment. Are you still seeing the growths kind of trended a similar rate or are you starting to see them to diverge? And two, if I heard you right, it sounded like you highlighted new business wins, better penetration and even retention as kind of the biggest drivers to the entire segment. I'm curious if any of those 3 things are either accelerating or decelerating?"

And that has had a bit of a negative impact on the growth of the Uniform side relative to the whole segment. So it is a little bit -- the Uniform Rental side is a little bit lower in terms of the growth than the average. And we've been able to pick that up through the Facility Services, both in new business and in the penetration. And as Paul said, the retention. I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those 3 stick out dramatically? I would say, no. But I would say that the penetration we have lots of opportunity left. There is a lot of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers. And we've been very successful with that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature Series, kind of a more front of the house hygiene business. And I think what I am describing kind of shows itself in the numbers that Paul gave, and that is that the Uniform Rental business was 51% of that revenue last year, it's now 50%. The hygiene was 13% last year, it's now 14%. That's what you're seeing. You're seeing some lost oil, gas and mining customers, but it's being offset by some nice penetration and improvements in retention."

So that tells you that we don't -- we won't feel healed in that area in fiscal '17. From the rest of the, let's call it, economic picture, I would say that it's still a challenging environment. There's not a lot of momentum to it. But I would call it stable. We haven't seen a lot of change today compared to a quarter ago. And so I would say, we're continuing to operate like we have been. I would say, as we look into fiscal '17, if I were to make a comment about the economy that maybe did feel a little different, I would say today compared to, let's call it, 6 months ago, it does feel like there's a bit more uncertainty. When you think about the -- we do -- we have seen some ups and downs in employment, no doubt about that. We've seen the European issues, we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers. We've got the election coming up. It does feel like there's a little bit more uncertainty than there was 6 months ago. And that's likely bleeding into the bottom end of our guidance range."

I would expect that we're going to see a slightly lower tax rate in the first quarter followed by something closer to what we've typically guided toward in that 37% range in the last 3 quarters. So that's maybe one point. From a Ready for the Workday campaign standpoint, I would say that it is going to -- the bulk of it is going to be in the second and third quarters. From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see -- we'll see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint. And as far as calling things out, I think, maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I don't know that I'd have much more to share than that."

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,271,000,000, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way, with an operating margin of 17.7%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period. 
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners, in being READY for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry-leading results. 
Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base, with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of U.S. GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession. And we are the clear leader in our industry and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. 
In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double digits in 6 consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. 
Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments including -- included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business and strategic investments like our SAP Project and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. 
This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. 
Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,150,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that this 1 less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points.",1656,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continue to come from no-programmers [ph] or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no-programmers [ph] in health care with Scrub Rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no-programmers [ph] in customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation with Performance Polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service and the less likely they are to leave us. 
Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter, were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. 
So the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. 
At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for this segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year; dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years; hygiene and other services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year; shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue; linen and other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 9% compared to 8% last year; and catalog sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin. 
Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. 
The reduction in first aid organic growth rates and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about 1/3 the size of our existing first aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continued to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All these efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31, a decrease of $177 million from the balance as of February 29. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment, please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per generally accepted accounting principles, has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a nonrecurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $9 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. 
Training costs, which are expensed when incurred, as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. 
The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So typically, add-stops are negative in the fourth quarter and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points. And that's built into our guidance. So that's the top line impact. On the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin. The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs. Whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points."

That probably takes somewhere of 8 to 10 weeks. Then there's a turn through the distribution center and then it gets shipped out to our rental locations where it gets generally amortized over some period of time, mostly 18 months.

And that's definitely what we're seeing in the First Aid segment as that impact the integration costs, rerouting, goodwill in customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate. But things are on track. We do expect those margins to bounce back.

I would expect that we're going to see a slightly lower tax rate in the first quarter followed by something closer to what we've typically guided toward in that 37% range in the last 3 quarters. So that's maybe one point. From a Ready for the Workday campaign standpoint, I would say that it is going to -- the bulk of it is going to be in the second and third quarters. From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see -- we'll see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint. And as far as calling things out, I think, maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I don't know that I'd have much more to share than that."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,271,000,000, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way, with an operating margin of 17.7%. 
Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period. 
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners, in being READY for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry-leading results. 
Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base, with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of U.S. GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession. And we are the clear leader in our industry and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. 
In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double digits in 6 consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. 
Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments including -- included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business and strategic investments like our SAP Project and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. 
This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. 
Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5,150,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016. We estimate that this 1 less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,374071574,1008847,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points.",1656,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continue to come from no-programmers [ph] or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no-programmers [ph] in health care with Scrub Rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no-programmers [ph] in customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation with Performance Polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service and the less likely they are to leave us. 
Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter, were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. 
So the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. 
At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for this segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year; dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years; hygiene and other services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year; shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue; linen and other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 9% compared to 8% last year; and catalog sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin. 
Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. 
The reduction in first aid organic growth rates and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about 1/3 the size of our existing first aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continued to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All these efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31, a decrease of $177 million from the balance as of February 29. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. 
Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment, please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per generally accepted accounting principles, has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a nonrecurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $9 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. 
Training costs, which are expensed when incurred, as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. 
The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We have mats that -- that are extra mats, that some of the customers were snow and slush and those are returned as well. So typically, add-stops are negative in the fourth quarter and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points. And that's built into our guidance. So that's the top line impact. On the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin. The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs. Whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points."

It's largely a tuck-in. And so when you have a tuck-in, you have a little short term -- short-term efforts in order to get those synergies in the long term. And that's definitely what we're seeing in the First Aid segment as that impact the integration costs, rerouting, goodwill in customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate. But things are on track. We do expect those margins to bounce back. We don't have a time frame as far as here's the timetable and the quarters and the milestones.

I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those 3 stick out dramatically? I would say, no. But I would say that the penetration -- we have lots of opportunity left. There is a lot of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers. And we've been very successful with that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature Series, kind of a more front of the house hygiene business.

We've seen the European issues, we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers.

From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see -- we'll see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint. And as far as calling things out, I think, maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs.

The guidance does not assume any further share buyback. Maybe just to sync up, I don't know if you noticed, but with the earnings release, we have an income statement that we enclosed and there's a supplemental schedule in there that has a computation of diluted EPS. And if you look at that for the 12 months ended May 31, 2016, you'll see our computation there for the current year. When we start off with income from continuing ops, we reduce it. And it's about 1.6% reduction to allocate income to this participating securities, and then we divided that number by 110 million diluted shares outstanding. And so in fiscal '17, for our modeling, we're going to use about that same $110 million -- not million dollars, 110 million shares, rather, for computation of fiscal '17 EPS. So model your '17 number, reduce it for the income to the participating securities and look at 110 million shares."

But generally speaking, we think there are good incremental margins. And at the top end of the guidance, even with the SAP impact, even with the oil and gas, even with the extra workday, there's a slight operating margin improvement."

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,294,000,000, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. 
Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90 basis point expansion from the prior year. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. 
Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal '17 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16, partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense, reducing operating income, and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. 
Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging, so I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. 
Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal '17 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods, excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs, was 17.7% and 22.6%, respectively. 
As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record-breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal '17 revenue to be in the range of $5,160,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal '17 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal '17 compared to fiscal '16. 
It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, such that we expect to end fiscal '17 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. 
We and G&K have begun a process for satisfying these closing conditions. And at this stage, we don't expect the closing time line to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will, however, update the market as appropriate. I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,401977794,1050910,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1366,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continues to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. 
Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.7% last year. We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%. 
We continue to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin, resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. 
On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continues to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment's organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the required customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. 
Our integration game plan remains on track and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from improved sourcing and from a leveraging of existing warehouses, which are among the synergies we anticipated realizing. 
Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we have added sales reps. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 40.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70 basis point increase in SG&A year-over-year, about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP costs related to the piloted operations. In addition, medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal '17 by about $2 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing of long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal '17 to be about 34.7%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31, a decrease of $46 million from the balances on May 31. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period. And when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. 
Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $8 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process, which has progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. 
The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. 
We are pleased with the conversion, and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018.
The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions, I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market, however, as appropriate. And with that, we are happy to answer your questions."

That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the year goes on. And I would suggest that based on our first quarter experience, might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk 2 things. First of all, yes, the revenue, we expect that the impact will lessen as we go through the year.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,294,000,000, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. 
Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90 basis point expansion from the prior year. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. 
Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal '17 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16, partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. 
Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impacts of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging, so I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal '17 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods, excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs, was 17.7% and 22.6%, respectively. 
As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record-breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal '17 revenue to be in the range of $5,160,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal '17 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal '17 compared to fiscal '16. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, such that we expect to end fiscal '17 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions, and at this stage, we don't expect the closing time line to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will, however, update the market as appropriate. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,401977794,1050965,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1368,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continues to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. 
Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.7% last year. We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%. 
We continue to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin, resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continues to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment's organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates as we on-board and goodwill the acquire customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration game plan remains on track, and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from improved sourcing and from a leveraging of existing warehouses, which are among the synergies we anticipated realizing. 
Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we have added sales reps. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 40.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70 basis point increase in SG&A year-over-year, about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP costs related to the piloted operations. In addition, medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal '17 by about $2 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal '17 to be about 34.7%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31, a decrease of $46 million from the balances on May 31. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period. And when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process, which has progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We are pleased with the conversion, and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions, I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market, however, as appropriate.

We expected to be able to have better ability to purchase, and we're seeing those benefits in cost of goods would translate into that gross margin. We're also seeing benefits from distribution. They had 5 distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them, and so we're leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution, supply chain for that. And another example is we mentioned warehousing in the script, which is the locations, the physical operations that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale, even though this is a sizable acquisition for the First Aid segment and it's largely a tuck-in.

That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the year goes on. And I would suggest that, based on our first quarter experience, might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk 2 things. First of all, yes, the revenue, we expect that the impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint, when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I would suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point, if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,294,000,000, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. 
Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90-basis-point expansion from the prior year. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. 
Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal '17 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16, partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. 
Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impacts of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging, so I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal '17 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods, excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs, was 17.7% and 22.6%, respectively. 
As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record-breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal '17 revenue to be in the range of $5,160,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal '17 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal '17 compared to fiscal '16. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, such that we expect to end fiscal '17 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions, and at this stage, we don't expect the closing time line to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will, however, update the market as appropriate. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,401977794,1050991,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1365,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continues to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. 
Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.7% last year. We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%. 
We continue to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin, resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continues to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates as we on-board and goodwill the acquire customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration game plan remains on track, and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from improved sourcing and from a leveraging of existing warehouses, which are among the synergies we anticipated realizing. 
Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we have added sales reps. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 40.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70-basis-point increase in SG&A year-over-year, about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP costs related to the piloted operations. In addition, medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal '17 by about $2 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal '17 to be about 34.7%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31, a decrease of $46 million from the balances of May 31. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period. And when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process, which has progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We are pleased with the conversion, and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions, I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market, however, as appropriate. And with that, we are happy to answer your questions."

We expected to be able to have better ability to purchase, and we're seeing those benefits in cost of goods which translates into that gross margin. We're also seeing benefits from distribution. They had 5 distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them, and so we're leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution, supply chain for that. And another example is we mentioned warehousing in the script, which is the locations, the physical operations that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale, even though this is a sizable acquisition for the First Aid segment, it's largely a tuck-in. And by tucking this business in to these existing locations, we were starting to realize those synergies. And that's really what's pushing those margins forward as I said we expected."

We -- let me maybe talk a little bit about the economy and thinking in terms of -- it's been a -- it remains a challenging environment, and I would -- I think I called it stable without momentum in July, and I would say the same thing today. And if you look at the last 3 quarters of GDP in the U.S., the average is slightly under 1%. The 3 quarters preceding our first quarter last year, that average was 2.3%. And so we've certainly seen a bit more of a challenging environment.

That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the year goes on. And I would suggest that, based on our first quarter experience, might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk 2 things. First of all, yes, the revenue, we expect that the impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint, when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I would suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point, if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year. One thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter, we now have lapped that ZEE acquisition, and so now our future growth -- our future revenue growth for the rest of the year will not have the revenue, the acquisition benefit going forward from that ZEE deal."

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
We're pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,294,000,000, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. 
Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90-basis-point expansion from the prior year. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. 
Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal '17 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16, partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. 
Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impacts of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging, so I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal '17 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods, excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs, was 17.7% and 22.6%, respectively. 
As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record-breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal '17 revenue to be in the range of $5,160,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal '17 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal '17 compared to fiscal '16. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, such that we expect to end fiscal '17 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions, and at this stage, we don't expect the closing time line to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will, however, update the market as appropriate. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,401977794,1051427,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1365,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. 
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continues to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. 
Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.7% last year. We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%. 
We continue to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin, resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continues to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts have a short-term impact to growth rates as we on-board and goodwill the acquire customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration game plan remains on track, and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from improved sourcing and from a leveraging of existing warehouses, which are among the synergies we anticipated realizing. 
Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we have added sales reps. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 40.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter. 
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70-basis-point increase in SG&A year-over-year, about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP costs related to the piloted operations. In addition, medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned. 
On June 1, $250 million of debt with a coupon of 2.85% matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal '17 by about $2 million and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal '17 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal '17 to be about 34.7%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31, a decrease of $46 million from the balances of May 31. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period. And when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. 
Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process, which has progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about 0.5 year of depreciation. It will also include about 0.5 year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We are pleased with the conversion, and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions, I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market, however, as appropriate. And with that, we are happy to answer your questions."

They had 5 distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them, and so we're leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution, supply chain for that. And another example is we mentioned warehousing in the script, which is the locations, the physical operations that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale, even though this is a sizable acquisition for the First Aid segment, it's largely a tuck-in. And by tucking this business in to these existing locations, we were starting to realize those synergies. And that's really what's pushing those margins forward as I said we expected."

That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the year goes on. And I would suggest that, based on our first quarter experience, might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk 2 things. First of all, yes, the revenue, we expect that the impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint, when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I would suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point, if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,297,000,000, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter.
Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned, this accomplishment, plus our industry-leading organic sales growth, is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1%, representing both the year-over-year and the sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points, respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13, which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses, net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter; and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter.
We're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5,180,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.
As Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so, delivering best-in-class results.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We're excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K's shareholders in November. We continue to work toward attaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017.
In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate.
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,413118050,1105140,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2016",2016-12-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1721,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.
For those of you modeling our results by quarter, please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes. In this year, it will also be negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. In addition, energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally, we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter, driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic growth rate was 6.5%.
We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries. However, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about a 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom, followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final month of the quarter.
We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investment, in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve.
In the interim, we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over 2 years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously, the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margins expanded.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments as well as a 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system; the national branding campaign, Ready for the Workday; and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers in our First Aid and Safety segments. Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we are self-insured, and we had a handful of atypical, very expensive claims in the quarter.
I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investment in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the pilot of operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilot. Also, with the upcoming acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort. As a result, we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million.
As of November 30, short-term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporarily higher as of the end of our third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year's annual dividend. We have increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional value of $550 million for forecasted debt issuance. In anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect Cintas from rising interest rates, we recently entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlement of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.
Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.
Finally, in the second quarter, we received the payment from the buyer of our investment in Shred-it. Proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the Investing section of the cash flow statement.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the other items that Paul pointed out in terms of -- let me speak to SAP for a second. We certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation. The spend that we have talked about tonight, $20 million to $25 million, as you can imagine, the bulk of that is in the second half of the year, but it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion. And so we're going to make sure that we have a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter, without that medical spike, we're up about 70 basis points.

I think if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle, we were kind of building the footprint still. We were adding sales reps, and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully built out that footprint and as we got into the Great Recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative. And we have to create products and services that our customers really  value and want to use. We've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we've got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps. We've got an active R&D program. We are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there's no doubt we've kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we're building a footprint to a company that's really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we've got some exciting things ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we're going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we've got -- certainly, the biggest assets are our people and our culture. But really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we've got is a great infrastructure to provide services to close to 1 million businesses, and we've got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well.

I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we'll do our best to work around that. So for example, we have production in Haiti, and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti. We have some NAFTA benefits. And if those go away, then we'll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, specifically garments, let's keep in mind, rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals, we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost. And so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor. And so we will work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I'm telling you is it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not significant, and it happens over a long period of time. So, for example, we have to go source it. Then we bring it to our distribution center where it stays for a turn. Then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and the amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing. And while we're going through that long supply chain time frame, we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately."

I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a system spend is to say, we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over the last couple of calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19 and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal.

And the first thing that we needed to do was get that business onto our systems. When we are operating on their system, it's hard for us to go and hire a sales rep and put them on to their system and -- because that would require them to sell ZEE legacy product. And as you can imagine, one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas product. This, in ZEE's case, they didn't have salespeople. They let -- they had their drivers, their service sales reps or as we call them SSRs, they had their SSRs do the selling. And they didn't have a dedicated sales force. So as we brought them on, the first thing we needed to do was convert them onto our system. That, as we talked about, took us really through the entire fiscal '16 year. And so as we are doing that conversion onto our system, then we have to make sure that we train those SSRs on our products and services. And then we do what we've talked about as a route optimization, and that route optimization then takes those ZEE legacy routes now that they're on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market, and that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer. And that's when we really like to then start to see the salespeople start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in ZEE -- in the case of ZEE, we didn't invest in salespeople early on because it would've required us to sell for some period of time the ZEE product. And that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected. And now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization, we are ready to really begin aggressively selling. And we should see that organic growth improve."

And that is because a combination of things such as -- there is some disruption, certainly. And that disruption sometimes creates the customer or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it's hard to sell -- it's hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs, the salespeople, how to sell Cintas product, how to sell using our policies, using our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period, we then start to expect that those resources, those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post closing of that transaction. But the really good news is, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks going back to ZEE for a second, our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars. And so while there is some pressure on the top line, we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create."

We want to make sure that we are fully staffed as much as possible. And so that's the only thing I would say. It may put a little bit of pressure on that second half of the year.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,297,000,000, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter.
Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned, this accomplishment, plus our industry-leading organic sales growth, is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1%, representing both the year-over-year and the sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points, respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13, which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses, net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter; and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter.
We're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5,180,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.
As Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so, delivering best-in-class results.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We're excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K's shareholders in November. We continue to work toward attaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017.
In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate.
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,413118050,1105158,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2016",2016-12-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1721,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.
For those of you modeling our results by quarter, please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes. In this year, it will also be negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. In addition, energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally, we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter, driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic growth rate was 6.5%.
We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries. However, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about a 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom, followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final month of the quarter.
We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investment, in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve.
In the interim, we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over 2 years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously, the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margins expanded.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments as well as a 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system; the national branding campaign, Ready for the Workday; and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers in our First Aid and Safety segments. Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we are self-insured, and we had a handful of atypical, very expensive claims in the quarter.
I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investment in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the pilot of operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilot. Also, with the upcoming acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort. As a result, we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million.
As of November 30, short-term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporarily higher as of the end of our third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year's annual dividend. We have increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional value of $550 million for forecasted debt issuance. In anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect Cintas from rising interest rates, we recently entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlement of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.
Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.
Finally, in the second quarter, we received the payment from the buyer of our investment in Shred-it. Proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the Investing section of the cash flow statement.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the other items that Paul pointed out in terms of -- let me speak to SAP for a second. We certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation. The spend that we have talked about tonight, $20 million to $25 million, as you can imagine, the bulk of that is in the second half of the year, but it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion. And so we're going to make sure that we have a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter, without that medical spike, we're up about 70 basis points. And we will continue to invest in SAP in preparation for the G&K closing, and we'll have some of that Ready for the Workday. So yes, Toni, we will see some heightened SG&A as we continue to prepare for these 2 large projects. We want to make sure that we are providing the right resources for each of them."

But I would say again, Toni, we are ways away from seeing anything yet. And I -- as we think about our year, we're not including any benefits from changes from the new administration. We absolutely like how our year is going so far. We've got a very good organic growth rate. We've seen rental continue to be strong. First aid is going to continue to be strong in the second half of the year. We've seen some really nice gross margins and gross margin improvement.

I think today and over the last 5 years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle, we were kind of building the footprint still. We were adding sales reps, and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully built out that footprint and as we got into the Great Recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative. And we have to create products and services that our customers really  value and want to use. We've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we've got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps. We've got an active R&D program. We are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there's no doubt we've kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we're building a footprint to a company that's really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we've got some exciting things ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we're going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we've got -- certainly, the biggest assets are our people and our culture. But really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we've got is a great infrastructure to provide services to close to 1 million businesses, and we've got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services, and I think that's something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward."

I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we'll do our best to work around that. So for example, we have production in Haiti, and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti. We have some NAFTA benefits. And if those go away, then we'll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, specifically garments, let's keep in mind, rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals, we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost. And so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor, and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I'm telling you is it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not significant, and it happens over a long period of time. So for example, we have to go source it. Then we bring it into our distribution center where it stays for a turn. Then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing. And while we're going through that long supply chain time frame, we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately."

And so we may come and say, look, when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend. But I'm not ready to say that we will yet. I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a system spend is to say we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over the last couple calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19 and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal. And as you know, we talked about one of the longer pulls in that -- in the synergy effort with G&K is that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it.

So we -- let's go back to we made that deal in August of 2015, and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we are operating on their system, it's hard for us to go and hire a sales rep and put them on to their system and -- because that would require them to sell ZEE legacy product. And as you can imagine, one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas product. This -- in ZEE's case, they didn't have salespeople. They let -- they had their drivers, their service sales reps or as we call them SSRs, they had their SSRs do the selling and they didn't have a dedicated sales force. So as we brought them on, the first thing we needed to do was convert them onto our system. That, as we've talked about, took us really through the entire fiscal '16 year. And so as we are doing that conversion onto our system, then we have to make sure that we train those SSRs on our products and services. And then we do what we've talked about as a route optimization, and that route optimization then takes those ZEE legacy routes now that they're on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market, and that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer. And that's when we really like to then start to see the salespeople start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in ZEE -- in the case of ZEE, we didn't invest in salespeople early on because it would've required us to sell for some period of time the ZEE product, and that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected. And now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization, we are ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve."

And that's true for every acquisition that we've made, and that is because a combination of things such as -- there's some disruption certainly, and that disruption sometimes creates the customer or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it's hard to sell -- it's hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs, and the salespeople how to sell Cintas product, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period, we then start to expect that those resources -- those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post closing of that transaction. But the really good news is as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks, going back to ZEE for a second, our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars. And so while there is some pressure on the top line, we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create."

Going into the second half of this year, the only thing that I would say is we will be a little bit more aggressive in making sure that open positions in our rental business are filled so that when we are ready to close the G&K transaction, we're not trying to both fill our open positions and perform integration. We want to make sure that we are fully staffed as much as possible. And so that's the only thing I would say. It may put a little bit of pressure on that second half of the year.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,297,000,000, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter.
Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned, this accomplishment, plus our industry-leading organic sales growth, is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1%, representing both the year-over-year and a sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points, respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13, which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses, net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter; and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter.
We're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5,180,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.
As Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so, delivering best-in-class results.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We're excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K's shareholders in November. We continue to work toward attaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017.
In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate.
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,413118050,1105165,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2016",2016-12-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1720,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.
For those of you modeling our results by quarter, please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes. In this year, it will also be negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. In addition, energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally, we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter, driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic growth rate was 6.5%.
We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries. However, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about a 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom, followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final month of the quarter.
We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investment, in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve.
In the interim, we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over 2 years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously, the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margins expanded.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments as well as a 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system; the national branding campaign, Ready for the Workday; and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers in our First Aid and Safety segments. Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we are self-insured, and we had a handful of atypical, very expensive claims in the quarter.
I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investment in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the piloted operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilots. Also, with the upcoming acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort. As a result, we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million.
As of November 30, short-term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporarily higher as of the end of our third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year's annual dividend. We have increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional value of $550 million for forecasted debt issuance. In anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect Cintas from rising interest rates, we recently entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlements of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.
Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.
Finally, in the second quarter, we received a payment from the buyer of our investment in Shred-it. Proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the Investing section of the cash flow statements.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

And so we're going to make sure that we have a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter, without that medical spike, we're up about 70 basis points. And we will continue to invest in SAP in preparation for the G&K closing, and we'll have some of that Ready for the Workday. So yes, Toni, we will see some heightened SG&A as we continue to prepare for these 2 large projects. We want to make sure that we are providing the right resources for each of them."

And then if we see some infrastructure spend, that's going to be good for construction, for equipment. And certainly, that's going to benefit our customers and eventually benefit us. But I would say again, Toni, we are a ways away from seeing anything yet. And I -- as we think about our year, we're not including any benefits from changes from the new administration. We absolutely like how our year is going so far. We've got a very good organic growth rate. We've seen rental continue to be strong. First aid is going to continue to be strong in the second half of the year. We've seen some really nice gross margins and gross margin improvement.

I think today and over the last 5 years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle, we were kind of building the footprint still. We were adding sales reps, and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully built out that footprint and as we got into the Great Recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative. And we have to create products and services that our customers really value and want to use. We've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we've got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps. We've got an active R&D program. We are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there's no doubt we've kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we're building a footprint to a company that's really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we've got some exciting things ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we're going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we've got -- certainly, the biggest assets are our people and our culture. But really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we've got is a great infrastructure to provide services to close to 1 million businesses, and we've got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services, and I think that's something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward."

I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we'll do our best to work around that. So for example, we have production in Haiti, and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti. We have some NAFTA benefits. And if those go away, then we'll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, specifically garments, let's keep in mind, rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals, we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost. And so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor, and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I'm telling you is it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not significant, and it happens over a long period of time. So for example, we have to go source it. Then we bring it into our distribution center where it stays for a turn. Then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing. And while we're going through that long supply chain time frame, we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately."

And so we may come and say, look, when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend. But I'm not ready to say that we will yet. I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a system spend is to say we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over the last couple calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19 and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal. And as you know, we've talked about one of the longer pulls in that -- in the synergy effort with G&K is that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it.

New business remains strong. Penetration remains strong with things like our Signature Series hygiene products and services, with our entrance mats. And I would say that we haven't seen much of a change in the mix of the revenue growth other than to say that, that oil and gas customer base, the stops or the reduction in revenue at those types of customers has subsided a little bit. But aside from that, it is continuing to execute the way we have for quite a while now and that is no programmers being very strong, new business efforts in total being strong and continuing to find penetration opportunities."

So we -- let's go back to we made that deal in August of 2015, and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we are operating on their system, it's hard for us to go and hire a sales rep and put them on to their system and -- because that would require them to sell ZEE legacy product. And as you can imagine, one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas product. This -- in ZEE's case, they didn't have salespeople. They let -- they had their drivers, their service sales reps or as we call them SSRs, they had their SSRs do the selling and they didn't have a dedicated sales force. So as we brought them on, the first thing we needed to do was convert them onto our system. That, as we've talked about, took us really through the entire fiscal '16 year. And so as we are doing that conversion onto our system, then we have to make sure that we train those SSRs on our products and services. And then we do what we've talked about as a route optimization, and that route optimization then takes those ZEE legacy routes now that they're on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market, and that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer. And that's when we really like to then start to see the salespeople start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in ZEE -- in the case of ZEE, we didn't invest in salespeople early on because it would've required us to sell for some period of time the ZEE product, and that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected. And now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization, we are ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve."

And that's true for every acquisition that we've made, and that is because a combination of things such as -- there's some disruption certainly, and that disruption sometimes creates the customer or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it's hard to sell -- it's hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs, and the salespeople how to sell Cintas product, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period, we then start to expect that those resources -- those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post-closing of that transaction. But the really good news is, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks, going back to ZEE for a second, our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars. And so while there is some pressure on the top line, we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,297,000,000, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter.
Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned, this accomplishment, plus our industry-leading organic sales growth, is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1%, representing both the year-over-year and a sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points, respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13, which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses, net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to last year's second quarter; and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter.
We're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5,180,000,000 to $5,225,000,000 and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting and the impact of 1 less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.
As Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so, delivering best-in-class results.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We're excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K's shareholders in November. We continue to work toward attaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017.
In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate.
I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."
260725,413118050,1105390,"Cintas Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2016",2016-12-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 201",1720,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has 1 less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.
For those of you modeling our results by quarter, please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes. In this year, it will also be negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. In addition, energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally, we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter, driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic growth rate was 6.5%.
We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries. However, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about a 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom, followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final month of the quarter.
We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investment, in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve.
In the interim, we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over 2 years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously, the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margins expanded.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments as well as a 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system; the national branding campaign, Ready for the Workday; and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers in our First Aid and Safety segments. Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we are self-insured, and we had a handful of atypical, very expensive claims in the quarter.
I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investment in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the piloted operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilots. Also, with the upcoming acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort. As a result, we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million.
As of November 30, short-term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporarily higher as of the end of our third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year's annual dividend. We have increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional value of $550 million for forecasted debt issuance. In anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect Cintas from rising interest rates, we recently entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlements of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.
Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.
Finally, in the second quarter, we received a payment from the buyer of our investment in Shred-it. Proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the Investing section of the cash flow statements.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation. The spend that we have talked about tonight, $20 million to $25 million, as you can imagine, the bulk of that is in the second half of the year, but it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion. And so we're going to make sure that we have a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter, without that medical spike, we're up about 70 basis points.

I think today and over the last 5 years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle, we were kind of building the footprint still. We were adding sales reps, and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully built out that footprint and as we got into the Great Recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative. And we have to create products and services that our customers really value and want to use. We've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we've got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps. We've got an active R&D program. We are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there's no doubt we've kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we're building a footprint to a company that's really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we've got some exciting things ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we're going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we've got -- certainly, the biggest assets are our people and our culture. But really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we've got is a great infrastructure to provide services to close to 1 million businesses, and we've got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services, and I think that's something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward."

I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we'll do our best to work around that. So for example, we have production in Haiti, and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti. We have some NAFTA benefits. And if those go away, then we'll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, specifically garments, let's keep in mind, rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals, we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost. And so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor, and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I'm telling you is it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not significant, and it happens over a long period of time. So for example, we have to go source it. Then we bring it into our distribution center where it stays for a turn. Then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing. And while we're going through that long supply chain time frame, we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately."

And so we may come and say, look, when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend. But I'm not ready to say that we will yet. I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a system spend is to say we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over the last couple calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19 and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal. And as you know, we've talked about one of the longer pulls in that -- in the synergy effort with G&K is that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it.

So we -- let's go back to we made that deal in August of 2015, and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we are operating on their system, it's hard for us to go and hire a sales rep and put them on to their system and -- because that would require them to sell ZEE legacy product. And as you can imagine, one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas product. This -- in ZEE's case, they didn't have salespeople. They let -- they had their drivers, their service sales reps or as we call them SSRs, they had their SSRs do the selling and they didn't have a dedicated sales force. So as we brought them on, the first thing we needed to do was convert them onto our system. That, as we've talked about, took us really through the entire fiscal '16 year. And so as we are doing that conversion onto our system, then we have to make sure that we train those SSRs on our products and services. And then we do what we've talked about as a route optimization, and that route optimization then takes those ZEE legacy routes now that they're on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market, and that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer. And that's when we really like to then start to see the salespeople start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in ZEE -- in the case of ZEE, we didn't invest in salespeople early on because it would've required us to sell for some period of time the ZEE product, and that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected. And now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization, we are ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve."

And that's true for every acquisition that we've made, and that is because a combination of things such as -- there's some disruption certainly, and that disruption sometimes creates the customer or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it's hard to sell -- it's hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs, and the salespeople how to sell Cintas product, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period, we then start to expect that those resources -- those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post-closing of that transaction. But the really good news is, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks, going back to ZEE for a second, our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars. And so while there is some pressure on the top line, we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create."
